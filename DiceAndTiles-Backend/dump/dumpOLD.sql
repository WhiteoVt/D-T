3	161936	Pandemic Legacy: Season 1	Pandemic Legacy is a co-operative campaign game, with an overarching story-arc played through 12-24 sessions, depending on how well your group does at the game. At the beginning, the game starts very similar to basic Pandemic, in which your team of disease-fighting specialists races against the clock to travel around the world, treating disease hotspots while researching cures for each of four plagues before they get out of hand.&#10;&#10;During a player's turn, they have four actions available, with which they may travel around in the world in various ways (sometimes needing to discard a card), build structures like research stations, treat diseases (removing one cube from the board; if all cubes of a color have been removed, the disease has been eradicated), trade cards with other players, or find a cure for a disease (requiring five cards of the same color to be discarded while at a research station). Each player has a unique role with special abilities to help them at these actions.&#10;&#10;After a player has taken their actions, they draw two cards. These cards can include epidemic cards, which will place new disease cubes on the board, and can lead to an outbreak, spreading disease cubes even further. Outbreaks additionally increase the panic level of a city, making that city more expensive to travel to.&#10;&#10;Each month in the game, you have two chances to achieve that month's objectives. If you succeed, you win and immediately move on to the next month. If you fail, you have a second chance, with more funding for beneficial event cards.&#10;&#10;During the campaign, new rules and components will be introduced. These will sometimes require you to permanently alter the components of the game; this includes writing on cards, ripping up cards, and placing permanent stickers on components. Your characters can gain new skills, or detrimental effects. A character can even be lost entirely, at which point it's no longer available for play.&#10;&#10;Part of the Pandemic series&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/-Qer2BBPG7qGGDu6KcVDIw__original/img/PlzAH7swN1nsFxOXbfUvE3TkE5w=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic2452831.png	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/-Qer2BBPG7qGGDu6KcVDIw__thumb/img/NQQcjS31TO0DE246N9rpt0hd9eo=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2452831.png
4	174430	Gloomhaven	Gloomhaven  is a game of Euro-inspired tactical combat in a persistent world of shifting motives. Players will take on the role of a wandering adventurer with their own special set of skills and their own reasons for traveling to this dark corner of the world. Players must work together out of necessity to clear out menacing dungeons and forgotten ruins. In the process, they will enhance their abilities with experience and loot, discover new locations to explore and plunder, and expand an ever-branching story fueled by the decisions they make.&#10;&#10;This is a game with a persistent and changing world that is ideally played over many game sessions. After a scenario, players will make decisions on what to do, which will determine how the story continues, kind of like a &ldquo;Choose Your Own Adventure&rdquo; book. Playing through a scenario is a cooperative affair where players will fight against automated monsters using an innovative card system to determine the order of play and what a player does on their turn.&#10;&#10;Each turn, a player chooses two cards to play out of their hand. The number on the top card determines their initiative for the round. Each card also has a top and bottom power, and when it is a player&rsquo;s turn in the initiative order, they determine whether to use the top power of one card and the bottom power of the other, or vice-versa. Players must be careful, though, because over time they will permanently lose cards from their hands. If they take too long to clear a dungeon, they may end up exhausted and be forced to retreat.&#10;&#10;	\N	1	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/sZYp_3BTDGjh2unaZfZmuA__original/img/7d-lj5Gd1e8PFnD97LYFah2c45M=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2437871.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/sZYp_3BTDGjh2unaZfZmuA__thumb/img/veqFeP4d_3zNhFc3GNBkV95rBEQ=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2437871.jpg
5	342942	Ark Nova	In Ark Nova, you will plan and design a modern, scientifically managed zoo. With the ultimate goal of owning the most successful zoological establishment, you will build enclosures, accommodate animals, and support conservation projects all over the world. Specialists and unique buildings will help you in achieving this goal.&#10;&#10;Each player has a set of five action cards to manage their gameplay, and the power of an action is determined by the slot the card currently occupies. The cards in question are:&#10;&#10;&#10;    CARDS: Allows you to gain new zoo cards (animals, sponsors, and conservation project cards).&#10;    BUILD: Allows you to build standard or special enclosures, kiosks, and pavilions.&#10;    ANIMALS: Allows you to accommodate animals in your zoo.&#10;    ASSOCIATION: Allows your association workers to carry out different tasks.&#10;    SPONSORS: Allows you to play a sponsor card in your zoo or to raise money.&#10;&#10;&#10;255 cards featuring animals, specialists, special enclosures, and conservation projects, each with a special ability, are at the heart of Ark Nova. Use them to increase the appeal and scientific reputation of your zoo and collect conservation points.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;	\N	1	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/SoU8p28Sk1s8MSvoM4N8pQ__original/img/g4S18szTdrXCdIwVKzMKrZrYAcM=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic6293412.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/SoU8p28Sk1s8MSvoM4N8pQ__thumb/img/4KuHNTWSMPf8vTNDKSRMMI3oOv8=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6293412.jpg
6	233078	Twilight Imperium: Fourth Edition	Twilight Imperium (Fourth Edition) is a game of galactic conquest in which three to six players take on the role of one of seventeen factions vying for galactic domination through military might, political maneuvering, and economic bargaining. Every faction offers a completely different play experience, from the wormhole-hopping Ghosts of Creuss to the Emirates of Hacan, masters of trade and economics. These seventeen races are offered many paths to victory, but only one may sit upon the throne of Mecatol Rex as the new masters of the galaxy.&#10;&#10;No two games of Twilight Imperium are ever identical. At the start of each galactic age, the game board is uniquely and strategically constructed using 51 galaxy tiles that feature everything from lush new planets and supernovas to asteroid fields and gravity rifts. Players are dealt a hand of these tiles and take turns creating the galaxy around Mecatol Rex, the capital planet seated in the center of the board. An ion storm may block your race from progressing through the galaxy while a fortuitously placed gravity rift may protect you from your closest foes. The galaxy is yours to both craft and dominate.&#10;&#10;A round of Twilight Imperium begins with players selecting one of eight strategy cards that both determine player order and give their owner a unique strategic action for that round. These may do anything from providing additional command tokens to allowing a player to control trade throughout the galaxy. After these roles are selected, players take turns moving their fleets from system to system, claiming new planets for their empire, and engaging in warfare and trade with other factions. At the end of a turn, players gather in a grand council to pass new laws and agendas, shaking up the game in unpredictable ways.&#10;&#10;After every player has passed their turn, players move up the victory track by checking to see whether they have completed any objectives throughout the turn and scoring them. Objectives are determined by setting up ten public objective cards at the start of each game, then gradually revealing them with every round. Every player also chooses between two random secret objectives at the start of the game, providing victory points achievable only by the holder of that objective. These objectives can be anything from researching new technologies to taking your neighbor's home system. At the end of every turn, a player can claim one public objective and one secret objective. As play continues, more of these objectives are revealed and more secret objectives are dealt out, giving players dynamically changing goals throughout the game. Play continues until a player reaches ten victory points.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;	\N	3	6	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/_Ppn5lssO5OaildSE-FgFA__original/img/kVpZ0Maa_LeQGWxOqsYKP3N4KUY=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3727516.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/_Ppn5lssO5OaildSE-FgFA__thumb/img/lfEukJE0JsoZZObaF9K9YnFp62E=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3727516.jpg
7	167791	Terraforming Mars	In the 2400s, mankind begins to terraform the planet Mars. Giant corporations, sponsored by the World Government on Earth, initiate huge projects to raise the temperature, the oxygen level, and the ocean coverage until the environment is habitable. In Terraforming Mars, you play one of those corporations and work together in the terraforming process, but compete for getting victory points that are awarded not only for your contribution to the terraforming, but also for advancing human infrastructure throughout the solar system, and doing other commendable things.&#10;&#10;The players acquire unique project cards (from over two hundred different ones) by buying them to their hand. The cards can give you immediate bonuses, as well as increasing your production of different resources. Many cards also have requirements and they become playable when the temperature, oxygen, or ocean coverage increases enough. Buying cards is costly, so there is a balance between buying cards and actually playing them. Standard Projects are always available to complement your cards. Your basic income, as well as your basic score, is based on your Terraform Rating. However, your income is complemented with your production, and you also get VPs from many other sources.&#10;&#10;Each player keeps track of their production and resources on their player boards, and the game uses six types of resources: MegaCredits, Steel, Titanium, Plants, Energy, and Heat. On the game board, you compete for the best places for your city tiles, ocean tiles, and greenery tiles. You also compete for different Milestones and Awards worth many VPs. Each round is called a generation and consists of the following phases:&#10;&#10;1) Player order shifts clockwise.&#10;2) Research phase: All players buy cards from four privately drawn.&#10;3) Action phase: Players take turns doing 1-2 actions from these options: Playing a card, claiming a Milestone, funding an Award, using a Standard project, converting plant into greenery tiles (and raising oxygen), converting heat into a temperature raise, and using the action of a card in play. The turn continues around the table (sometimes several laps) until all players have passed.&#10;4) Production phase: Players get resources according to their terraform rating and production parameters.&#10;&#10;When the three global parameters (temperature, oxygen, ocean) have all reached their goal, the terraforming is complete, and the game ends after that generation. Count your Terraform Rating and other VPs to determine the winning corporation!&#10;&#10;	\N	1	5	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/wg9oOLcsKvDesSUdZQ4rxw__original/img/thIqWDnH9utKuoKVEUqveDixprI=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3536616.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/wg9oOLcsKvDesSUdZQ4rxw__thumb/img/BTxqxgYay5tHJfVoJ2NF5g43_gA=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3536616.jpg
8	316554	Dune: Imperium	Dune: Imperium is a game that uses deck-building to add a hidden-information angle to traditional worker placement. It finds inspiration in elements and characters from the Dune legacy, both the new film from Legendary Pictures and the seminal literary series from Frank Herbert, Brian Herbert, and Kevin J. Anderson.&#10;&#10;As a leader of one of the Great Houses of the Landsraad, raise your banner and marshal your forces and spies. War is coming, and at the center of the conflict is Arrakis &ndash; Dune, the desert planet.&#10;&#10;You start with a unique leader card, as well as a deck identical to those of your opponents.  As you acquire cards and build your deck, your choices will define your strengths and weaknesses. Cards allow you to send your Agents to certain spaces on the game board, so how your deck evolves affects your strategy. You might become more powerful militarily, able to deploy more troops than your opponents. Or you might acquire cards that give you an edge with the four political factions represented in the game: the Emperor, the Spacing Guild, the Bene Gesserit, and the Fremen.&#10;&#10;Unlike many deck-building games, you don&rsquo;t play your entire hand in one turn. Instead, you draw a hand of cards at the start of every round and alternate with other players, taking one Agent turn at a time (playing one card to send one of your Agents to the game board). When it&rsquo;s your turn and you have no more Agents to place, you&rsquo;ll take a Reveal turn, revealing the rest of your cards, which will provide Persuasion and Swords. Persuasion is used to acquire more cards, and Swords help your troops fight for the current round&rsquo;s rewards as shown on the revealed Conflict card.&#10;&#10;Defeat your rivals in combat, shrewdly navigate the political factions, and acquire precious cards. The Spice must flow to lead your House to victory!&#10;&#10;Some important links: The Official FAQ, the Unofficial FAQ, and an Automa (solo and 2p) Overview&#10;&#10;	\N	1	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/PhjygpWSo-0labGrPBMyyg__original/img/mZzaBAEEJpMlHWWmC0R6Su0OibQ=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5666597.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/PhjygpWSo-0labGrPBMyyg__thumb/img/JGgY-nBmkyB8WRp8vcoBLlNMQ5U=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5666597.jpg
9	291457	Gloomhaven: Jaws of the Lion	Gloomhaven: Jaws of the Lion is a standalone game that takes place before the events of Gloomhaven. The game includes four new characters &mdash; Valrath Red Guard (tank, crowd control), Inox Hatchet (ranged damage), Human Voidwarden (support, mind-control), and Quatryl Demolitionist (melee damage, obstacle manipulation) &mdash; that can also be used in the original Gloomhaven game.&#10;&#10;The game also includes 16 monster types (including seven new standard monsters and three new bosses) and a new campaign with 25 scenarios that invites the heroes to investigate a case of mysterious disappearances within the city. Is it the work of Vermlings, or is something far more sinister going on?&#10;&#10;Gloomhaven: Jaws of the Lion is aimed at a more casual audience to get people into the gameplay more quickly. All of the hard-to-organize cardboard map tiles have been removed, and instead players will play on the scenario book itself, which features new artwork unique to each scenario. The last barrier to entry &mdash; i.e., learning the game &mdash; has also been lowered through a simplified rule set and a five-scenario tutorial that will ease new players into the experience.&#10;&#10;	\N	1	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/_HhIdavYW-hid20Iq3hhmg__original/img/PBzsLRqNKQKJxGnzpb7o3qLWPQM=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5055631.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/_HhIdavYW-hid20Iq3hhmg__thumb/img/OMkN_E5eyWrkID_cHCnQEbIixGM=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5055631.jpg
10	115746	War of the Ring: Second Edition	In War of the Ring, one player takes control of the Free Peoples (FP), the other player controls Shadow Armies (SA). Initially, the Free People Nations are reluctant to take arms against Sauron, so they must be attacked by Sauron or persuaded by Gandalf or other Companions, before they start to fight properly: this is represented by the Political Track, which shows if a Nation is ready to fight in the War of the Ring or not.&#10;&#10;The game can be won by a military victory, if Sauron conquers a certain number of Free People cities and strongholds or vice versa. But the true hope of the Free Peoples lies with the quest of the Ringbearer: while the armies clash across Middle Earth, the Fellowship of the Ring is trying to get secretly to Mount Doom to destroy the One Ring. Sauron is not aware of the real intention of his enemies but is looking across Middle Earth for the precious Ring, so that the Fellowship is going to face numerous dangers, represented by the rules of The Hunt for the Ring. But the Companions can spur the Free Peoples to the fight against Sauron, so the Free People player must balance the need to protect the Ringbearer from harm, against the attempt to raise a proper defense against the armies of the Shadow, so that they do not overrun Middle Earth before the Ringbearer completes his quest.&#10;&#10;Each game turn revolves around the roll of Action Dice: each die corresponds to an action that a player can do during a turn. Depending on the face rolled on each die, different actions are possible (moving armies, characters, recruiting troops, advancing a Political Track).&#10;&#10;Action Dice can also be used to draw or play Event Cards. Event Cards are played to represent specific events from the story (or events that could possibly have happened) that cannot be portrayed through normal game-play. Each Event Card can also create an unexpected turn in the game, allowing special actions or altering the course of a battle.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ImPgGag98W6gpV1KV812aA__original/img/38jB7fN07DwlrGKYAf-J0vsNdgs=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1215633.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ImPgGag98W6gpV1KV812aA__thumb/img/X-lBBdG4uO6LT0y1vXxCN4jdR4M=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1215633.jpg
11	187645	Star Wars: Rebellion	Star Wars: Rebellion is a board game of epic conflict between the Galactic Empire and Rebel Alliance for two to four players.&#10;&#10;Experience the Galactic Civil War like never before. In Rebellion, you control the entire Galactic Empire or the fledgling Rebel Alliance. You must command starships, account for troop movements, and rally systems to your cause. Given the differences between the Empire and Rebel Alliance, each side has different win conditions, and you'll need to adjust your play style depending on who you represent:&#10;&#10;     As the Imperial player, you can command legions of Stormtroopers, swarms of TIEs, Star Destroyers, and even the Death Star. You rule the galaxy by fear, relying on the power of your massive military to enforce your will. To win the game, you need to snuff out the budding Rebel Alliance by finding its base and obliterating it. Along the way, you can subjugate worlds or even destroy them.&#10;     As the Rebel player, you can command dozens of troopers, T-47 airspeeders, Corellian corvettes, and fighter squadrons. However, these forces are no match for the Imperial military. In terms of raw strength, you'll find yourself clearly overmatched from the very outset, so you'll need to rally the planets to join your cause and execute targeted military strikes to sabotage Imperial build yards and steal valuable intelligence. To win the Galactic Civil War, you'll need to sway the galaxy's citizens to your cause. If you survive long enough and strengthen your reputation, you inspire the galaxy to a full-scale revolt, and you win.&#10;&#10;&#10;Featuring more than 150 plastic miniatures and two game boards that account for thirty-two of the Star Wars galaxy's most notable systems, Rebellion features a scope that is as large and sweeping as any Star Wars game before it.&#10;&#10;Yet for all its grandiosity, Rebellion remains intensely personal, cinematic, and heroic. As much as your success depends upon the strength of your starships, vehicles, and troops, it depends upon the individual efforts of such notable characters as Leia Organa, Mon Mothma, Grand Moff Tarkin, and Emperor Palpatine. As civil war spreads throughout the galaxy, these leaders are invaluable to your efforts, and the secret missions they attempt will evoke many of the most inspiring moments from the classic trilogy. You might send Luke Skywalker to receive Jedi training on Dagobah or have Darth Vader spring a trap that freezes Han Solo in carbonite!&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/7SrPNGBKg9IIsP4UQpOi8g__original/img/GKueTbkCk2Ramf6ai8mDj-BP6cI=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4325841.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/7SrPNGBKg9IIsP4UQpOi8g__thumb/img/gAxzddRVQiRdjZHYFUZ2xc5Jlbw=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4325841.jpg
12	162886	Spirit Island	In the most distant reaches of the world, magic still exists, embodied by spirits of the land, of the sky, and of every natural thing. As the great powers of Europe stretch their colonial empires further and further, they will inevitably lay claim to a place where spirits still hold power - and when they do, the land itself will fight back alongside the islanders who live there.&#10;&#10;Spirit Island is a complex and thematic cooperative game about defending your island home from colonizing Invaders. Players are different spirits of the land, each with its own unique elemental powers. Every turn, players simultaneously choose which of their power cards to play, paying energy to do so. Using combinations of power cards that match a spirit's elemental affinities can grant free bonus effects. Faster powers take effect immediately, before the Invaders spread and ravage, but other magics are slower, requiring forethought and planning to use effectively. In the Spirit phase, spirits gain energy, and choose how / whether to Grow: to reclaim used power cards, to seek for new power, or to spread presence into new areas of the island.&#10;&#10;The Invaders expand across the island map in a semi-predictable fashion. Each turn they explore into some lands (portions of the island); the next turn, they build in those lands, forming settlements and cities. The turn after that, they ravage there, bringing blight to the land and attacking any native islanders present. The islanders fight back against the Invaders when attacked, and lend the spirits some other aid, but may not always do so exactly as you'd hoped. Some Powers work through the islanders, helping them (eg) drive out the Invaders or clean the land of blight.&#10;&#10;The game escalates as it progresses: spirits spread their presence to new parts of the island and seek out new and more potent powers, while the Invaders step up their colonization efforts. Each turn represents 1-3 years of alternate-history. At game start, winning requires destroying every last settlement and city on the board - but as you frighten the Invaders more and more, victory becomes easier: they'll run away even if some number of settlements or cities remain. Defeat comes if any spirit is destroyed, if the island is overrun by blight, or if the Invader deck is depleted before achieving victory.&#10;&#10;The game includes different adversaries to fight against (eg: a Swedish Mining Colony, or a Remote British Colony). Each changes play in different ways, and offers a different path of difficulty boosts to keep the game challenging as you gain skill.&#10;&#10;	\N	1	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/kjCm4ZvPjIZxS-mYgSPy1g__original/img/9uLd9C3XAvInLCLhAoXqKVk56zs=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic7013651.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/kjCm4ZvPjIZxS-mYgSPy1g__thumb/img/aUlIih2_R7P8IYKeyNl2heLQbu8=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7013651.jpg
13	220308	Gaia Project	Gaia Project is a new game in the line of Terra Mystica. As in the original Terra Mystica, fourteen different factions live on seven different kinds of planets, and each faction is bound to their own home planets, so to develop and grow, they must terraform neighboring planets into their home environments in competition with the other groups. In addition, Gaia planets can be used by all factions for colonization, and Transdimensional planets can be changed into Gaia planets.&#10;&#10;All factions can improve their skills in six different areas of development &mdash; Terraforming, Navigation, Artificial Intelligence, Gaiaforming, Economy, Research &mdash; leading to advanced technology and special bonuses. To do all of that, each group has special skills and abilities.&#10;&#10;The playing area is made of ten sectors, allowing a variable set-up and thus an even bigger replay value than its predecessor Terra Mystica. A two-player game is hosted on seven sectors.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;	\N	1	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/hGWFm3hbMlCDsfCsauOQ4g__original/img/tjlflQtUPFiTpLpwk1NCVCS29Ic=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic5375625.png	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/hGWFm3hbMlCDsfCsauOQ4g__thumb/img/NNG7Ijyx4evp5gcVReis9i0koas=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5375625.png
14	12333	Twilight Struggle	&quot;Now the trumpet summons us again, not as a call to bear arms, though arms we need; not as a call to battle, though embattled we are &ndash; but a call to bear the burden of a long twilight struggle...&quot;&#10;&ndash; John F. Kennedy&#10;&#10;In 1945, unlikely allies toppled Hitler's war machine, while humanity's most devastating weapons forced the Japanese Empire to its knees in a storm of fire. Where once there stood many great powers, there then stood only two. The world had scant months to sigh its collective relief before a new conflict threatened. Unlike the titanic struggles of the preceding decades, this conflict would be waged not primarily by soldiers and tanks, but by spies and politicians, scientists and intellectuals, artists and traitors. Twilight Struggle is a two-player game simulating the forty-five year  dance of intrigue, prestige, and occasional flares of warfare between the Soviet Union and the United States. The entire world is the stage on which these two titans fight to make the world safe for their own ideologies and ways of life. The game begins amidst the ruins of Europe as the two new &quot;superpowers&quot; scramble over the wreckage of the Second World War, and ends in 1989, when only the United States remained standing.&#10;&#10;Twilight Struggle inherits its fundamental systems from the card-driven classics We the People and Hannibal: Rome vs. Carthage. It is a quick-playing, low-complexity game in that tradition. The game map is a world map of the period, whereon players move units and exert influence in attempts to gain allies and control for their superpower. As with GMT's other card-driven games, decision-making is a challenge; how to best use one's cards and units given consistently limited resources?&#10;&#10;Twilight Struggle's Event cards add detail and flavor to the game. They cover a vast array of historical happenings, from the Arab-Israeli conflicts of 1948 and 1967, to Vietnam and the U.S. peace movement, to the Cuban Missile Crisis and other such incidents that brought the world to the brink of nuclear annihilation. Subsystems capture the prestige-laden Space Race as well as nuclear tensions, with the possibility of game-ending nuclear war.&#10;&#10;Components (original edition):&#10;&#10;&#10;     228 full colour counters &#10;     22&quot;x34&quot; full colour map &#10;     103 event cards &#10;     2 six-sided dice&#10;     1 24-page rulebook&#10;     2 full colour player aid cards&#10;&#10;&#10;Components (2009 Deluxe edition and after)&#10;&#10;     260 full colour counters &#10;     22&quot;x34&quot; mounted map with revised graphics&#10;     110 event cards&#10;     2 six-sided dice&#10;     1 24-page rulebook&#10;     2 full colour player aid cards&#10;&#10;&#10;TIME SCALE:     approx. 3-5 years per turn&#10;MAP SCALE:     Point-to-point system&#10;UNIT SCALE:     Influence markers&#10;NUMBER OF PLAYERS:     2&#10;&#10;DESIGNER: Ananda Gupta &amp; Jason Matthews&#10;MAP, CARD, &amp; COUNTER ART: Mark Simonitch&#10;&#10;&#10;A deluxe edition, published in 2009 includes the following changes from the basic game:&#10;&#10;     Mounted map with revised graphics&#10;     Two double-thick counter sheets with 260 counters&#10;     Deck of 110 event cards (increased from 103)&#10;     Revised rules and player aid cards&#10;     Revised at start setup and text change for card #98 Aldrich Ames&#10;&#10;&#10;Upgrade kit for the owners of the previous version includes the following:&#10;&#10;     Mounted Map with revised graphics&#10;     New card decks&#10;     Updated Rules &amp; Charts&#10;&#10;&#10;	\N	2	2	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/pNCiUUphnoeWOYfsWq0kng__original/img/Iae47UtAd_RXVd5tJ3YzbDHOv4E=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3530661.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/pNCiUUphnoeWOYfsWq0kng__thumb/img/p7alNkNy8Avm8UISmhYHCiMz5bE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3530661.jpg
15	182028	Through the Ages: A New Story of Civilization	Through the Ages: A New Story of Civilization is the new edition of Through the Ages: A Story of Civilization, with many changes small and large to the game's cards over its three ages and extensive changes to how military works.&#10;&#10;Through the Ages is a civilization building game. Each player attempts to build the best civilization through careful resource management, discovering new technologies, electing the right leaders, building wonders and maintaining a strong military. Weakness in any area can be exploited by your opponents. The game takes place throughout the ages beginning in the age of antiquity and ending in the modern age.&#10;&#10;One of the primary mechanisms in TTA is card drafting. Technologies, wonders, and leaders come into play and become easier to draft the longer they are in play. In order to use a technology you will need enough science to discover it, enough food to create a population to man it and enough resources (ore) to build the building to use it. While balancing the resources needed to advance your technology you also need to build a military. Military is built in the same way as civilian buildings. Players that have a weak military will be preyed upon by other players. There is no map in the game so you cannot lose territory, but players with higher military will steal resources, science, kill leaders, take population or culture. It is very difficult to win with a large military, but it is very easy to lose because of a weak one.&#10;&#10;Victory is achieved by the player whose nation has the most culture at the end of the modern age.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/fVwPntkJKgaEo0rIC0RwpA__original/img/1jawNpljTXwnT4km_2CjGwoUPR8=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2663291.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/fVwPntkJKgaEo0rIC0RwpA__thumb/img/31usGlzlBReEFf60bcgbvDTjwCg=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2663291.jpg
16	193738	Great Western Trail	America in the 19th century: You are a rancher and repeatedly herd your cattle from Texas to Kansas City, where you send them off by train. This earns you money and victory points. Needless to say, each time you arrive in Kansas City, you want to have your most valuable cattle in tow. However, the &quot;Great Western Trail&quot; not only requires that you keep your herd in good shape, but also that you wisely use the various buildings along the trail. Also, it might be a good idea to hire capable staff: cowboys to improve your herd, craftsmen to build your very own buildings, or engineers for the important railroad line.&#10;&#10;If you cleverly manage your herd and navigate the opportunities and pitfalls of Great Western Trail, you surely will gain the most victory points and win the game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/u1l0gH7sb_vnvDvoO_QHqA__original/img/2zv_XMQoPFWk9Dn0oS4JY1IeFzw=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4887376.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/u1l0gH7sb_vnvDvoO_QHqA__thumb/img/9lxFidyDb8j6D1vobx4e3UwZ-FI=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4887376.jpg
17	84876	The Castles of Burgundy	The game is set in the Burgundy region of High Medieval France. Each player takes on the role of an aristocrat, originally controlling a small princedom. While playing they aim to build settlements and powerful castles, practice trade along the river, exploit silver mines, and use the knowledge of travelers.&#10;&#10;The game is about players taking settlement tiles from the game board and placing them into their princedom which is represented by the player board. Every tile has a function that starts when the tile is placed in the princedom. The princedom itself consists of several regions, each of which demands its own type of settlement tile.&#10;&#10;The game is played in five phases, each consisting of five rounds.  Each phase begins with the game board stocked with settlement tiles and goods tiles.  At the beginning of each round all players roll their two dice, and the player who is currently first in turn order rolls a goods placement die.  A goods tile is made available on the game board according to the roll of the goods die.  During each round players take their turns in the current turn order.  During his turn, a player may perform any two of the four possible types of actions: 1) take a settlement tile from the numbered depot on the game board corresponding to one of his dice and place it in the staging area on his player board, 2) take a settlement tile from the staging area of his player board to a space on his player board with a number matching one of his dice in the corresponding region for the type of tile and adjacent to a previously placed settlement tile, 3) deliver goods with a number matching one of his dice, or 4) take worker tokens which allow the player to adjust the roll of his dice.  In addition to these actions a player may buy a settlement tile from the central depot on the game board and place it in the staging area on his player board.  If an action triggers the award of victory points, those points are immediately recorded.  Each settlement tile offers a benefit, additional actions, additional money, advancement on the turn order track, more goods tiles, die roll adjustment or victory points.  Bonus victory points are awarded for filling a region with settlement tiles.&#10;&#10;The game ends after the fifth phase is played to completion.  Victory points are awarded for unused money and workers, and undelivered goods.  Bonus victory points from certain settlement tiles are awarded at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;The player with the most victory points wins.&#10;&#10;The rules include basic and advanced versions.&#10;&#10;This game is #14 in the Alea big box series.&#10;&#10;There is a separate BGG entry for the 2019 edition: The Castles of Burgundy.  The 2019 edition includes, alongside the base game, eight expansions, seven of which had already been released separately as promotional items and one new to the 2019 release.&#10;&#10;UPC 4005556812431&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/5CFwjd8zTcGYVUnkXh04hw__original/img/N8btACZrnEYK1amBNk26VBdcGwc=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1176894.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/5CFwjd8zTcGYVUnkXh04hw__thumb/img/0AG_6zsfYQjqlUHG0-_8lcjp8rc=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1176894.jpg
18	169786	Scythe	It is a time of unrest in 1920s Europa. The ashes from the first great war still darken the snow. The capitalistic city-state known simply as &ldquo;The Factory&rdquo;, which fueled the war with heavily armored mechs, has closed its doors, drawing the attention of several nearby countries.&#10;&#10;Scythe is an engine-building game set in an alternate-history 1920s period. It is a time of farming and war, broken hearts and rusted gears, innovation and valor. In Scythe, each player represents a character from one of five factions of Eastern Europe who are attempting to earn their fortune and claim their faction's stake in the land around the mysterious Factory. Players conquer territory, enlist new recruits, reap resources, gain villagers, build structures, and activate monstrous mechs.&#10;&#10;Each player begins the game with different resources (power, coins, combat acumen, and popularity), a different starting location, and a hidden goal. Starting positions are specially calibrated to contribute to each faction&rsquo;s uniqueness and the asymmetrical nature of the game (each faction always starts in the same place). Scythe uses a streamlined action-selection mechanism (no rounds or phases) to keep gameplay moving at a brisk pace and reduce downtime between turns. While there is plenty of direct conflict for players who seek it, there is no player elimination.&#10;&#10;Scythe gives players almost complete control over their fate. Other than each player&rsquo;s individual hidden objective card, the only elements of luck or variability are &ldquo;encounter&rdquo; cards that players will draw as they interact with the citizens of newly explored lands. Each encounter card provides the player with several options, allowing them to mitigate the luck of the draw through their selection. Combat is also driven by choices, not luck or randomness. Every part of Scythe has an aspect of engine-building to it. Players can upgrade actions to become more efficient, build structures that improve their position on the map, enlist new recruits to enhance character abilities, activate mechs to deter opponents from invading, and expand their borders to reap greater types and quantities of resources. These engine-building aspects create a sense of momentum and progress throughout the game. The order in which players improve their engine adds to the unique feel of each game, even when playing one faction multiple times.&#10;&#10;	\N	1	5	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/7k_nOxpO9OGIjhLq2BUZdA__original/img/HlDb9F365w0tSP8uD1vf1pfniQE=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3163924.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/7k_nOxpO9OGIjhLq2BUZdA__thumb/img/eQ69OEDdjYjfKg6q5Navee87skU=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3163924.jpg
19	173346	7 Wonders Duel	In many ways 7 Wonders Duel resembles its parent game 7 Wonders as over three ages players acquire cards that provide resources or advance their military or scientific development in order to develop a civilization and complete wonders.&#10;&#10;What's different about 7 Wonders Duel is that, as the title suggests, the game is solely for two players, with the players not drafting cards simultaneously from hands of cards, but from a display of face-down and face-up cards arranged at the start of a round. A player can take a card only if it's not covered by any others, so timing comes into play as well as bonus moves that allow you to take a second card immediately. As in the original game, each card that you acquire can be built, discarded for coins, or used to construct a wonder.&#10;&#10;Each player starts with four wonder cards, and the construction of a wonder provides its owner with a special ability. Only seven wonders can be built, though, so one player will end up short.&#10;&#10;Players can purchase resources at any time from the bank, or they can gain cards during the game that provide them with resources for future building; as you acquire resources, the cost for those particular resources increases for your opponent, representing your dominance in this area.&#10;&#10;A player can win 7 Wonders Duel in one of three ways: each time you acquire a military card, you advance the military marker toward your opponent's capital, giving you a bonus at certain positions; if you reach the opponent's capital, you win the game immediately; similarly, if you acquire any six of seven different scientific symbols, you achieve scientific dominance and win immediately; if none of these situations occurs, then the player with the most points at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	2	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/zdagMskTF7wJBPjX74XsRw__original/img/Ju836WNSaW7Mab9Vjq2TJ_FqhWQ=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2576399.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/zdagMskTF7wJBPjX74XsRw__thumb/img/gV1-ckZSIC-dCxxpq1Y7GmPITzQ=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2576399.jpg

You explore new star systems, research technologies, and build spaceships with which to wage war. There are many potential paths to victory, so you need to plan your strategy according to the strengths and weaknesses of your species, while paying attention to the other civilizations' endeavors.&#10;&#10;Eclipse: Second Dawn for the Galaxy is a revised and upgraded version of the Eclipse base game that debuted in 2011 that features:&#10;&#10;&#10;    New graphic design, while maintaining the acclaimed symbology of the first edition &#10;    A full line of Ship Pack 1 miniatures&#10;    New miniatures for ancients, GCDS, orbitals, and more&#10;    Custom plastic inlays&#10;    Custom combat dice&#10;    Fine-tuned gameplay&#10;&#10;&#10;	\N	2	6	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Oh3kHw6lweg6ru71Q16h2Q__original/img/yW7d4RNfU1ndISCaPlfGYUyxnRU=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5235277.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Oh3kHw6lweg6ru71Q16h2Q__thumb/img/e9XZdQe1ZcPpaq4Gy31OoWBB_V0=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5235277.jpg
21	28720	Brass: Lancashire	Brass: Lancashire &mdash; first published as Brass &mdash; is an economic strategy game that tells the story of competing cotton entrepreneurs in Lancashire during the industrial revolution. You must develop, build, and establish your industries and network so that you can capitalize demand for iron, coal and cotton. The game is played over two halves: the canal phase and the rail phase. To win the game, score the most victory points (VPs), which are counted at the end of each half. VPs are gained from your canals, rails, and established (flipped) industry tiles. Each round, players take turns according to the turn order track, receiving two actions to perform any of the following:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Build an industry tile&#10;    Build a rail or canal&#10;    Develop an industry&#10;    Sell cotton&#10;    Take a loan&#10;&#10;&#10;At the end of a player's turn, they replace the two cards they played with two more from the deck. Turn order is determined by how much money a player spent on the previous turn, from lowest spent first to highest spent. This turn order mechanism opens some strategic options for players going later in the turn order, allowing for the possibility of back-to-back turns.&#10;&#10;After all the cards have been played the first time (with the deck size being adjusted for the number of players), the canal phase ends and a scoring round commences. After scoring, all canals and all of the lowest level industries are removed for the game, after which new cards are dealt and the rail phase begins. During this phase, players may now occupy more than one location in a city and a double-connection build (though expensive) is possible. At the end of the rail phase, another scoring round takes place, then a winner is crowned.&#10;&#10;The cards limit where you can build your industries, but any card can be used for the develop, sell cotton or build connections actions. This leads to a strategic timing/storing of cards. Resources are common so that if one player builds a rail line (which requires coal) they have to use the coal from the nearest source, which may be an opponent's coal mine, which in turn gets that coal mine closer to scoring (i.e., being utilized).&#10;&#10;Brass: Lancashire, the 2018 edition from Roxley Games, reboots the original Warfrog Games edition of Brass with new artwork and components, as well as a few rules changes:&#10;&#10;&#10;     The virtual link rules between Birkenhead have been made optional.&#10;     The three-player experience has been brought closer to the ideal experience of four players by shortening each half of the game by one round and tuning the deck and distant market tiles slightly to ensure a consistent experience.&#10;     Two-player rules have been created and are playable without the need for an alternate board.&#10;     The level 1 cotton mill is now worth 5 VP to make it slightly less terrible.&#10;&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/tHVtPzu82mBpeQbbZkV6EA__original/img/3ffdJj5Pz6HQrg09Kh8ecTen-TY=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3469216.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/tHVtPzu82mBpeQbbZkV6EA__thumb/img/AghH1bAEhqzvyRcP3cy5G-rz0So=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3469216.jpg

22	167355	Nemesis	Playing Nemesis will take you into the heart of sci-fi survival horror in all its terror. A soldier fires blindly down a corridor, trying to stop the alien advance. A scientist races to find a solution in his makeshift lab. A traitor steals the last escape pod in the very last moment. Intruders you meet on the ship are not only reacting to the noise you make but also evolve as the time goes by. The longer the game takes, the stronger they become. During the game, you control one of the crew members with a unique set of skills, personal deck of cards, and individual starting equipment. These heroes cover all your basic SF horror needs. For example, the scientist is great with computers and research, but will have a hard time in combat. The soldier, on the other hand...&#10;&#10;Nemesis is a semi-cooperative game in which you and your crewmates must survive on a ship infested with hostile organisms. To win the game, you have to complete one of the two objectives dealt to you at the start of the game and get back to Earth in one piece. You will find many obstacles on your way: swarms of Intruders (the name given to the alien organisms by the ship AI), the poor physical condition of the ship, agendas held by your fellow players, and sometimes just cruel fate.&#10;&#10;The gameplay of Nemesis is designed to be full of climactic moments which, hopefully, you will find rewarding even when your best plans are ruined and your character meets a terrible fate.&#10;&#10;	\N	1	5	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/tAqLpWxQ0Oo3GaPP3MER1g__original/img/sA6r1p6BO_Tgyc3-xgIESC9Y-vg=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5073276.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/tAqLpWxQ0Oo3GaPP3MER1g__thumb/img/sMIg7_b5ekS1xm6cBIoMFpH0MZs=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5073276.jpg

24	177736	A Feast for Odin	A Feast for Odin is a saga in the form of a board game. You are reliving the cultural achievements, mercantile expeditions, and pillages of those tribes we know as Viking today &mdash; a term that was used quite differently towards the end of the first millennium.&#10;&#10;When the northerners went out for a raid, they used to say they headed out for a viking. Their Scandinavian ancestors, however, were much more than just pirates. They were explorers and founders of states. Leif Eriksson is said to be the first European in America, long before Columbus.&#10;In what is known today as Normandy, the intruders were not called Vikings but Normans. One of them is the famous William the Conqueror who invaded England in 1066. He managed to do what the king of Norway failed to do only a few years prior: conquer the Throne of England. The reason why the people of these times became such strong seafarers is due to their unfortunate agricultural situation. Crop shortfalls caused great distress.&#10;&#10;In this game, you will raid and explore new territories. You will also experience their day-to-day activities: collecting goods to achieve a financially secure position in society. In the end, the player whose possessions bear the greatest value will be declared the winner.&#10;&#10;--gameplay description from @StoryBoardGamer's review:&#10;A Feast for Odin is a points-driven game, with plethora of pathways to victory, with a range of risk balanced against reward. A significant portion of this is your central hall, which has a whopping -86 points of squares and a major part of your game is attempting to cover these up with various tiles. Likewise, long halls and island colonies can also offer large rewards, but they will have penalties of their own.&#10;&#10;Each year follows a familiar pattern of preparation, worker placement, and then meeting the requirements of your feast. The main phase of each year is a worker placement affair. You start with a selection of Vikings, and a large action board with a whopping 61 different options to choose from. Each of these will be arranged from left to right in one of four columns. Each column requires an additional Viking to activate, but they are proportionally more powerful.&#10;&#10;At the end of each round, you will need to fill a feast table with food, alternating between plants and vegetable matter. You will also have a chance to lay the valuable green and blue tiles into your main hall. The configuration of these tiles must follow certain requirements, but your main goal is to both cover up a line of coin icons to increase your income, while otherwise encircling certain printed icons to generate those.&#10;&#10;You will build your engine over time, following an alternating pattern of outward expansion and hunting against development and cultivation. It all comes down to how much you&rsquo;re willing to take on at any one time, and what risks you&rsquo;re willing to set yourself up with for their rewards.&#10;&#10;UPC 681706716909&#10;&#10;	\N	1	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/s9oGMCo1fcfV4Dk3EnqLZw__original/img/N1X-0JB1GapFVhl98nP4tNFXMcM=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic3146943.png	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/s9oGMCo1fcfV4Dk3EnqLZw__thumb/img/AKxMMz2DTbBrEynhDROla8fdjJ4=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3146943.png
25	124361	Concordia	Two thousand years ago, the Roman Empire ruled the lands around the Mediterranean Sea. With peace at the borders, harmony inside the provinces, uniform law, and a common currency, the economy thrived and gave rise to mighty Roman dynasties as they expanded throughout the numerous cities. Guide one of these dynasties and send colonists to the remote realms of the Empire; develop your trade network; and appease the ancient gods for their favor &mdash; all to gain the chance to emerge victorious!&#10;&#10;Concordia is a peaceful strategy game of economic development in Roman times for 2-5 players aged 13 and up. Instead of looking to the luck of dice or cards, players must rely on their strategic abilities. Be sure to watch your rivals to determine which goals they are pursuing and where you can outpace them! In the game, colonists are sent out from Rome to settle down in cities that produce bricks, food, tools, wine, and cloth. Each player starts with an identical set of playing cards and acquires more cards during the game. These cards serve two purposes:&#10;&#10;&#10;    They allow a player to choose actions during the game.&#10;    They are worth victory points (VPs) at the end of the game. &#10;&#10;&#10;Concordia is a strategy game that requires advance planning and consideration of your opponent's moves. Every game is different, not only because of the sequence of new cards on sale but also due to the modular layout of cities. (One side of the game board shows the entire Roman Empire with 30 cities for 3-5 players, while the other shows Roman Italy with 25 cities for 2-4 players.) When all cards have been sold or after the first player builds his 15th house, the game ends. The player with the most VPs from the gods (Jupiter, Saturnus, Mercurius, Minerva, Vesta, etc.) wins the game.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	5	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/CzwSm8i7tkLz6cBnrILZBg__original/img/BhJ3sB3uk-eSdR1iW4EP3cu0Wi0=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3453267.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/CzwSm8i7tkLz6cBnrILZBg__thumb/img/ESPSltYYSFK-aJw6jOTdQrJGpOc=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3453267.jpg

27	120677	Terra Mystica	In the land of Terra Mystica dwell 14 different peoples in seven landscapes, and each group is bound to its own home environment, so to develop and grow, they must terraform neighboring landscapes into their home environments in competition with the other groups.&#10;&#10;Terra Mystica is a full information game, without any luck, that rewards strategic planning. Each player governs one of the 14 groups. With subtlety and craft, the player must attempt to rule as great an area as possible and to develop that group's skills. There are also four religious cults in which you can progress. To do all that, each group has special skills and abilities.&#10;&#10;Taking turns, the players execute their actions on the resources they have at their disposal. Different buildings allow players to develop different resources. Dwellings allow for more workers. Trading houses allow players to make money. Strongholds unlock a group's special ability, and temples allow you to develop religion and your terraforming and seafaring skills. Buildings can be upgraded: Dwellings can be developed into trading houses; trading houses can be developed into strongholds or temples; one temple can be upgraded to become a sanctuary. Each group must also develop its terraforming skill and its skill with boats to use the rivers. The groups in question, along with their home landscape, are:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Desert (Fakirs, Nomads)&#10;    Plains (Halflings, Cultists)&#10;    Swamp (Alchemists, Darklings)&#10;    Lake (Mermaids, Swarmlings)&#10;    Forest (Witches, Auren)&#10;    Mountain (Dwarves, Engineers)&#10;    Wasteland (Giants, Chaos Magicians)&#10;&#10;&#10;Proximity to other groups is a double-edged sword in Terra Mystica. Being close to other groups gives you extra power, but it also means that expanding is more difficult...&#10;&#10;Terra Mystica FAQ&#10;&#10;	\N	2	5	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/bre12I1YiXkZr7elvriz4A__original/img/_dZS7fVfdc4DhJPbqnDpwTT4uF0=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5375624.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/bre12I1YiXkZr7elvriz4A__thumb/img/GW-ip0dfeAee7KQqJ04SRZxF1lg=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5375624.jpg

28	205637	Arkham Horror: The Card Game	Something evil stirs in Arkham, and only you can stop it. Blurring the traditional lines between role-playing and card game experiences, Arkham Horror: The Card Game is a Living Card Game of Lovecraftian mystery, monsters, and madness!&#10;&#10;In the game, you and your friend (or up to three friends with two Core Sets) become characters within the quiet New England town of Arkham. You have your talents, sure, but you also have your flaws. Perhaps you've dabbled a little too much in the writings of the Necronomicon, and its words continue to haunt you. Perhaps you feel compelled to cover up any signs of otherworldly evils, hampering your own investigations in order to protect the quiet confidence of the greater population. Perhaps you'll be scarred by your encounters with a ghoulish cult.&#10;&#10;No matter what compels you, no matter what haunts you, you'll find both your strengths and weaknesses reflected in your custom deck of cards, and these cards will be your resources as you work with your friends to unravel the world's most terrifying mysteries.&#10;&#10;Each of your adventures in Arkham Horror LCG carries you deeper into mystery. You'll find cultists and foul rituals. You'll find haunted houses and strange creatures. And you may find signs of the Ancient Ones straining against the barriers to our world...&#10;&#10;The basic mode of play in Arkham LCG is not the adventure, but the campaign. You might be scarred by your adventures, your sanity may be strained, and you may alter Arkham's landscape, burning buildings to the ground. All your choices and actions have consequences that reach far beyond the immediate resolution of the scenario at hand&mdash;and your actions may earn you valuable experience with which you can better prepare yourself for the adventures that still lie before you.&#10;&#10;	\N	1	2	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/B5F5ulz0UivNgrI9Ky0euA__original/img/guEKCewM_2e5ugltSN3dTSwdZJI=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3122349.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/B5F5ulz0UivNgrI9Ky0euA__thumb/img/L8ouPl5jv2Ye9MC4R_Os2zSGigE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3122349.jpg
29	312484	Lost Ruins of Arnak	On an uninhabited island in uncharted seas, explorers have found traces of a great civilization. Now you will lead an expedition to explore the island, find lost artifacts, and face fearsome guardians, all in a quest to learn the island's secrets.&#10;&#10;Lost Ruins of Arnak combines deck-building and worker placement in a game of exploration, resource management, and discovery. In addition to traditional deck-builder effects, cards can also be used to place workers, and new worker actions become available as players explore the island. Some of these actions require resources instead of workers, so building a solid resource base will be essential. You are limited to only one action per turn, so make your choice carefully... what action will benefit you most now? And what can you afford to do later... assuming someone else doesn't take the action first!?&#10;&#10;Decks are small, and randomness in the game is heavily mitigated by the wealth of tactical decisions offered on the game board. With a variety of worker actions, artifacts, and equipment cards, the set-up for each game will be unique, encouraging players to explore new strategies to meet the challenge.&#10;&#10;Discover the Lost Ruins of Arnak!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;	\N	1	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/6GqH14TJJhza86BX5HCLEQ__original/img/CXqwimJPonWy1oyXEMgPN_ZVmUI=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5674958.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/6GqH14TJJhza86BX5HCLEQ__thumb/img/J8SVmGOJXZGxNjkT3xYNQU7Haxg=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5674958.jpg
30	237182	Root	Root is a game of adventure and war in which 2 to 4 (1 to 6 with the 'Riverfolk' expansion) players battle for control of a vast wilderness. Like Vast: The Crystal Caverns, each player in Root has unique capabilities and a different victory condition. Now, with the aid of gorgeous, multi-use cards, a truly asymmetric design has never been more accessible.&#10;&#10;The nefarious Marquise de Cat has seized the great woodland, intent on harvesting its riches. Under her rule, the many creatures of the forest have banded together. This Alliance will seek to strengthen its resources and subvert the rule of Cats. In this effort, the Alliance may enlist the help of the wandering Vagabonds who are able to move through the more dangerous woodland paths. Though some may sympathize with the Alliance&rsquo;s hopes and dreams, these wanderers are old enough to remember the great birds of prey who once controlled the woods.&#10;&#10;Meanwhile, at the edge of the region, the proud, squabbling Eyrie have found a new commander who they hope will lead their faction to resume their ancient birthright. The stage is set for a contest that will decide the fate of the great woodland. It is up to the players to decide which group will ultimately take root.&#10;&#10;In Root, players drive the narrative, and the differences between each role create an unparalleled level of interaction and replayability.

533	111341	The Great Zimbabwe	The Great Zimbabwe is a game about building a trade based civilization in ancient Africa. It has been inspired by the old kingdoms surrounding the Great Zimbabwe, a world heritage site in southern Africa. Far into the previous century, colonial governments denied that a civilization that produced such impressive monuments and beautiful artwork could have been African in origin. But of course, this civilization was African, and the country of Zimbabwe itself was proudly named after this impressive cultural heritage. As always in our games, we have used this history for inspiration; however, first and foremost we wanted to create a highly playable and replayable Splotter game, so in many cases we took liberties with historical names, periods and artwork.&#10;&#10;In the game, players strive to build the most impressive monuments to one god of their choice. They can choose this god themselves-- each of the twelve gods offers a unique blessing, but each also requires a different amount of work to win the game. Building the monuments is done by developing a logistics network stretching across the region. Through this network, players produce and obtain ritual goods to raise their monuments and bring honour to the god of their choice.&#10;&#10;Here's the flavour text from the rules:&#10;&#10;The Mutapa king struts into the village, followed by a bunch of young warriors herding cattle. &ldquo;Oondabezitha &rdquo;, he addresses the assembly of kings, &ldquo;I have brought twelve heads of cattle for the ceremony tonight&rdquo;. The others seem to shrink in stature as he speaks. The star of the king of Mutapa is clearly ascending. They have not brought nearly as much cattle themselves. &ldquo;Soon, we will all be praying to Obatala&rdquo;, murmurs one of the older Kilwa traders. &ldquo;The Mutapa will be raising their godless monuments sky-high. Perhaps it is time for us to resort to some magic of our own&rdquo;. Then the sky breaks into a thunder and a torrential rain pours down on the assembly. The men scramble while the plains fill with water. The ceremony will be wet tonight...&#10;&#10;&#10;The Great Zimbabwe is a logistico-economic game in which players are tribal leaders in Africa trying to please the gods by building monuments.&#10;&#10;Buying technology, building craftsmen, gathering resources and worshipping a god are among the many decisions necessary to win in 'The Great Zimbabwe'. But the main way of getting there is building and developing a network of monuments. The higher the monuments, the closer the players will be to victory, but players must balance many subtle aspects of the game. If they develop their economy, if they worship a powerful god or if they use a lot of technology, they will need to score more victory points.&#10;&#10;Clever use of turn-order manipulation, economic development in an almost close environment, scarce natural resource use and logistical optimization to deliver goods from craftsmen to monuments: You only get one action per turn, so be smart! 'The Great Zimbabwe' is a race for victory, in which you decide how far you want to go and at what speed. Then other players' decisions change everything...&#10;&#10;	\N	2	5	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/KoL5aL8f_OpyzB9yYSI8VA__original/img/gtQ1AZ8xqbjEq9KhLK6aoz9TQm8=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1400856.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/KoL5aL8f_OpyzB9yYSI8VA__thumb/img/tGLIa6i13UQJv2-Xj47XEHZrDRg=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1400856.jpg
33	199792	Everdell	Within the charming valley of Everdell, beneath the boughs of towering trees, among meandering streams and mossy hollows, a civilization of forest critters is thriving and expanding. From Everfrost to Bellsong, many a year have come and gone, but the time has come for new territories to be settled and new cities established. You will be the leader of a group of critters intent on just such a task. There are buildings to construct, lively characters to meet, events to host&mdash;you have a busy year ahead of yourself. Will the sun shine brightest on your city before the winter moon rises?&#10;&#10;Everdell is a game of dynamic tableau building and worker placement.&#10;&#10;On their turn a player can take one of three actions:&#10;&#10;a) Place a Worker: Each player has a collection of Worker pieces. These are placed on the board locations, events, and on Destination cards. Workers perform various actions to further the development of a player's tableau: gathering resources, drawing cards, and taking other special actions.&#10;&#10;b) Play a Card: Each player is building and populating a city; a tableau of up to 15 Construction and Critter cards. There are five types of cards: Travelers, Production, Destination, Governance, and Prosperity. Cards generate resources (twigs, resin, pebbles, and berries), grant abilities, and ultimately score points. The interactions of the cards reveal numerous strategies and a near infinite variety of working cities.&#10;&#10;c) Prepare for the next Season: Workers are returned to the players supply and new workers are added. The game is played from Winter through to the onset of the following winter, at which point the player with the city with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;	\N	1	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/fjE7V5LNq31yVEW_yuqI-Q__original/img/HQ1ti16wT9lqja5_h3gUfHUIcVI=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic3918905.png	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/fjE7V5LNq31yVEW_yuqI-Q__thumb/img/Cf_mYxR_VvdjTEPXseSurni2JNI=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3918905.png

35	183394	Viticulture Essential Edition	In Viticulture, the players find themselves in the roles of people in rustic, pre-modern Tuscany who have inherited meager vineyards. They have a few plots of land, an old crushpad, a tiny cellar, and three workers. They each have a dream of being the first to call their winery a true success.&#10;&#10;The players are in the position of determining how they want to allocate their workers throughout the year. Every season is different on a vineyard, so the workers have different tasks they can take care of in the summer and winter. There's competition over those tasks, and often the first worker to get to the job has an advantage over subsequent workers.&#10;&#10;Fortunately for the vineyard owners, people love to visit wineries, and it just so happens that many of those visitors are willing to help out around the vineyard when they visit as long as you assign a worker to take care of them. Their visits (in the form of cards) are brief but can be very helpful.&#10;&#10;Using those workers and visitors, the vineyard owners can expand their vineyards by building structures, planting vines, and filling wine orders, working towards the goal of running the most successful winery in Tuscany.&#10;&#10;Viticulture Essential Edition includes the base game of Viticulture and a few of the most popular modules from the original Tuscany expansion, including Mamas &amp; Papas, Fields (previously known as Properties), expanded and revised Visitors, and Automa cards for a solo variant, along with a few minor rule changes.&#10;&#10;	\N	1	6	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/l_PRU2lVlX9seScRFcvFlA__original/img/gDL7OZFlzoOFgU0VYlREs8P5hCQ=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic6500949.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/l_PRU2lVlX9seScRFcvFlA__thumb/img/pULDtVd75QZgGfvSMhr6Rs07vK8=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6500949.jpg
36	251247	Barrage	In the dystopic 1930s, the industrial revolution pushed the exploitation of fossil-based resources to the limit, and now the only thing powerful enough to quench the thirst for power of the massive machines and of the unstoppable engineering progress is the unlimited hydroelectric energy provided by the rivers.&#10;&#10;Barrage is a resource management strategic game in which players compete to build their majestic dams, raise them to increase their storing capacity, and deliver all the potential power through pressure tunnels connected to the energy turbines of their powerhouses.&#10;&#10;Each player represents one of the four international companies who are gathering machinery, innovative patents and brilliant engineers to claim the best locations to collect and exploit the water of a contested Alpine region crossed by rivers.&#10;&#10;Barrage includes two innovative and challenging mechanisms. First, the players must carefully plan their actions and handle their machinery, since both their action tokens and resources are stored on a Construction Wheel and will only be available after a full turn of the wheel. The better you manage your wheel, the earlier your resources and actions come back to you.&#10;&#10;Second, the water flow on the rivers depicted on the board is a shared and contested resource. Players have to intercept and store as much of the water as they can, build dams (upstream dams are expensive but can block part of the water before it reaches the downstream dams), raise the dams to increase their capacity, and build long tunnels to channel the water to their powerhouses. Water is never consumed &mdash; its flow is just used to produce energy &mdash;, it is instead released back to the rivers, so you have to strategically place your dams to recover the water diverted by you and the other players.&#10;&#10;Over five rounds, the players must fulfill power requirements represented by a common competitive power track and meet specific requests of personal contracts. At the same time, by placing a limited number of engineers, they attempt to enhance their machinery to acquire new and more efficient construction actions and to build and activate special unique-effect buildings to forward their own developing strategy.&#10;&#10;	\N	1	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/jEPmWvvYpqkWrKOzqIHFsg__original/img/rkHKwkUqpQC7PAGG7n2gbrcQiUY=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic4336469.png	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/jEPmWvvYpqkWrKOzqIHFsg__thumb/img/kMLIpeqA6UcUvQg2AdMwwQoEIfU=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4336469.png
37	324856	The Crew: Mission Deep Sea	In the trick-taking card game The Crew: Mission Deep Sea, you and the other players work together to search for the lost continent of Mu. This new adventure takes your crew deep down into the abyss on a search for the fabled sunken land. How far you get depends entirely on how well you work together as a team. Card by card, trick by trick, your search party will discover the challenges that lie ahead and forge a path to Mu.&#10;&#10;This new version of The Crew has the same innovative co-operative trick-taking mechanism as the highly lauded original game &mdash; but with some exciting new surprises! While communication between your crew members is severely limited by your submerged state, it is also critical to your success; finding the hidden land in the murky depths depends not only on winning tricks, but also on carefully negotiating the order in which they are won. If things don't go as planned, you might just be able to salvage the operation, but it will take near flawless execution and perhaps a little luck to finally reach Mu.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;	\N	2	5	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/VuBqZ1sMaDAVVHF_OEJP4g__original/img/jGWxczXC_VWZofeAmlO_DkB0hCI=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5988903.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/VuBqZ1sMaDAVVHF_OEJP4g__thumb/img/EdacXlcFZ06YK0-ZKa0oKwL4VCw=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5988903.jpg
40	256960	Pax Pamir: Second Edition	In Pax Pamir, players assume the role of nineteenth century Afghan leaders attempting to forge a new state after the collapse of the Durrani Empire. Western histories often call this period &quot;The Great Game&quot; because of the role played by the Europeans who attempted to use central Asia as a theater for their own rivalries. In this game, those empires are viewed strictly from the perspective of the Afghans who sought to manipulate the interloping ferengi (foreigners) for their own purposes.&#10;&#10;In terms of game play, Pax Pamir is a pretty straightforward tableau builder. Players spend most of their turns purchasing cards from a central market, then playing those cards in front of them in a single row called a court. Playing cards adds units to the game's map and grants access to additional actions that can be taken to disrupt other players and influence the course of the game. That last point is worth emphasizing. Though everyone is building their own row of cards, the game offers many ways for players to interfere with each other directly and indirectly.&#10;&#10;To survive, players will organize into coalitions. Throughout the game, the dominance of the different coalitions will be evaluated by the players when a special card, called a &quot;Dominance Check&quot;, is resolved. If a single coalition has a commanding lead during one of these checks, those players loyal to that coalition will receive victory points based on their influence in their coalition. However, if Afghanistan remains fragmented during one of these checks, players instead will receive victory points based on their personal power base.&#10;&#10;After each Dominance Check, victory is checked and the game will be partially reset, offering players a fresh attempt to realize their ambitions. The game ends when a single player is able to achieve a lead of four or more victory points  or after the fourth and final Dominance Check is resolved.&#10;&#10;	\N	1	5	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/oSM_AuKYfGIwOtKbVEsoVg__original/img/7DlaMCmuoJzm9AzelmStYIDgutI=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic4503733.png	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/oSM_AuKYfGIwOtKbVEsoVg__thumb/img/NyoufH5YBFCh1rKy4uy76bR4ITk=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4503733.png

42	247763	Underwater Cities	In Underwater Cities, which takes about 30-45 minutes per player, players represent the most powerful brains in the world, brains nominated due to the overpopulation of Earth to establish the best and most livable underwater areas possible.&#10;&#10;The main principle of the game is card placement. Three colored cards are placed along the edge of the main board  into 3 x 5 slots, which are also colored. Ideally players can place cards into slots of the same color. Then they can take both actions and advantages: the action depicted in the slot on the main board and also the advantage of the card. Actions and advantages can allow players to intake raw materials; to build and upgrade city domes, tunnels and production buildings such as farms, desalination devices and laboratories in their personal underwater area; to move their marker on the initiative track (which is important for player order in the next turn); to activate the player's &quot;A-cards&quot;; and to collect cards, both special ones and basic ones that allow for better decision possibilities during gameplay.&#10;&#10;All of the nearly 220 cards &mdash; whether special or basic &mdash; are divided into five types according to the way and time of use. Underwater areas are planned to be double-sided, giving players many opportunities to achieve VPs and finally win.&#10;&#10;	\N	1	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/PwOwTVHovJAUQgghnGqCOg__original/img/1WL5-4DZi0hX76HEgsLIYRRaIh4=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic4837710.png	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/PwOwTVHovJAUQgghnGqCOg__thumb/img/1gGYiRBx7W4wyLy826EHGTdjsKA=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4837710.png
43	3076	Puerto Rico	In Puerto Rico, players assume the roles of colonial governors on the island of Puerto Rico. The aim of the game is to amass victory points by shipping goods to Europe or by constructing buildings.&#10;&#10;Each player uses a separate small board with spaces for city buildings, plantations, and resources. Shared between the players are three ships, a trading house, and a supply of resources and doubloons.&#10;&#10;The resource cycle of the game is that players grow crops which they exchange for points or doubloons. Doubloons can then be used to buy buildings, which allow players to produce more crops or give them other abilities. Buildings and plantations do not work unless they are manned by colonists.&#10;&#10;During each round, players take turns selecting a role card from those on the table (such as &quot;Trader&quot; or &quot;Builder&quot;). When a role is chosen, every player gets to take the action appropriate to that role. The player that selected the role also receives a small privilege for doing so - for example, choosing the &quot;Builder&quot; role allows all players to construct a building, but the player who chose the role may do so at a discount on that turn. Unused roles gain a doubloon bonus at the end of each turn, so the next player who chooses that role gets to keep any doubloon bonus associated with it. This encourages players to make use of all the roles throughout a typical course of a game.&#10;&#10;Puerto Rico uses a variable phase order mechanism in which a &quot;governor&quot; token is passed clockwise to the next player at the conclusion of a turn. The player with the token begins the round by choosing a role and taking the first action.&#10;&#10;Players earn victory points for owning buildings, for shipping goods, and for manned &quot;large buildings.&quot; Each player's accumulated shipping chips are kept face down and come in denominations of one or five. This prevents other players from being able to determine the exact score of another player. Goods and doubloons are placed in clear view of other players and the totals of each can always be requested by a player. As the game enters its later stages, the unknown quantity of shipping tokens and its denominations require players to consider their options before choosing a role that can end the game.&#10;&#10;In 2011 and mostly afterwards, Puerto Rico was published to include both Puerto Rico: Expansion I &ndash; New Buildings and Puerto Rico: Expansion II &ndash; The Nobles. These versions are included in the other game entry Puerto Rico, not this regular game entry for Puerto Rico. Some editions of Puerto Rico list the player count as 2-5 instead of 3-5, and they include variant rules for games with only two players.&#10;&#10;	\N	3	5	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/QFiIRd2kimaMqTyWsX0aUg__original/img/DOgIp57F7tKZvxeITGAd3e_Q9as=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic158548.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/QFiIRd2kimaMqTyWsX0aUg__thumb/img/5fLo89ChZH6Wzukk36bhZ-EpBS0=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic158548.jpg
67	284083	The Crew: The Quest for Planet Nine	In the co-operative trick-taking game The Crew: The Quest for Planet Nine, the players set out as astronauts on an uncertain space adventure. What are the rumors regarding the unknown planet about? The eventful journey through space extends over 50 exciting missions. But this game can only be defeated by meeting common individual tasks of each player. In order to meet the varied challenges communication is essential in the team. But this is more difficult than expected in space.&#10;&#10;With each mission the game becomes more difficult. After each mission the game can be paused and continued later. During each mission it is not the number of tricks but the right tricks at the right time that count.&#10;&#10;The team completes a mission only if every single player is successful in fulfilling their tasks.&#10;&#10;The game comes with 50 missions, with three additional missions published in spielbox 2/2020.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	5	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/98LnQShydr11OBKS46xY-Q__original/img/Q-ZkgnuBu9OTBr7J3qnqPjqamAE=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5687013.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/98LnQShydr11OBKS46xY-Q__thumb/img/et-fnuozyOdBOVL-5kSS3_7I8fw=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5687013.jpg
44	295770	Frosthaven	Frosthaven is the story of a small outpost far to the north of the capital city of White Oak, an outpost barely surviving the harsh weather as well as invasions from forces both known and unknown. There, a group of mercenaries at the end of their rope will help bring back this settlement from the edge of destruction. Not only will they have to deal with the harsh elements, but there are other, far more dangerous threats out in the unforgiving cold as well. There are Algox, the bigger, more yeti-like cousins of the Inox, attacking from the mountains; Lurkers flooding in from the northern sea; and rumors of machines that wander the frozen wastes of their own free will. The party of mercenaries must face all of these perils, and perhaps in doing so, make peace with these new races so they can work together against even more sinister forces.&#10;&#10;Frosthaven is a standalone adventure from the designer and publisher of Gloomhaven that features sixteen new characters, three new races, more than twenty new enemies, more than one hundred new items, and a new, 100-scenario campaign.  Characters and items from Gloomhaven will be usable in Frosthaven, and vice versa.&#10;&#10;In addition to having the well-known combat mechanisms of Gloomhaven, Frosthaven will feature much more to do outside of combat, such as numerous mysteries to solve, a seasonal event system to live through, and player control over how this ramshackle village expands, with each new building offering new ways to progress.&#10;&#10;Frosthaven has a whole new set of items but there is a mechanic for bringing items over from 'Gloomhaven'. However, as it is a remote location, these products get imported and are not there as standard. Resources are much more valuable and you have to build items through a crafting system rather than just buy them.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;	\N	1	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/iEBr5o8AbJi9V9cgQcYROQ__original/img/ZNt6bSM6kCGFzN1_mzuPl4wCbyM=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic6177719.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/iEBr5o8AbJi9V9cgQcYROQ__thumb/img/a_VDlLgE8s8bfaQKwHlHu2KoQwo=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6177719.jpg
45	102794	Caverna: The Cave Farmers	Following along the same lines as its predecessor (Agricola), Caverna: The Cave Farmers is a worker-placement game at heart, with a focus on farming. In the game, you are the bearded leader of a small dwarf family that lives in a little cave in the mountains. You begin the game with a farmer and his spouse, and each member of the farming family represents an action that the player can take each turn. Together, you cultivate the forest in front of your cave and dig deeper into the mountain. You furnish the caves as dwellings for your offspring as well as working spaces for small enterprises.&#10;&#10;It's up to you how much ore you want to mine. You will need it to forge weapons that allow you to go on expeditions to gain bonus items and actions. While digging through the mountain, you may come across water sources and find ore and ruby mines that help you increase your wealth. Right in front of your cave, you can increase your wealth even further with agriculture: You can cut down the forest to sow fields and fence in pastures to hold your animals. You can also expand your family while running your ever-growing farm. In the end, the player with the most efficiently developed home board wins.&#10;&#10;You can also play the solo variant of this game to familiarize yourself with the 48 different furnishing tiles for your cave.&#10;&#10;Caverna: The Cave Farmers, which has a playing time of roughly 30 minutes per player, is a complete redesign of Agricola that substitutes the card decks from the former game with a set of buildings while adding the ability to purchase weapons and send your farmers on quests to gain further resources. Designer Uwe Rosenberg says that the game includes parts of Agricola, but also has new ideas, especially the cave part of your game board, where you can build mines and search for rubies. The game also includes two new animals: dogs and donkeys.&#10;&#10;	\N	1	7	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/rz22tqa5PCYvK9oDjIbvxg__original/img/h9il8XnFB0iqHNHsNTPNGxJZWdM=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1790789.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/rz22tqa5PCYvK9oDjIbvxg__thumb/img/3Ae-ieYpDv6w0vuNsGjOmXdcCrU=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1790789.jpg
46	170216	Blood Rage	&quot;Life is Battle; Battle is Glory; Glory is ALL&quot;&#10;&#10;In Blood Rage, each player controls their own Viking clan&rsquo;s warriors, leader, and ship. Ragnar&ouml;k has come, and it&rsquo;s the end of the world! It&rsquo;s the Vikings&rsquo; last chance to go down in a blaze of glory and secure their place in Valhalla at Odin&rsquo;s side! For a Viking there are many pathways to glory. You can invade and pillage the land for its rewards, crush your opponents in epic battles, fulfill quests, increase your clan's stats, or even die gloriously either in battle or from Ragnar&ouml;k, the ultimate inescapable doom.&#10;&#10;Most player strategies are guided by the cards drafted at the beginning of each of the three game rounds (or Ages). These &ldquo;Gods&rsquo; Gifts&rdquo; grant you numerous boons for your clan including: increased Viking strength and devious battle strategies, upgrades to your clan, or even the aid of legendary creatures from Norse mythology. They may also include various quests, from dominating specific provinces, to having lots of your Vikings sent to Valhalla. Most of these cards are aligned with one of the Norse gods, hinting at the kind of strategy they support. For example, Thor gives more glory for victory in battle, Heimdall grants you foresight and surprises, Tyr strengthens you in battle, while the trickster Loki actually rewards you for losing battles, or punishes the winner.&#10;&#10;Players must choose their strategies carefully during the draft phase, but also be ready to adapt and react to their opponents&rsquo; strategies as the action phase unfolds. Battles are decided not only by the strength of the figures involved, but also by cards played in secret. By observing your opponent&rsquo;s actions and allegiances to specific gods, you may predict what card they are likely to play, and plan accordingly. Winning battles is not always the best course of action, as the right card can get you even more rewards by being crushed. The only losing strategy in Blood Rage is to shy away from battle and a glorious death!&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/HkZSJfQnZ3EpS214xtuplg__original/img/Myy6IPDJDzLoPdXrPXVZcddBQoQ=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2439223.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/HkZSJfQnZ3EpS214xtuplg__thumb/img/NLhVdU8xazrgS5dA6nVCYmN2DNI=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2439223.jpg
47	295947	Cascadia	Cascadia is a puzzly tile-laying and token-drafting game featuring the habitats and wildlife of the Pacific Northwest.&#10;&#10;In the game, you take turns building out your own terrain area and populating it with wildlife. You start with three hexagonal habitat tiles (with the five types of habitat in the game), and on a turn you choose a new habitat tile that's paired with a wildlife token, then place that tile next to your other ones and place the wildlife token on an appropriate habitat. (Each tile depicts 1-3 types of wildlife from the five types in the game, and you can place at most one tile on a habitat.) Four tiles are on display, with each tile being paired at random with a wildlife token, so you must make the best of what's available &mdash; unless you have a nature token to spend so that you can pick your choice of each item.&#10;&#10;Ideally you can place habitat tiles to create matching terrain that reduces fragmentation and creates wildlife corridors, mostly because you score for the largest area of each type of habitat at game's end, with a bonus if your group is larger than each other player's. At the same time, you want to place wildlife tokens so that you can maximize the number of points scored by them, with the wildlife goals being determined at random by one of the four scoring cards for each type of wildlife. Maybe hawks want to be separate from other hawks, while foxes want lots of different animals surrounding them and bears want to be in pairs. Can you make it happen?&#10;&#10;	\N	1	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/MjeJZfulbsM1DSV3DrGJYA__original/img/B374C04Eip7fmQBGJzgiOTp-jyQ=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5100691.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/MjeJZfulbsM1DSV3DrGJYA__thumb/img/tVSFjSxYEcw7sKj3unIIQV8kxoc=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5100691.jpg
293	134352	Two Rooms and a Boom	In Two Rooms and a Boom &ndash; a social deduction/hidden role party game for six or more players &ndash; there are two teams: the Red Team and the Blue Team. The Blue Team has a President. The Red Team has a Bomber. Players are equally distributed between two rooms (i.e., separate playing areas). The game consists of five timed rounds. At the end of each round, some players will be swapped into opposing rooms. If the Red Team's Bomber is in the same room as the President at the end of the game, then the Red Team wins; otherwise the Blue Team wins.

48	185343	Anachrony	It is the late 26th century. Earth is recovering from a catastrophic explosion that exterminated the majority of the population centuries ago and made most of the surface uninhabitable due to unearthly weather conditions. The surviving humans organized along four radically different ideologies, called Paths, to rebuild the world as they see fit: Harmony, Dominance, Progress, and Salvation. Followers of the four Paths live in a fragile peace, but in almost complete isolation next to each other. Their only meeting point is the last major city on Earth, now just known as the Capital.&#10;&#10;By powering up the mysterious Time Rifts that opened in the wake of the cataclysm, each Path is able to reach back to specific moments in their past. Doing so can greatly speed up their progress, but too much meddling may endanger the time-space continuum. But progress is more important than ever before: if the mysterious message arriving through the Time Rift is to be believed, an even more terrible cataclysm is looming on the horizon: an asteroid bearing the mysterious substance called Neutronium is heading towards Earth. Even stranger, the scientists show that the energy signature of the asteroid matches the explosion centuries ago...&#10;&#10;Anachrony features a unique two-tiered worker placement system. To travel to the Capital or venture out to the devastated areas for resources, players need not only various specialists (Engineers, Scientists, Administrators, and Geniuses) but also Exosuits to protect and enhance them &mdash; and both are in short supply.&#10;&#10;The game is played in 4-7 turns, depending on the time when the looming cataclysm occurs &mdash; unless, of course, it is averted! The elapsed turns are measured on a dynamic timeline. By powering up the Time Rifts, players can reach back to earlier turns to supply their past &quot;self&quot; with resources. Each Path has a vastly different objective that rewards it with a massive amount of victory points when achieved. The Paths' settlements will survive the impact, but the Capital will not. Whichever Path manages to collect most points will be the new seat for the Capital, thus the most important force left on the planet...&#10;&#10;	\N	1	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/31quLNzteInnevVRAABoow__original/img/3KfMPSj7jjhG0g5lQBsO-bn67D0=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3499707.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/31quLNzteInnevVRAABoow__thumb/img/a0G93aMOKp3_mmnCURYWuZd210U=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3499707.jpg
49	31260	Agricola	Description from BoardgameNews&#10;&#10;In Agricola, you're a farmer in a wooden shack with your spouse and little else. On a turn, you get to take only two actions, one for you and one for the spouse, from all the possibilities you'll find on a farm: collecting clay, wood, or stone; building fences; and so on. You might think about having kids in order to get more work accomplished, but first you need to expand your house. And what are you going to feed all the little rugrats?&#10;&#10;The game supports many levels of complexity, mainly through the use (or non-use) of two of its main types of cards, Minor Improvements and Occupations. In the beginner's version (called the Family Variant in the U.S. release), these cards are not used at all. For advanced play, the U.S. release includes three levels of both types of cards; Basic (E-deck), Interactive (I-deck), and Complex (K-deck), and the rulebook encourages players to experiment with the various decks and mixtures thereof. Aftermarket decks such as the Z-Deck and the L-Deck also exist.&#10;&#10;Agricola is a turn-based game. There are 14 game rounds occurring in 6 stages, with a Harvest at the end of each stage (after Rounds 4, 7, 9, 11, 13, and 14).&#10;Each player starts with two playing tokens (farmer and spouse) and thus can take two turns, or actions, per round. There are multiple options, and while the game progresses, you'll have more and more: first thing in a round, a new action card is flipped over.&#10;Problem: Each action can be taken by only one player each round, so it's important to do some things with high preference.&#10;Each player also starts with a hand of 7 Occupation cards (of more than 160 total) and 7 Minor Improvement cards (of more than 140 total) that he/she may use during the game if they fit in his/her strategy. Speaking of which, there are countless strategies, some depending on your card hand. Sometimes it's a good choice to stay on course, and sometimes it is better to react to your opponents' actions...&#10;&#10;	\N	1	5	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/dDDo2Hexl80ucK1IlqTk-g__original/img/toobKoejPiHpfpHk4SYd1UAJafw=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic831744.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/dDDo2Hexl80ucK1IlqTk-g__thumb/img/GHGdnCfeysoP_34gLnofJcNivW8=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic831744.jpg
50	184267	On Mars	Following the success of unmanned rover missions, the United Nations established the Department of Operations and Mars Exploration (D.O.M.E.). The first settlers arrived on Mars in the year 2037 and in the decades after establishment Mars Base Camp, private exploration companies began work on the creation of a self-sustaining colony. As chief astronaut for one of these enterprises, you want to be a pioneer in the development of the biggest, most advanced colony on Mars by achieving both D.O.M.E. mission goals as well as your company&rsquo;s private agenda.&#10;&#10;In the beginning, you will be dependent on supplies from Earth and will have to travel often between the Mars Space Station and the planet's surface. As the colony expands over time, you will shift your activities to construct mines, power generators, water extractors, greenhouses, oxygen factories, and shelters. Your goal is to develop a self-sustaining colony independent of any terrestrial organization. This will require understanding the importance of water, air, power, and food &mdash; the necessities for survival.&#10;&#10;Do you dare take part in humankind&rsquo;s biggest challenge?&#10;&#10;On Mars is played over several rounds, each consisting of two phases - the Colonization Phase &#226;&#128;&#139;and the Shuttle Phase&#226;&#128;&#139;.&#10;&#10;During the Colonization Phase, each player takes a turn during which they take actions. The available actions depend on the side of the board they are on. If you are in orbit, you can take blueprints, buy and develop technologies, and take supplies from the Warehouse. If you are on the surface of the planet, you can construct buildings with your bots, upgrade these buildings using blueprints, take scientists and new contracts, welcome new ships, and explore the planet&rsquo;s surface with your rover. In the Shuttle Phase, players may travel between the colony and the Space Station in orbit.&#10;&#10;All buildings on Mars have a dependency on each other and some are required for the colony to grow. Building shelters for Colonists to live in requires oxygen; generating oxygen requires plants; growing plants requires water; extracting water from ice requires power; generating power requires mining minerals; and mining minerals requires Colonists. Upgrading the colony&rsquo;s ability to provide each of these resources is vital. As the colony grows, more shelters are needed so that the Colonists can survive the inhospitable conditions on Mars.&#10;&#10;During the game, players are also trying to complete missions. Once a total of three missions have been completed, the game ends. To win the game, players must contribute to the development of the first colony on Mars. This is represented during the game by players gaining Opportunity Points (OP). The player with the most OP at the end of the game is declared the winner.&#10;&#10;	\N	1	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Nm0Iw8NoiM9V8IsifimGBw__original/img/GNjjsgxq7wYO9pSIteDJe6Sxt00=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4357658.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Nm0Iw8NoiM9V8IsifimGBw__thumb/img/4GFbhkEWyIublXmikE2Tep6wSIQ=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4357658.jpg
51	521	Crokinole	Crokinole is a traditional dexterity game.&#10;&#10;Crokinole is played on a circular wooden board, with wooden circular disks as playing pieces.&#10;&#10;Players take turns shooting disks across the circular wooden board by flicking the disks with their fingers.  Players try to land their disks in scoring regions on the board, with the highest scoring area the recessed hole in the very center of the board.  Each round, each player/side alternately shoots a set number of disks (usually 12 or 8), shooting one disk each turn.&#10;&#10;As a traditional game, there are often many variations played, but the following method is based on the National Crokinole Association's rules which also govern the World Crokinole Championship.&#10;&#10;Players must position their disk on the start of each of their turns in their quadrant in front of them, touching the outer scoring ring boundary.&#10;&#10;If there are no opponent's disks on the board, they must aim for the center of the board.&#10;&#10;If there is an opponent's disk on the board, they must aim and hit an opponent's piece first, either directly, or by a carrom shot.&#10;&#10;The center recessed hole is worth 20 points, and disks are removed and scored at the end of the round if they land in the center hole.&#10;&#10;Disks that are outside the outer scoring ring at the end of each shot, or are touching the outer scoring ring at the end of each shot, are removed from play for the round.&#10;&#10;Scoring is by cancellation scoring (e.g. Player/Side One scores 250, and Player/Side Two scores 225, Player/Side One scores 25.)&#10;&#10;It is usually played as a two-player game or as a four-player game with partners.&#10;&#10;Play is to a set score, usually the first player/side to 100.&#10;&#10;Alternately, play is set at &quot;Match Scoring&quot; where the winner of each round scores 2 points, and if a tie, each player scores 1 point. A &quot;game&quot; is usually played to four rounds, with the winner of each &quot;game&quot; being the one with the most points. The numbers of &quot;games&quot; in a match is set by the tournament.&#10;&#10;The World Crokinole Championship uses &quot;Match Scoring.&quot;&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/7ejbxsn-UtLl3ehamuAEdw__original/img/HJOZG6y87_skppfIqX-voRlhNxE=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic79413.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/7ejbxsn-UtLl3ehamuAEdw__thumb/img/AX0pNTuAzpUfxlvtwirM6zAK4ws=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic79413.jpg
52	284378	Kanban EV	Electric vehicles (EVs) have become more common since 2014 and are the future of the automobile industry. They are superior vehicles due to them being more efficient, easier to maintain, cleaner, and cheaper to run. They are computerized machines that use AI to improve safety and in the near future will provide autonomous driving. They receive software upgrades during their lifetime and are constantly improving, unlike their traditional combustion-engine counterparts, which start to become obsolete as soon as you start using them.&#10;&#10;You will be overseeing the production of these vehicles in Kanban EV, with &quot;kanban&quot; (&#231;&#156;&#139;&#230;&#157;&#191;) being the name for a scheduling system that supports an efficient assembly line, just-in-time production, and a smooth workflow process. Over the course of the game, players take on the role of rookie employees who are trying to secure their career. You need to manage suppliers and supplies, improve and innovate automobile parts, and get your hands greasy on the assembly line in order to boost production and impress the factory manager.&#10;&#10;You must make shrewd use of the recycling facilities and the limited factory supplies in order to appropriate parts when the suppliers come up short. Because the factory must run at optimum efficiency, production doesn't wait for you or for mistakes. Sandra, the factory manager, will review your performance and keep the factory on tempo.&#10;&#10;Kanban EV is a game that focuses on resource and time management that puts you in the driver's seat of an entire production facility, racing for factory goals and the highest level of promotion. You earn production points (PP) for performing various actions in the game, and the player with the most PP at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from publisher&#10;&#10;Includes solo mode by D&aacute;vid Turczi&#10;&#10;	\N	1	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/L2Wn-zUqkcHgqvwvY212Ig__original/img/Htra4hvxjBlejtNEIUns_B3CNNc=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4924232.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/L2Wn-zUqkcHgqvwvY212Ig__thumb/img/RQunBacBw949DkYBgzoS5YaXgJo=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4924232.jpg
850	217780	Gentes	Gentes is an interesting civilization game with an innovative timing mechanism.&#10;&#10;&quot;Gentes&quot; is a pleonasm of the Latin plural word for greater groups of human beings (e.g., tribes, nations, people; singular: &quot;gens&quot;). In this game, players take the role of an ancient people who are attempting to develop by building monuments and colonizing or founding new cities in the Mediterranean sea.&#10;&#10;The game is played in six rounds, each consisting of two phases: action phase, and tidying up. There are three eras &mdash; rounds 1-2, 3-4, 5-6 &mdash; with new monument cards entering the game at the beginning of rounds 1, 3 and 5. Each player has a personal player mat with a time track for action markers and sand timer markers. In the action phase of a round, the players take their turns in clockwise order, conducting one action per turn. Each action requires an action marker from the main board that is placed on the time track. Depending on the information on the action marker, you have to also pay some money or take sand timers that are placed on the time track. When you have no free spaces on your time track, you must pass for the remainder of the round. Therefore, the number of actions per player in a single round may vary significantly if, for example, you choose double sand timers instead of two single ones or take action markers that require more money but fewer sand timers. Single sand timers are dropped in the tidying up phase, while double sand timers are flipped to become single sand timer markers and stay for another round. The actions are:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Buy new cards from the common display&#10;    Build monuments (playing cards from your hand to your personal display for victory points and new options)&#10;    Train/Educate your people&#10;    Build/found cities&#10;    Take money&#10;&#10;&#10;To play a card, you must meet the requirements printed on that card, such as having specific persons on your personal board (e.g., two priests and four soldiers). These requirements are why training &mdash; i.e., getting specific people &mdash; is important, but that is not that easy because there are six different types of people &mdash; three on the left and three on the right side of your personal player board &mdash; and you have only six spaces in total for the two types in the same line. If you have three merchants, for example, you move your marker for counting merchants three spaces toward the side of the soldiers and thus you have only three spaces left for soldiers. By educating a fourth soldier and moving your soldier marker forward to its fourth space, you automatically lose one merchant because that marker is pushed back to its second space.&#10;&#10;It is crucial to generate additional actions by using the specific functions of monuments in your display and cities you have built. Cities are expensive, but they create benefits at the end of each round or provide new options for taking an action without acquiring an action marker, gaining only a sand timer marker instead.&#10;&#10;Try to have a steady income to avoid wasting actions to take money. Pay attention to the display of common cards, which is new in every single game, because the monument cards are shuffled randomly within the decks of eras I, II and III. Collect identical achievement symbols on the cards to benefit from the increasing victory points for a series of symbols. Build cities to enlarge your options!&#10;&#10;The differences between the Deluxified and regular edition:&#10;&#10;Includes &quot;New Cities&quot; Expansion&#10;A foil stamped box&#10;6 oversized meeples&#10;24 normal sized meeples&#10;89 metal coins&#10;28 wood action tokens&#10;21 wood lock tokens&#10;60 wood hourglass tokens&#10;4 dual layered player boards&#10;4 custom shaped score tokens&#10;folded space custom insert&#10;1 drawstring bag&#10;1 upgraded round token&#10;&#10;	\N	1	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/PUF7QgKx50WOVuB0tEHLaw__original/img/G5V_oz5FazS_wipaJnFmQ0HiT8Y=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3338929.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/PUF7QgKx50WOVuB0tEHLaw__thumb/img/4WS47K3z3mtKbWKJ2p5iGkIwSUo=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3338929.jpg

You and your fellow medical graduates have been recruited by the CIA for the critical mission of investigating and preventing its development. Travel the world using carefully constructed aliases to move swiftly between Allied, Neutral, and Soviet cities. Your missions will require you to neutralize enemy agents, acquire specific targets, and set up other CIA agents on location to execute your operations without a hitch. As you complete objectives over the course of twelve months, each success or failure will bring you closer to the truth.&#10;&#10;Combatting this dangerous new pathogen is of utmost importance, but it's not the only threat you'll encounter in the field. Enemy agents are taking root in all parts of the world, and it's critical to your mission that you keep them contained before they can escalate international tensions. Luckily for you, you won't be without backup. Coordinate with other covert operatives for assistance and make strategic use of these teams at different locations to clean up the board and keep your eye on your main objectives.&#10;&#10;Designed as a prequel, Pandemic Legacy: Season 0 does not require you to have completed Season 1 and Season 2 before diving into this Cold War spy thriller.

59	161533	Lisboa	Lisboa is a game about the reconstruction of Lisboa after the great earthquake of 1755.&#10;&#10;On November 1, 1755, Lisbon suffered an earthquake of an estimated magnitude of 8.5&ndash;9.0, followed by a tsunami and three days of fires. The city was almost totally destroyed. The Marques of Pombal &mdash; Sebasti&atilde;o Jos&eacute; de Carvalho e Melo &mdash; was the then Minister of Foreign Affairs and the King put him in charge of the reconstruction of Lisbon. The Marques of Pombal gathered a team of engineers and architects and you, the players, are members of the nobility; members who will use your influence in the reconstruction and business development of the new city. You will work with the architects to build Lisbon anew, with the Marquis to develop commerce and with the King to open all the buildings, but the true reason you do all this is not for greatness or fame or even fortune, but for the most important thing of all in that time: wigs.&#10;&#10;Lisboa is played on a real map of downtown Lisbon. During the planning of the downtown project, the type of business permitted in each street was previously determined. The economic motor is driven by the wealth of the royal treasure and this treasure is controlled by player actions during the game, making each game a totally different experience. The game ends after a fixed number of rounds and whoever gathers the most wigs by the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;Lisboa is played in rounds. Each round, all players play one turn. They may place one card on their display or replace one card from this display. During the game, players schedule hearings to get character favors, such as commerce, construction, and openings. The iconic buildings score the stores and stores provide income to the players. Players need to manage influence, construction licenses, store permits, church power, workers and money, with the workers' cost being dependent on the prestige of the players.&#10;&#10;	\N	1	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/OrHS8_a1CqSGiXeTfCk0Wg__original/img/hVArRkZYHiPTGTfi0DPR58i4o44=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3209553.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/OrHS8_a1CqSGiXeTfCk0Wg__thumb/img/ZBTT0qZcD5HMFlhFN7PLMe6zXvg=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3209553.jpg
60	126163	Tzolk'in: The Mayan Calendar	Tzolkin: The Mayan Calendar presents a new game mechanism: dynamic worker placement. Players representing different Mayan tribes place their workers on giant connected gears, and as the gears rotate they take the workers to different action spots.&#10;&#10;During a turn, players can either (a) place one or more workers on the lowest visible spot of the gears or (b) pick up one or more workers. When placing workers, they must pay corn, which is used as a currency in the game. When they pick up a worker, they perform certain actions depending on the position of the worker. Actions located &quot;later&quot; on the gears are more valuable, so it's wise to let the time work for you &ndash; but players cannot skip their turn; if they have all their workers on the gears, they have to pick some up.&nbsp;&#10;&#10;The game ends after one full revolution of the central Tzolkin gear.

61	2651	Power Grid	Power Grid is the updated release of the Friedemann Friese crayon game Funkenschlag. It removes the crayon aspect from network building in the original edition, while retaining the fluctuating commodities market like Crude: The Oil Game and an auction round intensity reminiscent of The Princes of Florence.&#10;&#10;The objective of Power Grid is to supply the most cities with power when someone's network gains a predetermined size.  In this new edition, players mark pre-existing routes between cities for connection, and then bid against each other to purchase the power plants that they use to power their cities.&#10;&#10;However, as plants are purchased, newer, more efficient plants become available, so by merely purchasing, you're potentially allowing others access to superior equipment.&#10;&#10;Additionally, players must acquire the raw materials (coal, oil, garbage, and uranium) needed to power said plants (except for the 'renewable' windfarm/ solar plants, which require no fuel), making it a constant struggle to upgrade your plants for maximum efficiency while still retaining enough wealth to quickly expand your network to get the cheapest routes.&#10;&#10;Power Grid FAQ - Please read this before posting a rules question!  Many questions are asked over and over in the forums... If you have a question about a specific expansion, please check the rules forum or FAQ for that particular expansion.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	6	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/yd6LuatytHRhcFCxCf-EEg__original/img/OS13C6W4i1XW__wWVVVaqF7BV0c=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4459753.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/yd6LuatytHRhcFCxCf-EEg__thumb/img/jWTonZ5oYNlPzpELKHIJGWSS0Y8=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4459753.jpg

Take care with what you add, though, for a pinch too much of this or that will spoil the whole mixture!&#10;&#10;Each player has their own bag of ingredient chips. During each round, they simultaneously draw chips from their bags and add them to their pots. The higher the face value of the drawn chip, the further it is placed in the pot's swirling pattern, increasing how much the potion will be worth. Push your luck as far as you can, but if you add too many cherry bombs, your pot will explode!&#10;&#10;At the end of each round, players gain victory points and coins to spend on new ingredients, depending on how well they managed to fill up their pots. But players whose pots have exploded must choose points or coins &mdash; not both!

322	1822	Wilderness War	Wilderness War is a card-driven wargame, dramatically simpler and more streamlined than either For the People or Paths of Glory, but the complexity still exceeds the classic Hannibal: Rome vs. Carthage, but only just.&#10;&#10;In Wilderness War, the players get to re-fight the 7 Years War in North America. Although only a single deck of strategy cards is used, &agrave; la We the People, the two sides are dramatically different in character: the French are irregular-heavy (especially Indians) and rely on raiding to tie down the superior numbers of British Regular &amp; Provincial drilled troops, who will themselves be intent on sieges and trying to force a pitched battle. Like Hannibal: Rome vs. Carthage, the fortunes of war turn as the game goes on: the French are masters early, with the crushing British manpower advantage accruing late.&#10;&#10;Wilderness War takes two players into the French &amp; Indian War, 1755-1760, the climactic struggle between France and Britain for control of North America. It uses strategy cards and a point-to-point map similar to GMT's award winning For the People and Paths of Glory. Players maneuver and fight over a map stretching from Northern Virginia to Canada. As the leader of French or British forces in North America, you will need to defend your frontier, raid your enemy's frontier, build fortification networks through the harsh wilderness, recruit Indian allies, besiege forts and fortresses, and deal with events occurring in Europe that are above and beyond your control.&#10;&#10;Wilderness War includes a deck of strategy cards for conducting campaigns and incorporating the many events and personalities of the war. The French player can recruit up to sixteen different Indian tribes as allies, secure a continental alliance in Europe against Great Britain, sortie his squadron at Louisbourg, force a ministerial crisis in London, and work toward draining support for the war from the provincial assemblies. The British player can recruit Mohawks and Cherokees, plan for and conduct amphibious operations, implement a global strategy via William Pitt, destroy the French fleet at Quiberon Bay, and expel the Acadians. Relive the history of this exciting time when the fate of Canada hung in the balance.&#10;&#10;Wilderness War is by the designer of the more recent Labyrinth: The War on Terror, 2001 &#226;&#128;&#147; ? and Andean Abyss and other Series: COIN (GMT) games.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	2	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/dJTaPtiDrgIrG3ZOdR2eRg__original/img/BRwyl0Pz9WbQO9imX2lJLh3O02I=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1525886.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/dJTaPtiDrgIrG3ZOdR2eRg__thumb/img/giD9ASz1eaKEOt41okPMKLcLlL8=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1525886.jpg
63	216132	Clans of Caledonia	Clans of Caledonia is a mid-to-heavy economic game set in 19th-century Scotland. At this time, Scotland made the transition from an agricultural to an industrialized country that heavily relied on trade and export. In the following years, food production increased significantly to feed the population growth. Linen was increasingly substituted by the cheaper cotton and raising sheep was given high importance. More and more distilleries were founded and whisky became the premium alcoholic beverage in Europe.&#10;&#10;Players represent historic clans with unique abilities and compete to produce, trade and export agricultural goods and of course whisky!&#10;&#10;The game ends after five rounds. Each round consists of the three phases:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Players' turns&#10;     Production phase&#10;     Round scoring&#10;&#10;&#10;1. Players take turns and do one of eight possible actions, from building, to upgrading, trading and exporting. When players run out of money, they pass and collect a passing bonus.&#10;&#10;2. In the production phase, each player collects basic resources, refined goods and cash from their production units built on the game map. Each production unit built makes income visible on the player mat. Refined goods require the respective basic resource.&#10;&#10;3. Players receive VPs depending on the scoring tile of the current round.&#10;&#10;The game comes with eight different clans, a modular board with 16 configurations, eight port bonuses and eight round scoring tiles.&#10;&#10;	\N	1	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/SPuwc6RJ6y4PnTH36Pegsg__original/img/GcuvCavv-ZZP5_O1kCTrZELuZdY=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic3511783.png	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/SPuwc6RJ6y4PnTH36Pegsg__thumb/img/M_6Yxp0A_NbebWk3Mepinsm96WI=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3511783.png
64	35677	Le Havre	In Le Havre, a player's turn consists of two parts: First, distribute newly supplied goods onto the offer spaces; then take an action. As an action, players may choose either to take all goods of one type from an offer space or to use one of the available buildings. Building actions allow players to upgrade goods, sell them or use them to build their own buildings and ships. Buildings are both an investment opportunity and a revenue stream, as players must pay an entry fee to use buildings that they do not own. Ships, on the other hand, are primarily used to provide the food that is needed to feed the workers.&#10;&#10;After every seven turns, the round ends: players' cattle and grain may multiply through a Harvest, and players must feed their workers. After a fixed number of rounds, each player may carry out one final action, and then the game ends. Players add the value of their buildings and ships to their cash reserves. The player who has amassed the largest fortune is the winner.&#10;&#10;	\N	1	5	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/y7Rqd3S6J7vyVhicR1bqTQ__original/img/tQFXv1w2R-J-1cjyaKG9LAS2UOs=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic6091101.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/y7Rqd3S6J7vyVhicR1bqTQ__thumb/img/w1iHoYZCVTDZI6gsPuxOScA7FqU=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6091101.jpg
65	266810	Paladins of the West Kingdom	Paladins of the West Kingdom is set at a turbulent time of West Francia's story, circa 900 AD. Despite recent efforts to develop the city, outlying townships are still under threat from outsiders. Saracens scout the borders, while Vikings plunder wealth and livestock. Even the Byzantines from the east have shown their darker side. As noble men and women, players must gather workers from the city to defend against enemies, build fortifications and spread faith throughout the land. Fortunately you are not alone. In his great wisdom, the King has sent his finest knights to help aid in our efforts. So ready the horses and sharpen the swords. The Paladins are approaching.&#10;&#10;The aim of Paladins of the West Kingdom is to be the player with the most victory points (VP) at game's end. Points are gained by building outposts and fortifications, commissioning monks and confronting outsiders. Each round, players will enlist the help of a specific Paladin and gather workers to carry out tasks. As the game progresses, players will slowly increase their faith, strength and influence. Not only will these affect their final score, but they will also determine the significance of their actions. The game is concluded at the end of the seventh round.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;	\N	1	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/4nhokcLdYoo6ulbZ1rmGgA__original/img/9ktZDu003VVVTw0RxD-ufLYV1HQ=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic4462987.png	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/4nhokcLdYoo6ulbZ1rmGgA__thumb/img/1gEbke_bKTA6D2jjpPm1HowGGHM=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4462987.png
66	164153	Star Wars: Imperial Assault	Star Wars: Imperial Assault is a strategy board game of tactical combat and missions for two to five players, offering two distinct games of battle and adventure in the Star Wars universe!&#10;&#10;Imperial Assault puts you in the midst of the Galactic Civil War between the Rebel Alliance and the Galactic Empire after the destruction of the Death Star over Yavin 4. In this game, you and your friends can participate in two separate games. The campaign game pits the limitless troops and resources of the Galactic Empire against a crack team of elite Rebel operatives as they strive to break the Empire&rsquo;s hold on the galaxy, while the skirmish game invites you and a friend to muster strike teams and battle head-to-head over conflicting objectives.&#10;&#10;In the campaign game, Imperial Assault invites you to play through a cinematic tale set in the Star Wars universe. One player commands the seemingly limitless armies of the Galactic Empire, threatening to extinguish the flame of the Rebellion forever. Up to four other players become heroes of the Rebel Alliance, engaging in covert operations to undermine the Empire&rsquo;s schemes. Over the course of the campaign, both the Imperial player and the Rebel heroes gain new experience and skills, allowing characters to evolve as the story unfolds.&#10;&#10;Imperial Assault offers a different game experience in the skirmish game. In skirmish missions, you and a friend compete in head-to-head, tactical combat. You&rsquo;ll gather your own strike force of Imperials, Rebels, and Mercenaries and build a deck of command cards to gain an unexpected advantage in the heat of battle. Whether you recover lost holocrons or battle to defeat a raiding party, you&rsquo;ll find danger and tactical choices in every skirmish.&#10;&#10;As an additional benefit, the Luke Skywalker Ally Pack and the Darth Vader Villain Pack are included within the Imperial Assault Core Set. These figure packs offer sculpted plastic figures alongside additional campaign and skirmish missions that highlight both Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader within Imperial Assault.&#10;&#10;With these Imperial Assault and other Figure Packs, you'll find even more missions that allow your heroes to fight alongside iconic characters from the Star Wars saga. Boxed expansions add more heroes, imperial and mercenary groups, and totally new campaigns (see IA Community Wiki for a list), and the free Star Wars: Imperial Assault &#226;&#128;&#147; Legends of the Alliance app provides you with additional content to play in solo or co-op mode.&#10;&#10;	\N	1	5	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/pIQ_MXvaoARRp1loCHJuHg__original/img/12Xvbw01hpsAjsO0xrajZt2b5HY=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2247647.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/pIQ_MXvaoARRp1loCHJuHg__thumb/img/AD5YvNSUaVvITmtQb1-b01VuBbs=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2247647.jpg
156	283948	Marco Polo II: In the Service of the Khan	The journeys of Marco Polo continue in Marco Polo II: In the Service of the Khan, an epic follow-up to The Voyages of Marco Polo. After traveling to Beijing, your travels now take you back to the West in the service of the Khan, sending you to the farthest reaches of his empire in search of wealth and fame.&#10;&#10;Marco Polo II is a standalone game based on The Voyages of Marco Polo, and you don't need the original game to play this one. This new journey will present unique challenges, with new and different actions, new scoring rules, and a new good: rare and valuable Chinese jade.&#10;&#10;Retread old paths with renewed purpose, or find new ones as you explore farther west, continuing to build the immortal legacy of Marco Polo!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/rc7CQ5l95ZFoKq3iBVqjgg__original/img/3EH__HLlmY7adABsY_HUtAlEMfo=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5543526.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/rc7CQ5l95ZFoKq3iBVqjgg__thumb/img/3W5hTyRw8ABDkasT1mFSAf4f30w=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5543526.jpg
69	182874	Grand Austria Hotel	In the thick of the Viennese modern age, exquisite caf&eacute;s are competing for customers. Inspiring artists, important politicians, and tourists from all over the world are populating Vienna and in need of a hotel room. This is your opportunity to turn your little caf&eacute; into a world famous hotel. Hire staff, fulfill the wishes of your guests, and gain the emperor's favor. Only then will your caf&eacute; become the Grand Austria Hotel.&#10;&#10;The start player rolls the dice, sorting them by the rolled number and placing them on the corresponding action spaces. On a turn, a player chooses one of the six actions and carries it out. The number of the available dice in the corresponding action spaces determines how much the player gets from the action. They then remove one of the dice and can carry out additional actions. With the different actions, a player can get the necessary drinks and dishes, prepare the rooms, or hire staff.&#10;&#10;But no hotel can grow without guests. To choose wisely which guests to attract and to complete their orders brings some important bonus actions. The staff cards also have different advantages, but the game ends after seven rounds and no player can do everything they want, so whoever makes the right decisions and finds the best way to create bonus actions will win.&#10;&#10;With 116 different cards and a new set-up in each game, Grand Austria Hotel provides a huge replay value. Each game stands on its own and demands new tactics and strategies.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/GlCmHjdLwv3SqSjv52ToGw__original/img/5vNCdK9mQ0szo_SwSeVQUWnirZ8=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic6966955.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/GlCmHjdLwv3SqSjv52ToGw__thumb/img/WXzXZh50EGKd1U2fg75fCbFIL_8=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6966955.jpg
70	209010	Mechs vs. Minions	Mechs vs. Minions is a cooperative tabletop campaign for 2-4 players. Set in the world of Runeterra, players take on the roles of four intrepid Yordles: Corki, Tristana, Heimerdinger, and Ziggs, who must join forces and pilot their newly-crafted mechs against an army of marauding minions. With modular boards, programmatic command lines, and a story-driven campaign, each mission will be unique, putting your teamwork, programming, and piloting skills to the test.&#10;&#10;There are ten missions in total, and each individual mission will take about 60-90 minutes. The box includes five game boards, four command lines (one for each player), four painted mech miniatures, ability and damage decks, a sand timer, a bomb-like-power source miniature, 6 metal trackers, 4 acrylic shards, 4 dice, and 100 minion miniatures.  There also appears to be some large object trying to get out of that sealed box...&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/n4J5LebMj0DQD016qW7ABw__original/img/KDP4s1942J-T52OEytY2VpUWZC0=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3184103.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/n4J5LebMj0DQD016qW7ABw__thumb/img/Nbu-AYVIop-1yvVfs5zjKowtlEQ=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3184103.jpg
71	253344	Cthulhu: Death May Die	In Cthulhu: Death May Die, inspired by the writings of H.P. Lovecraft, you and your fellow players represent investigators in the 1920s who instead of trying to stop the coming of Elder Gods, want to summon those otherworldly beings so that you can put a stop to them permanently. You start the game insane, and while your long-term goal is to shoot Cthulhu in the face, so to speak, at some point during the game you'll probably fail to mitigate your dice rolls properly and your insanity will cause you to do something terrible &mdash; or maybe advantageous. Hard to know for sure.&#10;&#10;The game has multiple episodes, and each of them has a similar structure of two acts, those being before and after you summon whatever it is you happen to be summoning. If any character dies prior to the summoning, then the game ends and you lose; once the Elder One is on the board, as long as one of you is still alive, you still have a chance to win.&#10;&#10;The episodes are all standalone and not contingent on being played in a certain order or with the same players.&#10;&#10;	\N	1	5	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/e8D09pfFsUsoX1D81EeoZg__original/img/8_FKwPd8bBL3PFjef8Yjz_sFWSk=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4705171.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/e8D09pfFsUsoX1D81EeoZg__thumb/img/j03wBmZg1Kp5QaaIu9p-O8XRqeU=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4705171.jpg
72	124742	Android: Netrunner	Welcome to New Angeles, home of the Beanstalk. From our branch offices in this monument of human achievement, NBN proudly broadcasts all your favorite media programming. We offer fully comprehensive streaming in music and threedee, news and sitcoms, classic movies and sensies. We cover it all. Ours is a brave new age, and as humanity hurtles into space and the future with an astonishing series of new advances every day, NBN and our affiliates are keeping pace, bringing you all the vid that's fit to view.&#10;&#10;Android: Netrunner is an asymmetrical Living Card Game for two players. Set in the cyberpunk future of Android and Infiltration, the game pits a megacorporation and its massive resources against the subversive talents of lone runners.&#10;&#10;Corporations seek to score agendas by advancing them. Doing so takes time and credits. To buy the time and earn the credits they need, they must secure their servers and data forts with &quot;ice&quot;. These security programs come in different varieties, from simple barriers, to code gates and aggressive sentries. They serve as the corporation's virtual eyes, ears, and machine guns on the sprawling information superhighways of the network.&#10;&#10;In turn, runners need to spend their time and credits acquiring a sufficient wealth of resources, purchasing the necessary hardware, and developing suitably powerful ice-breaker programs to hack past corporate security measures. Their jobs are always a little desperate, driven by tight timelines, and shrouded in mystery. When a runner jacks-in and starts a run at a corporate server, he risks having his best programs trashed or being caught by a trace program and left vulnerable to corporate countermeasures. It's not uncommon for an unprepared runner to fail to bypass a nasty sentry and suffer massive brain damage as a result. Even if a runner gets through a data fort's defenses, there's no telling what it holds. Sometimes, the runner finds something of value. Sometimes, the best he can do is work to trash whatever the corporation was developing.&#10;&#10;The first player to seven points wins the game, but not likely before he suffers some brain damage or bad publicity.&#10;&#10;The Revised Core Set for Android: Netrunner released in late 2017 includes cards from the original Core Set released in 2012 as well as cards from the Genesis Cycle and Spin Cycle series of Data Packs. While the cards in this set have been released previously, the art on some of them is new.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	2	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/2ewHIIG_TRq8bYlqk0jIMw__original/img/cassW39WF2QrPImJF59efADAmM0=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3738560.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/2ewHIIG_TRq8bYlqk0jIMw__thumb/img/IJaOyyQ7Y59tW6nbKbjTMTFt-Ls=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3738560.jpg
73	55690	Kingdom Death: Monster	Kingdom Death: Monster is a fully cooperative tabletop hobby game experience.  Set in a unique nightmarish world devoid of most natural resources, you control a settlement at the dawn of its existence. Fight monsters, craft weapons and gear, and develop your settlement to ensure your survival from generation to generation.&#10;&#10;Campaign System&#10;Embark alone or with up to 3 friends (5 with game variant) on a 5-30-lantern-year campaign, with each year consisting of a cycle of hunt, showdown, and settlement phases. The settlement phase is an intricate civilization building game in which you spend very limited resources to build buildings, research new technologies, train your warriors, and set up your strategy for survival.  During the hunt, you'll encounter a series of stories in a &quot;choose your own adventure&quot; style journey through various events and encounters.  Finally, when you meet the monster you're pursuing, you'll engage it in an a massive arena-style battle where only one party is going to survive.  If your party lives, you'll be able to bring the spoils back home to use in expanding your settlement.&#10;&#10;Monster AI System&#10;Each of the 7 monsters included are controlled by their own pair of decks that scale to 3 levels of difficulty (except for the final encounter, which has only 1 level and it's HARD!). Every encounter, even with the same monster, is highly variable and no two showdowns will resolve the same way. Players will have to plan their gear and keep their minds sharp to prevail.&#10;&#10;Gear System&#10;In Kingdom Death: Monster, survivors will craft gear from resources earned from defeating monsters or found on their hunt. Each survivor has a 3x3 gear grid. Selection and arrangement of your gear cards is critical, as many provided bonuses and activate special rules when aligned correctly.&#10;&#10;Story Event System&#10;40+ Story Events plus over 100 hunt encounters will shape and guide your campaign. Story Events detail important evolutions in your civilization, introduce new monsters, and provide rich detail for your campaign.  Some will trigger automatically as you progress through the campaign, but most will be entirely based on choices players make.&#10;&#10;Story Events cover everything from setting up and fighting a monster to key events that happen within the overall story. Some are triggered directly from the timeline and others from choices you make in game.&#10;&#10;	\N	1	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/LenzJBOHboAGU0cUIqAZPQ__original/img/-dnx4zkvdOn3CMVHpXIfESazj40=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2931007.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/LenzJBOHboAGU0cUIqAZPQ__thumb/img/Z3yFJIp9rmSmcGoTiqGeTkKCnQU=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2931007.jpg
74	230802	Azul	Introduced by the Moors, azulejos (originally white and blue ceramic tiles) were fully embraced by the Portuguese when their king Manuel I, on a visit to the Alhambra palace in Southern Spain, was mesmerized by the stunning beauty of the Moorish decorative tiles. The king, awestruck by the interior beauty of the Alhambra, immediately ordered that his own palace in Portugal be decorated with similar wall tiles. As a tile-laying artist, you have been challenged to embellish the walls of the Royal Palace of Evora.&#10;&#10;In the game Azul, players take turns drafting colored tiles from suppliers to their player board. Later in the round, players score points based on how they've placed their tiles to decorate the palace. Extra points are scored for specific patterns and completing sets; wasted supplies harm the player's score. The player with the most points at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/aPSHJO0d0XOpQR5X-wJonw__original/img/AkbtYVc6xXJF3c9EUrakklcclKw=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic6973671.png	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/aPSHJO0d0XOpQR5X-wJonw__thumb/img/ccsXKrdGJw-YSClWwzVUwk5Nh9Y=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6973671.png
75	200680	Agricola (Revised Edition)	Updated and streamlined for a new generation of players, Agricola, the award-winning and highly acclaimed game by Uwe Rosenberg, features a revised rulebook and gameplay, along with wood pieces and components for up to four players.&#10;&#10;The 17th century was not an easy time to be a farmer.  A game for 1-4 players ages 12 and up; play time is 30 minutes per player. Amazing replay value. The Agricola base game is a revised edition of Uwe Rosenberg&rsquo;s celebrated classic. The game features improved all-wood components and a card selection from the base game as well as its expansions, revised and updated for this edition. Players begin the game with two family members and can grow their families over the course of the game. This allows them more actions but remember you have to grow more food to feed your family as it grows! Feeding your family is a special kind of challenge and players will plant grain and vegetables while supplementing their food supply with sheep, wild boar and cattle. Guide your family to wealth, health and prosperity and you will win the game.&#10;&#10;	\N	1	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Vf_0TrTfz9yll7rVBvYGsg__original/img/K6dtSMTAibW5f0QhHXo37CeuECc=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3029377.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Vf_0TrTfz9yll7rVBvYGsg__thumb/img/booIzVH8Wg4YJa7hIvzgIqwV25Y=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3029377.jpg
76	28143	Race for the Galaxy	2018 UPDATE: The second edition of the game is improved for CVD (color blindness) and includes 5 revised cards from the original version and 6 New Worlds promo homeworlds. The promo homeworlds and first edition compatible Revised Cards are both available for purchase through the BGG store.&#10;&#10;In the card game Race for the Galaxy, players build galactic civilizations by playing game cards in front of them that represent worlds or technical and social developments. Some worlds allow players to produce goods, which can be consumed later to gain either card draws or victory points when the appropriate technologies are available to them. These are mainly provided by the developments and worlds that are not able to produce, but the fancier production worlds also give these bonuses.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of each round, players each select, secretly and simultaneously, one of the seven roles which correspond to the phases in which the round progresses. By selecting a role, players activate that phase for this round, giving each player the opportunity to perform that phase's action. For example, if one player chooses the settle role, each player has the opportunity to settle one of the planets from their hand. The player who has chosen the role, however, gets a bonus that applies only to them. But bonuses may also be acquired through developments, so you must be aware when another player also takes advantage of your choice of role.&#10;&#10;UPC 655132003018&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/-DOqixs8uwKUvvWPKI4f9w__original/img/Vh-DCkTPa8OU45LaJdUywwhiYqE=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5261714.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/-DOqixs8uwKUvvWPKI4f9w__thumb/img/xLs-ldTPwaADbvzkOpF0sgWzwck=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5261714.jpg
77	231733	Obsession	You are the head of a respected but troubled family estate in mid-19th century Victorian England. After several lean decades, family fortunes are looking up! Your goal is to improve your estate so as to be in better standing with the truly influential families in Derbyshire.&#10;&#10;Obsession is a game of 16 to 20 turns in which players build a deck of Victorian gentry (British social upper class), renovate their estate by acquiring building tiles from a centralized builders' market, and manipulate an extensive service staff of butlers, housekeepers, underbutlers, maids, valets, and footmen utilizing a novel worker placement mechanic. Successfully hosting prestigious social activities such as Fox Hunts, Music Recitals, Billiards, Political Debates, and Grand Balls increases a player's wealth, reputation, and connections among the elite.&#10;&#10;Each turn, players choose a building tile representing a room or outdoor space in and around their 19th century British country house. The tile chosen dictates the event that can be hosted and the guests to be invited. Players must carefully plan, however, to have the proper staff available to service the event and support guests as needed. The reward for success is new investment opportunities, permitting further renovation of the estate (acquisition of more valuable/powerful building tiles), an increase in reputation in the county, an expanding circle of influential acquaintances, and a larger and highly-trained domestic staff.&#10;&#10;Throughout the game, a competitive courtship for the hand of the most eligible young gentleman and lady in the county presents specific renovation and reputation objectives. The player who best meets these objectives while accumulating victory points will win the hand of the wealthy love interest and the game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;	\N	1	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/sy89BiuZXfbSnG7Cag9tBQ__original/img/uArsqbWyUALa982zGWsy8QQWnjE=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic5902073.png	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/sy89BiuZXfbSnG7Cag9tBQ__thumb/img/eTnMwfCC2jCGDPXC08SIaMXNOTM=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5902073.png
78	72125	Eclipse: New Dawn for the Galaxy	The galaxy has been a peaceful place for many years. After the ruthless Terran&ndash;Hegemony War (30.027&ndash;33.364), much effort has been employed by all major spacefaring species to prevent the terrifying events from repeating themselves. The Galactic Council was formed to enforce precious peace, and it has taken many courageous efforts to prevent the escalation of malicious acts. Nevertheless, tension and discord are growing among the seven major species and in the Council itself. Old alliances are shattering, and hasty diplomatic treaties are made in secrecy. A confrontation of the superpowers seems inevitable &ndash; only the outcome of the galactic conflict remains to be seen. Which faction will emerge victorious and lead the galaxy under its rule?&#10;&#10;A game of Eclipse places you in control of a vast interstellar civilization, competing for success with its rivals.

79	157354	Five Tribes	Crossing into the Land of 1001 Nights, your caravan arrives at the fabled Sultanate of Naqala. The old sultan just died and control of Naqala is up for grabs! The oracles foretold of strangers who would maneuver the Five Tribes to gain influence over the legendary city-state. Will you fulfill the prophecy? Invoke the old Djinns and move the Tribes into position at the right time, and the Sultanate may become yours!&#10;&#10;Designed by Bruno Cathala, Five Tribes builds on a long tradition of German-style games that feature wooden meeples. Here, in a unique twist on the now-standard &quot;worker placement&quot; genre, the game begins with the meeples already in place &ndash; and players must cleverly maneuver them over the villages, markets, oases, and sacred places tiles that make up Naqala. How, when, and where you dis-place these Five Tribes of Assassins, Elders, Builders, Merchants, and Viziers determine your victory or failure.&#10;&#10;As befitting a Days of Wonder game, the rules are straightforward and easy to learn. But devising a winning strategy will take a more calculated approach than our standard fare. You need to carefully consider what moves can score you well and put your opponents at a disadvantage. You need to weigh many different pathways to victory, including the summoning of powerful Djinns that may help your cause as you attempt to control this legendary Sultanate.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/dmo-WD6HZHVUPrbVHunaTw__original/img/PS9HXrThM8Pepbd-cuA1tX8KCYU=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2055255.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/dmo-WD6HZHVUPrbVHunaTw__thumb/img/I6KVJlQgS1GfWDPSWAFNqce4Cgc=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2055255.jpg
80	191189	Aeon's End	The survivors of a long-ago invasion have taken refuge in the forgotten underground city of Gravehold. There, the desperate remnants of society have learned that the energy of the very breaches the beings use to attack them can be repurposed through various gems, transforming the malign energies within into beneficial spells and weapons to aid their last line of defense: the breach mages.&#10;&#10;Aeon's End is a cooperative game that explores the deckbuilding genre with a number of innovative mechanisms, including a variable turn order system that simulates the chaos of an attack, and deck management rules that require careful planning with every discarded card. Players will struggle to defend Gravehold from The Nameless and their hordes using unique abilities, powerful spells, and, most importantly of all, their collective wits.&#10;&#10;	\N	1	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/d50LceHj6LIafa4S_qIsCg__original/img/4MsKNGm47PU9BGW4i2yamMlRSQ0=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3189350.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/d50LceHj6LIafa4S_qIsCg__thumb/img/KMFA-gXm_LbZpyXSAHbIZm-eAcQ=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3189350.jpg
157	103885	Star Wars: X-Wing Miniatures Game	Star Wars: X-Wing Miniatures Game is a tactical ship-to-ship combat game in which players take control of powerful Rebel X-wings and nimble Imperial TIE fighters, facing them against each other in fast-paced space combat. Featuring stunningly detailed and painted miniatures, the X-Wing Miniatures Game recreates exciting Star Wars space combat throughout its several included scenarios. Select your crew, plan your maneuvers, and complete your mission!&#10;&#10;Whatever your chosen vessel, the rules of X-Wing facilitate fast and visceral gameplay that puts you in the middle of Star Wars fiercest firefights. Each ship type has its own unique piloting dial, which is used to secretly select a speed and maneuver each turn. After planning maneuvers, each ship's dial is revealed and executed (starting with the lowest skilled pilot). So whether you rush headlong toward your enemy showering his forward deflectors in laser fire, or dance away from him as you attempt to acquire a targeting lock, you'll be in total control throughout all the tense dogfighting action.&#10;&#10;Star Wars: X-Wing features (three) unique missions, and each has its own set of victory conditions and special rules; with such a broad selection of missions, only clever and versatile pilots employing a range of tactics will emerge victorious. What's more, no mission will ever play the same way twice, thanks to a range of customization options, varied maneuvers, and possible combat outcomes. Damage, for example, is determined through dice and applied in the form of a shuffled Damage Deck. For some hits your fighter sustains, you'll draw a card that assigns a special handicap. Was your targeting computer damaged, affecting your ability to acquire a lock on the enemy? Perhaps an ill-timed weapon malfunction will limit your offensive capabilities. Or worse yet, your pilot could be injured, compromising his ability to focus on the life-and-death struggle in which he is engaged...&#10;&#10;The Star Wars: X-Wing starter set includes everything you need to begin your battles, such as scenarios, cards, and fully assembled and painted ships. What's more, Star Wars: X-Wing's quick-to-learn ruleset establishes the foundation for a system that can be expanded with your favorite ships and characters from the Star Wars universe.&#10;&#10;Reimplemented by Star Wars: X-Wing (Second Edition)&#10;&#10;	\N	2	2	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/yNqgVxaqoZepir7Hzkfe-Q__original/img/H6rYWOhYjT_PXTrvHKyX6FEt-vw=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1603292.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/yNqgVxaqoZepir7Hzkfe-Q__thumb/img/idalbLcUm2q9yxVZzRDkLEax5AE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1603292.jpg
323	97903	Terror in Meeple City	In Terror in Meeple City (formerly known as Rampage), you arrive in Meeple City as a gigantic, famished, scaly-skinned monster! Your goal: Dig your claws and dirty paws into the asphalt, destroy buildings, and devour innocent meeples &ndash; in short: sow terror while having fun. The monster who has caused the most damage after the carnage finally ends wins the game.&#10;&#10;The buildings in Meeple City are comprised of floor tiles and meeples, with the meeples serving as pillars that support the floors. Four wooden vehicles are on the ground in the eight neighborhoods in the city. Each monster, which consists of a wooden paws disc and a wooden body, starts in one corner of the game board. On a turn you take two actions from four possibilities, repeating an action if desired:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Move: Pick up your monster body, flick the paws disc, then place the body back on the disc.&#10;    Demolish: If your paws are on the sidewalk surrounding a building, you can pick up your monster body, drop it onto a building, then collect any floors that have no meeples on them.&#10;    Toss a vehicle: If you're in a neighborhood with a vehicle, you can pick up the vehicle, place it on your body, then flick the vehicle at a building or another monster.&#10;    Breathe: Even while away from sidewalks with no vehicles, you can cause destruction by placing your chin on your monster's body and blowing across the board.&#10;&#10;&#10;Monsters tend to be messy when obtaining meals, but if you knock meeples off the city board, you might be punished for letting food go to waste, costing you a tooth or letting other players take an additional action. After your two actions, you can eat unprotected meeples on the ground in your neighborhood, but you can eat only as many as the number of teeth you have. If you knock another monster to the ground, you break off one of its teeth, thereby keeping it from stealing your food! Meeples come in six colors, with the colors representing different types of inhabitants: blue (journalists), green (military), yellow (blondes), grey (old people), red (heroes), and black (businessmen). For each set of six you collect in your stomach, you score 10 points at game's end. You score points for collecting floors and teeth, too, and you can also score for achieving the goal on your character card.&#10;&#10;In addition to the character card, each player has a power card and a superpower card unique to his monster, with the former lasting the entire game and the latter being a one-shot effect that's revealed only upon use.&#10;&#10;Terror in Meeple City includes rules for monsters that evolve over the course of the game, that lose points for meeples not in sets, and that want to combine two game boards to allow for play with up to eight players.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/loyFNu06XcKcRcoouNkn5Q__original/img/Dg5JwmmkDHJ4b4WDAU7WREHbBdw=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2482302.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/loyFNu06XcKcRcoouNkn5Q__thumb/img/w5H9B8agVcPdAfNYgvN1qoFjLsc=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2482302.jpg
81	201808	Clank!: A Deck-Building Adventure	Burgle your way to adventure in the deck-building board game Clank! Sneak into an angry dragon's mountain lair to steal precious artifacts. Delve deeper to find more valuable loot. Acquire cards for your deck and watch your thievish abilities grow.&#10;&#10;Be quick and be quiet. One false step and CLANK! Each careless sound draws the attention of the dragon, and each artifact stolen increases its rage. You can enjoy your plunder only if you make it out of the depths alive!&#10;&#10;Clank! is a deck-building game. Each player has their own deck, and building yours up is part of playing the game. You start each of your turns with five cards in your hand, and you'll play them all in any order you choose. Most cards will generate resources, of which there are three different kinds:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Skill, which is used to acquire new cards for your deck.&#10;    Swords, which are used to fight the monsters that infest the dungeon.&#10;    Boots, which are used to move around the board.&#10;&#10;&#10;Every time you acquire a new card, you put it face up in your discard pile. Whenever you need to draw a card and find your deck empty, you shuffle your discard pile and turn it face down to form a new deck. With each shuffle, your newest cards become part of a bigger and better deck! Each player starts with the same cards in their deck, but they&rsquo;ll acquire different cards during their turns. Because cards can do many different things, each player&rsquo;s deck (and strategy) will become more and more different as the game unfolds.&#10;&#10;During the game, you have two goals:&#10;&#10;    Retrieve an Artifact token and escape the dragon by returning to the place you started, outside of the dungeon.&#10;    Accumulate enough points with your Artifact and other loot to beat out your opponents and earn the title of Greatest Thief in the Realm!&#10;&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/DPjV1iI0ygo5Bl3XLNRiIg__original/img/cXqOdM3BLyIeRt0GP3M3V--gF1M=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4449526.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/DPjV1iI0ygo5Bl3XLNRiIg__thumb/img/O2WnqJew5gNjQqPUH3gqmTBc1pQ=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4449526.jpg
82	159675	Fields of Arle	Welcome to Arle&#10;In Fields of Arle, created by Uwe Rosenberg, one to two players live as farmers in the small and peaceful town of Arle in East Frisia. The flax grown in the land surrounding the village makes it a profitable place to work and live. Fields of Arle takes players through four and a half years of this era of prosperity, with different opportunities available as the seasons change. Farm the land to capitalize on the demand for flax, or find other ways to make the most of the small town&rsquo;s prosperity.&#10;&#10;Work the Land&#10;Whether you delve into flax farming or leverage other areas of expertise, always make sure that you have the land to build up your village. Construct dikes to keep the waters at bay and expand your fields. Dry out bogs to harvest peat and then clear the land for cultivation. Create more fields for your livestock, buildings, or future crops; after that, you can decide whether to house animals or cultivate a forest for timber. Perhaps you&rsquo;d like to take up some flax farming for yourself, or diversify and try out a little bit of everything.&#10;&#10;Tools of the Trade&#10;At the outset of each half year, you&rsquo;ll choose how you&rsquo;d like to spend that time working. There are many ways to build your fortune. Use the Master space to increase the tools at your disposal, focus on the Cattle Trainer to make the most of your livestock, or build up your fleet of vehicles and ship out goods. Taking stock of your progress differs depending on the season. You may milk your existing livestock or care for a bunch of newborn animals. You could harvest your flax in the fall, and sheer your sheep in spring. At the end of each half year, you&rsquo;ll need to take stock of your progress by unloading your vehicles and feeding your family and animals, so keep an eye on the season and do your best to keep the farm growing and everyone well fed!&#10;&#10;Travel and Prosper&#10;Once you&rsquo;ve made headway in clearing fields and stocking up goods, it's time to make your products available to potential buyers. The more vehicles you have, the more goods you can ship. Send things into the wide world to increase your Travel Experience and grant you points over the course of the four and a half years of the game. Build up your farm and your vehicles and get your goods out into the world to make the most of every season. There are many roads to success in Fields of Arle, so pick your path, work the land, and enjoy the friendly competition as you strive to make your fortune!&#10;&#10;- from the publisher's website&#10;&#10;	\N	1	2	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/0w8go6cfvlpgJKydHUkDtA__original/img/322N77t8F7uTev-U_WCqX5uqmEE=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic2225968.png	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/0w8go6cfvlpgJKydHUkDtA__thumb/img/0z1o-kU2xYwmVO8oNszdt1V4K54=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2225968.png

Strategize, accrue wealth, gain the favour of the gods, and become the builder of the magnificent Pyramid of the Sun.&#10;&#10;In Teotihuacan: City of Gods, each player commands a force of worker dice, which grow in strength with every move. On your turn, you move a worker around a modular board, always choosing one of two areas of the location tile you land on: one offering you an action (and a worker upgrade), the other providing you with a powerful bonus (but without an upgrade).&#10;&#10;While managing their workforce and resources, players develop new technologies, climb the steps of the three great temples, build houses for the inhabitants of the city, and raise the legendary and breath-taking Pyramid of the Sun in the center of the city.&#10;&#10;Each game is played in three eras. As the dawn of the Aztecs comes closer, player efforts (and their ability to feed their workforce) are evaluated a total of three times.

84	25613	Through the Ages: A Story of Civilization	Through the Ages is a civilization building game. Each player attempts to build the best civilization through careful resource management, discovering new technologies, electing the right leaders, building wonders and maintaining a strong military. Weakness in any area can be exploited by your opponents. The game takes place throughout the ages beginning in the age of antiquity and ending in the modern age.&#10;&#10;One of the primary mechanisms in TTA is card drafting. Technologies, wonders, and leaders come into play and become easier to draft the longer they are in play. In order to use a technology you will need enough science to discover it, enough food to create a population to man it and enough resources (ore) to build the building to use it. While balancing the resources needed to advance your technology you also need to build a military. Military is built in the same way as civilian buildings. Players that have a weak military will be preyed upon by other players. There is no map in the game so you cannot lose territory, but players with higher military will steal resources, science, kill leaders, take population or culture. It is very difficult to win with a large military, but it is very easy to lose because of a weak one.&#10;&#10;Victory is achieved by the player whose nation has the most culture at the end of the modern age.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/3piN3YX4WmBRuIvbEG2Ygg__original/img/9it-9V5tij-EnowN_pLXQgl6k7c=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic236169.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/3piN3YX4WmBRuIvbEG2Ygg__thumb/img/TDXIygWwAHKc2o90uGnnAhIa7_4=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic236169.jpg

To succeed in War Chest, you must successfully manage not only your armies on the battlefield, but those that are waiting to be deployed.&#10;&#10;Each round you draw three unit coins from your bag, then take turns using them to perform actions. Each coin shows a military unit on one side and can be used for one of several actions.

85	317985	Beyond the Sun	Beyond the Sun is a space civilization game in which players collectively decide the technological progress of humankind at the dawn of the Spacefaring Era, while competing against each other to be the leading faction in economic development, science, and galactic influence.&#10;&#10;The game is played over a variable number of rounds until a number of game-end achievements are collectively claimed by the players. The winner is the faction with the most victory points, which are obtained by researching technologies, improving their economy, controlling and colonizing systems, and completing various achievements and events throughout the game.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player moves their action pawn to an empty action space, then takes that action. They then conduct their production phase, either producing ore, growing their population, or trading one of those resources for another. Finally, they can claim up to one achievement, if possible.&#10;&#10;As players take actions, they research new technologies that come in four levels. Each technology is one of four types (scientific, economic, military, commercial), and higher-level technologies must match one of the types of tech that lead into it. Thus, players create their own technology tree in each game, using these actions to increase their military strength, to jump to different habitable exoplanetary systems, to colonize those systems, to boost their resource production, to develop android tech that allows growth without population, and more.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/BfEHqHQAvZLbRX7y7e9TWg__original/img/h2NEwLqn5mNkcEfMdP_8oMWa9KE=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5617866.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/BfEHqHQAvZLbRX7y7e9TWg__thumb/img/6rZLxebQyTXasbAPddxpdE1LVls=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5617866.jpg

Through your agents, you recruit adventurers to go on quests on your behalf, earning rewards and increasing your influence over the city. Expand the city by purchasing new buildings that open up new actions on the board, and hinder &ndash; or help &ndash; the other lords by playing Intrigue cards to enact your carefully laid plans.&#10;&#10;During the course of play, you may gain points or resources through completing quests, constructing buildings, playing intrigue cards or having other players utilize the buildings you have constructed.

87	171623	The Voyages of Marco Polo	In 1271, 17-year-old Marco Polo started on a journey to China with his father and older brother. After a long and grueling journey that led through Jerusalem and Mesopotamia and over the &quot;Silk Road&quot;, they reached the court of Kublai Khan in 1275.&#10;&#10;In The Voyages of Marco Polo, players recreate this journey, with each player having a different character from history with a special power in the game. The game is played over five rounds. Each round, the players roll their five personal dice and can perform one action each turn with them. Each action requires the use of one or more dice, and can be collecting resources or money, acquiring contracts or traveling on the board. When traveling, each player begins at Venice and can decide between several routes eastward, all the way to Beijing. When a player stops at a city, they place a trading post there, giving them access to extra actions or resources for the rest of the game. The higher the value of the dice used for an action, the better the options that may be chosen, but also the more money the player must pay if an opponent has already chosen the same action.&#10;&#10;After five rounds, the game ends with players receiving extra victory points for having trading posts in Beijing, fulfilling the most orders, and having trading posts in the cities on secret city cards that each player gets at the start of the game.&#10;&#10;This game should not be confused with Marco Polo Expedition, which has the same German title.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/n1G7_aWToLAAB7Mqt8iwyA__original/img/VQddnfi_QO0r4GmUU3M8_-nuO3Q=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic2461346.png	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/n1G7_aWToLAAB7Mqt8iwyA__thumb/img/qfEgrXBN5L1EeMQ91siw6r_OoL4=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2461346.png
88	62219	Dominant Species	90,000 B.C. &mdash; A great ice age is fast approaching. Another titanic struggle for global supremacy has unwittingly commenced between the varying animal species. &#10;Dominant Species is a game that abstractly recreates a tiny portion of ancient history: the ponderous encroachment of an ice age and what that entails for the living creatures trying to adapt to the slowly-changing earth. &#10;Each player will assume the role of one of six major animal classes&mdash;mammal, reptile, bird, amphibian, arachnid, or insect. Each begins the game more or less in a state of natural balance in relation to one another. But that won&rsquo;t last: It is indeed &quot;survival of the fittest&quot;.&#10;Through wily action pawn placement, players will strive to become dominant on as many different terrain tiles as possible in order to claim powerful card effects. Players will also want to propagate their individual species in order to earn victory points for their particular animal. Players will be aided in these endeavors via speciation, migration, and adaptation actions, among others. &#10;All of this eventually leads to the end game&mdash;the final ascent of the ice age&mdash;where the player having accumulated the most victory points will have his animal crowned the Dominant Species. &#10;But somebody better become dominant quickly, because it&rsquo;s getting mighty cold...&#10;&#10;Game Play&#10;The large hexagonal tiles are used throughout the game to create an ever-expanding interpretation of earth as it might have appeared a thousand centuries ago. The smaller tundra tiles will be placed atop the larger tiles&mdash;converting them into tundra in the process&mdash;as the ice age encroaches.&#10;The cylindrical action pawns (or &quot;AP&quot;s) drive the game. Each AP will allow a player to perform the various actions that can be taken, such as speciation, environmental change, migration, or glaciation. After being placed on the action display during the Planning Phase, an AP will trigger that particular action for the owning player during the Execution Phase.&#10;Generally, players will be trying to enhance their own animal&rsquo;s survivability while simultaneously trying to hinder that of their opponents&rsquo;&mdash;hopefully collecting valuable victory points (or &quot;VP&quot;s) along the way. The various cards will aid in these efforts, giving players useful one-time abilities or an opportunity for recurring VP gains.&#10;Throughout the game, species cubes will be added to, moved about in, and removed from the tiles in play (the &quot;earth&quot;). Element disks will be added to and removed from both animals and earth. &#10;When the game ends, players will conduct a final scoring of each tile&mdash;after which the player controlling the animal with the highest VP total wins.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	6	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/oeygRZntjNUJWvc8SxDfww__original/img/U-WjAGlPXS_p89z4R0V4b8IADxA=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic784193.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/oeygRZntjNUJWvc8SxDfww__thumb/img/PUmSkY6ZKL81b6YuP1U59R3VdRE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic784193.jpg

179	287954	Azul: Summer Pavilion	At the turn of the 16th Century, King Manuel I commissioned Portugal's greatest artisans to construct grandiose buildings. After completing the Palaces of Evora and Sintra, the king sought to build a summer pavilion to honor the most famous members of the royal family. This construction was intended for the most talented artisans &mdash; whose skills meet the splendor that the royal family deserves. Sadly, King Manuel I died before construction ever began.&#10;&#10;In Azul: Summer Pavilion, players return to Portugal to accomplish the task that never began. As a master artisan, you must use the finest materials to create the summer pavilion while carefully avoiding wasting supplies. Only the best will rise to the challenge to honor the Portuguese royal family.&#10;&#10;Azul: Summer Pavilion lasts six rounds, and in each round players draft tiles, then place them on their individual player board to score points. Each of the six colors of tiles is wild during one of the rounds.&#10;&#10;At the start of each round, draw tiles at random from the bag to refill each of the five, seven, or nine factories with four tiles each. Draw tiles as needed to refill the ten supply spaces on the central scoring board. Players then take turns drafting tiles. You can choose to take all of the tiles of a non-wild color on a factory and place them next to your board; if any wild tiles are on this factory, you must take one of them. Place all remaining tiles in the center of the table. Alternatively, you can take all tiles of a non-wild color from the center of play; you must also take one wild tile, if present.&#10;&#10;After all tiles have been claimed, players then take turns placing tiles on their individual boards. Each board depicts seven stars that would be composed of six tiles; each space on a star shows a number from 1-6, and six of the stars are for tiles of a single color while the seventh will be composed of one tile of each color. To place a tile on the blue 5, for example, you must discard five blue or wild tiles from next to your player board (with at least one blue being required), placing one blue tile in the blue 5 space and the rest in the discard tower. You score 1 point for this tile and 1 point for each tile within this star connected to the newly placed tile.&#10;&#10;If you completely surround a pillar, statue, or window on your game board with tiles, you get an immediate bonus, taking 1-3 tiles from the central supply spaces and placing them next to your board. At the end of the round, you can carry over at most four tiles to the next round; discard any others, losing 1 point for each such tile.&#10;&#10;After six rounds, you score a bonus for each of the seven stars that you've filled completely. Additionally, you score a bonus for having covered all seven spaces of value 1, 2, 3 or 4. You lose 1 point for each remaining tile unused, then whoever has the most points wins.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/843kZ6WR0HfyXWEybA6L7A__original/img/VtYGvhy_YCSw14FpV8FGzv0eMe4=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4930887.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/843kZ6WR0HfyXWEybA6L7A__thumb/img/sOiQSPo_DM7G1Om0PF1T2Z8ACcA=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4930887.jpg
90	68448	7 Wonders	You are the leader of one of the 7 great cities of the Ancient World. Gather resources, develop commercial routes, and affirm your military supremacy. Build your city and erect an architectural wonder which will transcend future times.&#10;&#10;7 Wonders lasts three ages. In each age, players receive seven cards from a particular deck, choose one of those cards, then pass the remainder to an adjacent player. Players reveal their cards simultaneously, paying resources if needed or collecting resources or interacting with other players in various ways. (Players have individual boards with special powers on which to organize their cards, and the boards are double-sided). Each player then chooses another card from the deck they were passed, and the process repeats until players have six cards in play from that age. After three ages, the game ends.&#10;&#10;In essence, 7 Wonders is a card development game. Some cards have immediate effects, while others provide bonuses or upgrades later in the game. Some cards provide discounts on future purchases. Some provide military strength to overpower your neighbors and others give nothing but victory points. Each card is played immediately after being drafted, so you'll know which cards your neighbor is receiving and how her choices might affect what you've already built up. Cards are passed left-right-left over the three ages, so you need to keep an eye on the neighbors in both directions.&#10;&#10;Though the box of earlier editions is listed as being for 3&ndash;7 players, there is an official 2-player variant included in the instructions.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	7	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/35h9Za_JvMMMtx_92kT0Jg__original/img/jt70jJDZ1y1FWJs4ZQf5FI8APVY=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic7149798.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/35h9Za_JvMMMtx_92kT0Jg__thumb/img/BUOso8b0M1aUOkU80FWlhE8uuxc=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7149798.jpg
91	279537	The Search for Planet X	At the edge of our solar system, a dark planet may lurk. In 2015, astronomers estimated a large distant planet could explain the unique orbits of dwarf planets and other objects. Since then, astronomers have been scanning the sky, hoping to find this planet.&#10;&#10;In The Search for Planet X, players take on the role of astronomers who use observations and logical deductions to search for this hypothetical planet. Each game, the companion app randomly selects an arrangement of objects and a location for Planet X following predefined logic rules.&#10;&#10;Each round, as the earth travels around the sun, players use the app to perform scans and attend conferences. As they gain information about the location of the objects, they mark that information on their deduction sheets. As players learn the locations of the various objects, they can start publishing theories, which is how players score points.&#10;&#10;As more and more objects are found, players narrow down the possible locations for Planet X. Once a player believes they know its location and the objects on either side of it, they use the app to conduct a search. The game ends when a player successfully locates Planet X, and all players have a final chance to score some additional points.&#10;&#10;The Search for Planet X captures the thrill of discovery, the puzzle-y nature of astronomical investigation, and the competition inherent in the scientific process. Can you be the first to find Planet X?&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;	\N	1	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/NItjtztEUAKOpaTWZddu9A__original/img/fr-JmerGdiEj6r9UM7F6laogGF0=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5744928.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/NItjtztEUAKOpaTWZddu9A__thumb/img/x8YD4cAVOAbSDsZbmKgU0-WQ9wI=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5744928.jpg

A deep, branching storyline allows you to tackle problems in different ways, ensuring no two games play alike. Difficult decisions or harrowing choices wait behind every corner and seemingly minor tasks may reverberate with major long-term consequences.&#10;&#10;In a land slowly sinking into the Wyrdness and torn apart by con&#239;&#172;&#130;ict; surviving each day is a challenge on its own. Starvation, sickness, violent weather, and random incidents all conspire to end your journey. Guardian Menhirs, that ensured safe travel throughout the realm, are slowly going dark turning simple logistics into an involving puzzle. To overcome these challenges, your character develops along several con&#239;&#172;&#130;icting lines, such as Brutality / Empathy or Practicality / Spirituality. These traits unlock a rich choice of mutually exclusive skills and lead to di&#239;&#172;&#128;erent deck-building strategies, making character advancement meaningful and deep.&#10;&#10;The character you develop is going to be tested during dozens of combat and non-combat encounters. Sometimes you will need to brute force your way, but often diplomacy might be a better option. Regardless whether you fight with your strength or your wits, our unique dice-less encounter system makes resolving each con&#239;&#172;&#130;ict fun and exciting, while keeping you immersed in the game.&#10;&#10;In Avalon, there&rsquo;s a legend waiting behind every stone and every tree.

As you slowly put all the pieces of the larger puzzle together, the land will always have a surprise waiting for you just around the corner. Many secrets can be discovered only after several games. Created by one of the best polish fantasy authors, Krzysztof Piskorski, the story of Tainted Grail: the Fall of Avalon aims to push the boundaries of non-linear narrative, building upon the rich experience.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;	\N	1	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/aAwBzPzta4joKfFZt05hCw__original/img/e1HfD3XIvObNuGH6rq7kUSK-5aQ=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4385726.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/aAwBzPzta4joKfFZt05hCw__thumb/img/zvV21ZaydrMSEbbYSNXcmw3WmfY=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4385726.jpg
93	93	El Grande	In this award-winning game, players take on the roles of Grandes in medieval Spain.  The king's power is flagging, and these powerful lords are vying for control of the various regions.  To that end, you draft caballeros (knights in the form of colored cubes) into your court and subsequently move them onto the board to help seize control of regions.  After every third round, the regions are scored, and after the ninth round, the player with the most points is the winner.&#10;&#10;In each of the nine rounds, you select one of your 13 power cards to determine turn order as well as the number of caballeros you get to move from the provinces (general supply) into your court (personal supply).&#10;&#10;A turn then consists of selecting one of five action cards which allow variations to the rules and additional scoring opportunities in addition to determining how many caballeros to move from your court to one or more of the regions on the board (or into the castillo - a secretive tower). Normally, you may only place your caballeros into regions adjacent to the one containing the king pawn. The one hard and fast rule in El Grande is that nothing may move into or out of the king's region. One of the five action cards that is always available each round allows you to move the king to a new region. The other four action cards varying from round to round.&#10;&#10;The goal is to have a caballero majority in as many regions (and the castillo) as possible during a scoring round. Following the scoring of the castillo, you place any cubes you had stashed there into the region you had secretly indicated on your region dial. Each region is then scored individually according to a table printed in that region. Two-point bonuses are awarded for having sole majority in the region containing your Grande (large cube) and in the region containing the king.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	5	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/GO282hlXR3RiknU5W4GZjg__original/img/TCTXvYRQGWMAngXuHZcIXRknfpc=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic5373572.png	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/GO282hlXR3RiknU5W4GZjg__thumb/img/3mn0EVxxfT94rit8VHiyEYztGeg=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5373572.png
94	236457	Architects of the West Kingdom	Architects of the West Kingdom is set at the end of the Carolingian Empire, circa 850 AD. As royal architects, players compete to impress their King and maintain their noble status by constructing various landmarks throughout his newly appointed domain. Players need to collect raw materials, hire apprentices, and keep a watchful eye on their workforce. These are treacherous times, and rival architects will stop at nothing to slow your progress. Will you remain virtuous, or be found in the company of thieves and black marketeers?&#10;&#10;The aim of Architects of the West Kingdom is to be the player with the most victory points (VP) at game's end. Points are gained by constructing various buildings and advancing work on the Archbishop's cathedral. Throughout the game, players need to make a lot of moral decisions. However, only at game's end will their virtue be judged. A few underhand deals here and there might not seem like much, but fall too far and you will be punished. The game ends once a set number of constructions have been completed.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;	\N	1	5	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/OAX7HfOz-9N60StgADzd0g__original/img/x2Y_DYWrzzleMETfnu7Jm3R8jPo=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic3781944.png	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/OAX7HfOz-9N60StgADzd0g__thumb/img/sBMaoJ-Kz74lJ6djcl-NNMTr0Wo=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3781944.png

96	37111	Battlestar Galactica: The Board Game	Battlestar Galactica: The Board Game is an exciting game of mistrust, intrigue, and the struggle for survival. Based on the epic and widely-acclaimed Sci Fi Channel series, Battlestar Galactica: The Board Game puts players in the role of one of ten of their favorite characters from the show. Each playable character has their own abilities and weaknesses, and must all work together in order for humanity to have any hope of survival. However, one or more players in every game secretly side with the Cylons. Players must attempt to expose the traitor while fuel shortages, food contaminations, and political unrest threatens to tear the fleet apart.&#10;&#10;After the Cylon attack on the Colonies, the battered remnants of the human race are on the run, constantly searching for the next signpost on the road to Earth. They face the threat of Cylon attack from without, and treachery and crisis from within. Humanity must work together if they are to have any hope of survival&hellip;but how can they, when any of them may, in fact, be a Cylon agent?&#10;&#10;Battlestar Galactica: The Board Game is a semi-cooperative game for 3-6 players ages 10 and up that can be played in 2-3 hours. Players choose from pilots, political leaders, military leaders, or engineers to crew Galactica. They are also dealt a loyalty card at the start of the game to determine if they are a human or Cylon along with an assortment of skill cards based on their characters abilities. Players then can move and take actions either on Galactica, on Colonial 1, or in a Viper. They need to collect skill cards, fend off Cylon ships, and keep Galactica and the fleet jumping. Each turn also brings a Crisis Card, various tasks that players must overcome. Players need to play matching skill cards to fend off the problems; skill cards that don't match hinder the players success. Fate could be working against the crew, or there could be a traitorous Cylon! As players get closer and closer towards reaching their Earth, another round of loyalty cards are passed out and more Cylons may turn up. If players can keep their up their food stores, fuel levels, ship morale, and population, and they can keep Galactica in one piece long enough to make it to Earth, the Humans win the game. But if the Cylon players reveal themselves at the right moment and bring down Galactica, the Humans have lost.&#10;&#10;Official Site, Rules &amp; FAQ: http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_minisite_sec.asp?eidm=18&amp;esem=4&#10;Unofficial FAQ for really tricky questions: http://boardgamegeek.com/wiki/page/Battlestar_Galactica_FAQ&#10;&#10;	\N	3	6	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/5Q2w2rFJiFI_uV89KP6ECg__original/img/MYuRAKLRAGlIQTph2XKWjzqT7sQ=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic354500.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/5Q2w2rFJiFI_uV89KP6ECg__thumb/img/s1BljxEdoxQ1zGYiw05Qa9rg9hI=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic354500.jpg
97	225694	Decrypto	Players compete in two teams in Decrypto, with each trying to correctly interpret the coded messages presented to them by their teammates while cracking the codes they intercept from the opposing team.&#10;&#10;In more detail, each team has their own screen, and in this screen they tuck four cards in pockets numbered 1-4, letting everyone on the same team see the words on these cards while hiding the words from the opposing team. In the first round, each team does the following: One team member takes a code card that shows three of the digits 1-4 in some order, e.g., 4-2-1. They then give a coded message that their teammates must use to guess this code. For example, if the team's four words are &quot;pig&quot;, &quot;candy&quot;, &quot;tent&quot;, and &quot;son&quot;, then I might say &quot;Sam-striped-pink&quot; and hope that my teammates can correctly map those words to 4-2-1. If they guess correctly, great; if not, we receive a black mark of failure.&#10;&#10;Starting in the second round, a member of each team must again give a clue about their words to match a numbered code. If I get 2-4-3, I might now say, &quot;sucker-prince-stake&quot;. The other team then attempts to guess our numbered code. If they're correct, they receive a white mark of success; if not, then my team must guess the number correctly or take a black mark of failure. (Guessing correctly does nothing except avoid failure and give the opposing team information about what our hidden words might be.)&#10;&#10;The rounds continue until a team collects either its second white mark (winning the game) or its second black mark (losing the game). Games typically last between 4-7 rounds. If neither team has won after eight rounds, then each team must attempt to guess the other team's words; whichever team guesses more words correctly wins.&#10;&#10;	\N	3	8	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/hHZWXnUTMYDd_KTAM6Jwlw__original/img/lL6QJ69UmZT7CeljUcjyA47b-e0=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3759421.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/hHZWXnUTMYDd_KTAM6Jwlw__thumb/img/O5XHaPOALYquS058qcXWVm5b_k4=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3759421.jpg
98	155821	Inis	Inis is a game deeply rooted in Celtic history and lore in which players win by being elected King of the Island (Inis). Players can try to achieve one of three different victory conditions:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Leadership: Be the leader &mdash; i.e., have more clan figures than any other player &mdash; of territories containing at least six opponents' clans.&#10;     Land: Have your clans present in at least six different territories.&#10;     Religion: Have your clans present in territories that collectively contain at least six sanctuaries.&#10;&#10;&#10;Over the course of the game, players also earn deeds, typically chanted by bards or engraved by master crafters, that reduce by one the magic total of six for any condition. While one victory condition is enough to claim the title of King, a game of experienced players usually has a tight balance of power, emphasizing the leadership of the capital of the island.&#10;&#10;At the start of each round, players draft a hand of four action cards (with 13 action cards for three players and 17 for four players) during the Assembly. Action cards not played at the end of one season are not held for the next. Players also have access to leader cards for the territories that allow it and where they were elected leader during the assembly. Each Assembly reallocates those cards. Finally, they collect &quot;epic tales&quot; cards that depict the deeds of the ancient Irish gods and heroes, like Cuchulainn, the Dagda, Lugh and many others. These will be kept and used to inspire the clans and achieve extraordinary feats...under the right circumstances. The cards provide a variety of actions: adding clans, moving clans, building/exploring, and special actions.&#10;&#10;Careful drafting, hand management, bluffing (especially once players understand the importance of passing their turn), good timing, and a precise understanding of the balance of power are the keys to victory. After a discovery game you'll be ready for a full and epic game, where an undisputed player will be king by the Assembly for his merit and wisdom.&#10;&#10;While Inis has &quot;dudes&quot; that are &quot;on a map&quot;, it's a beginner's mistake to play this as a battle game because eliminating other clans reduces your chances of scoring a Leadership victory condition. Peace among different clans, with or without a clear territory leader, is the usual outcome of a clan's movement. Battles will occur, of course, as the Celtic clans can be unruly and a good player will listen to his clan's people (i.e., his hand of cards). That battle aspect is reflected in the clan's miniatures representing warriors. Woodsmen, shepherds and traders complete the set of twelve minis for each player; these occupations have no impact on the game, but give it flavor.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/6QE8mnPFmauoj2THsyUYPA__original/img/6bZdn1SNbpIqU7n5pwtncvdNE_U=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4739757.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/6QE8mnPFmauoj2THsyUYPA__thumb/img/m63hnvHi6jqlva52FGaWbEqzjys=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4739757.jpg
99	122515	Keyflower	Keyflower is a game for two to six players played over four rounds. Each round represents a season: spring, summer, autumn, and finally winter. Each player starts the game with a &quot;home&quot; tile and an initial team of eight workers, each of which is colored red, yellow, or blue. Workers of matching colors are used by the players to bid for tiles to add to their villages. Matching workers may alternatively be used to generate resources, skills and additional workers, not only from the player's own tiles, but also from the tiles in the other players' villages and from the new tiles being auctioned.&#10;&#10;In spring, summer and autumn, more workers will arrive on board the Keyflower and her sister boats, with some of these workers possessing skills in the working of the key resources of iron, stone and wood. In each of these seasons, village tiles are set out at random for auction. In the winter no new workers arrive and the players select the village tiles for auction from those they received at the beginning of the game. Each winter village tile offers VPs for certain combinations of resources, skills and workers. The player whose village and workers generate the most VPs wins the game.&#10;&#10;Keyflower presents players with many different challenges and each game will be different due to the mix of village tiles that appear in that particular game. Throughout the game, players will need to be alert to the opportunities to best utilize their various resources, transport and upgrade capability, skills and workers.&#10;&#10;Keyflower, a joint design between Richard Breese and Sebastian Bleasdale, is the seventh game in the &quot;Key&quot; series from R&amp;D Games set in the medieval &quot;Key&quot; land.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	6	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/HbfgxDJZQnNEZQKvpmJxQg__original/img/HsrtfanhKfXX07zNEm-xZpSbxyY=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2278942.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/HbfgxDJZQnNEZQKvpmJxQg__thumb/img/5t1MtJEDdhSgtyJlmu3Hu1qR_ZQ=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2278942.jpg
100	170042	Raiders of the North Sea	Raiders of the North Sea is set in the central years of the Viking Age. As Viking warriors, players seek to impress the Chieftain by raiding unsuspecting settlements. To do so, players need to assemble a crew, collect provisions, and journey north to plunder gold, iron and livestock. Glory can be found in battle, even at the hands of the Valkyrie, so gather your warriors because it's raiding season!&#10;&#10;To impress the Chieftain, you need victory points (VPs), with those being acquired primarily by raiding settlements, taking plunder, and making offerings to the Chieftain. How you use your plunder is also vital to your success. Players take turns in clockwise order, and on a turn you place a worker and resolve its action, then pick up a different worker and resolve its action. Broadly speaking, those actions fall in one of two categories:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Work: Having a good crew and enough provisions are vital to successful raiding, so before making any raids, players need to do some work to prepare their crew and collect supplies. This is all done in the village at the bottom of the game board, with eight buildings offering various actions. You must first place your worker in an available building where no other worker is present, then pick up a different worker from a different building.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Raid: Once players have hired enough crew and collected provisions, you may choose to raid on your turn. To raid a settlement &mdash; whether a harbor, outpost, monastery or fortress &mdash; you need to meet three requirements: Having a large enough crew, having enough provisions (along with gold for monasteries and fortresses, and having a worker of the right color. Raiding offers various ways of scoring, such as military strength, plunder, and Valkyries, which is how grey and white workers enter the game.&#10;&#10;&#10;The game ends when only one fortress raid remains, all Valkyrie have been removed, or all offerings have been made, then players tally their scores.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/hXdfAhgZ8OeyWLunt36wlw__original/img/f5wjooKB2dGPBlBzws5cDsuuJ-k=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3578101.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/hXdfAhgZ8OeyWLunt36wlw__thumb/img/vh7ttK5C_kKf5YZNYOY4vfsgXHU=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3578101.jpg

101	163068	Trickerion: Legends of Illusion	Trickerion is a competitive Euro-style strategy game set in a fictional world inspired by the late 19th century urban life and culture, spiced with a pinch of supernatural.&#10;&#10;Players take on the roles of rival stage illusionists, each with their own strengths and characteristics. They are striving for fortune and fame in a competition hosted by a legendary magician, looking for a successor worthy of the mighty Trickerion Stone, which is fabled to grant supernatural power to its owner.&#10;&#10;Using worker placement and simultaneous action selection mechanisms, the Illusionists and their teams of helpers &mdash; the Engineer, the Assistant, the Manager, and a handful of Apprentices &ndash; obtain blueprints and components for increasingly complex magic tricks, expand the team and set up performances by visiting the Downtown, Dark Alley, Market Row and Theater locations on the main game board depicting a late 19th century cityscape.&#10;&#10;The tricks are stored and prepared on the Magician's own Workshop game board, while the performances themselves take place at the Theater in the form of a tile placement mini-game with lots of player interaction. The performances yield Fame points and Coins to their owners based on the tricks they consist of. Fame points have multiple uses, but they also serve as a win condition - After turn 7, when the last Performance card is revealed, the game ends and the illusionist with the most Fame points wins.&#10;&#10;The game offers 48 different Tricks to be learned from the Optical, Spiritual, Mechanical and Escape categories, over 90 character abilities, and 40 Special Assignment cards that influence the actions taken at the various game locations. The base game can be expanded with two optional rule modules to add further strategic depth to the game.&#10;&#10;The &quot;Dark Alley&quot; expansion included in the base game adds a new location to the game. It also comes with 48 new Special Assignment cards, a new tier of Tricks, and 27 Prophecy tokens that can alter certain game rules turn by turn, giving the game additional variety.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/9gob752VqEklQFV_gz16hw__original/img/ivQUea2qrHp2TDLM4i7gp1123vQ=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic2585510.png	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/9gob752VqEklQFV_gz16hw__thumb/img/C2GPhkDu7fWK6L64MTOaYVRCgS4=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2585510.png
102	18602	Caylus	Once upon a time ...&#10;1289. To strengthen the borders of the Kingdom of France, King Philip the Fair decided to have a new castle built. For the time being, Caylus is but a humble village, but soon, workers and craftsmen will be flocking by the cartload, attracted by the great prospects. Around the building site, a city is slowly rising up.&#10;&#10;The players embody master builders. By building the King's castle and developing the city around it, they earn prestige points and gain the King's favor. When the castle is finished, the player who has earned the most prestige wins the game.  The expansion Caylus Expansion: The Jeweller was included in the 2nd Edition.&#10;&#10;Each turn, players pay to place their workers in various buildings in the village. These buildings allow players to gather resources or money, or to build or upgrade buildings with those resources. Players can also use their resources to help build the castle itself, earning points and favors from the king, which provide larger bonuses. Building a building provides some immediate points, and potentially income throughout the game, since players receive bonuses when others use their buildings. The buildings chosen by the players have a heavy impact on the course of the game, since they determine the actions that will be available to all the players.&#10;&#10;As new buildings are built, they stretch along a road stretching away from the castle, and not all buildings can be used every turn. Players have some control over which buildings are active by paying to influence the movement of the Provost marker. The final position of the marker is the newest building that can be used that turn. The Provost marker also helps determine the movement of the Bailiff marker, which determines the end of the game. Generally, if players are building many buildings and the Provost is generous in allowing them to be used, the game ends more quickly.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	5	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/yC7nOSc1x5PT-oNnh6TEcQ__original/img/ugJgRdFpYSsb5Pj1NDk76q6LKTo=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1638795.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/yC7nOSc1x5PT-oNnh6TEcQ__thumb/img/ec9AK_e7FTbxy9tA8er2wW4UnqA=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1638795.jpg
103	42	Tigris & Euphrates	Regarded by many as Reiner Knizia's masterpiece, Tigris &amp; Euphrates is set in the ancient fertile crescent with players building civilizations through tile placement. Players are given four different leaders: farming, trading, religion, and government. The leaders are used to collect victory points in these same categories. However, your score at the end of the game is the number of points in your weakest category, which encourages players not to get overly specialized. Conflict arises when civilizations connect on the board, i.e., external conflicts, with only one leader of each type surviving such a conflict. Leaders can also be replaced within a civilization through internal conflicts.&#10;&#10;Starting in the Mayfair edition from 2008, Tigris &amp; Euphrates included a double-sided game board and extra components for playing an advanced version of the game. This &quot;ziggurat expansion&quot;, initially released as a separate item in Germany for those who already owned the base game, is a special monument that extends across five spaces of the board. The monument can be built if a player has a cross of five civilization tokens of the same color by discarding those five tokens and replacing them with the ziggurat markers, placing a ziggurat tower upon the middle tile. The five ziggurat markers cannot be destroyed. All rules regarding monuments apply to the ziggurat monument as well. If your king is inside the kingdom of the ziggurat, you will get one victory point in a color of your choice at the end of your turn.&#10;&#10;Some versions of Tigris &amp; Euphrates are listed as being for 2-4 players, while others incorrectly state that they're for 3-4 players. Tigris &amp; Euphrates is part of what is sometimes called Reiner Knizia's tile-laying trilogy.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/soAzNVWglCdVBacNjoCTJw__original/img/HClVZy9phFP-NPte4UBQpclsaHU=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2338267.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/soAzNVWglCdVBacNjoCTJw__thumb/img/0UPEyOaSFyqEH1ikrSig_218RQ0=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2338267.jpg
104	40834	Dominion: Intrigue	In Dominion: Intrigue (as with Dominion), each player starts with an identical, very small deck of cards. In the center of the table is a selection of other cards the players can &quot;buy&quot; as they can afford them. Through their selection of cards to buy, and how they play their hands as they draw them, the players construct their deck on the fly, striving for the most efficient path to the precious victory points by game end.&#10;&#10;From the back of the box: &quot;Something&rsquo;s afoot. The steward smiles at you like he has a secret, or like he thinks you have a secret, or like you think he thinks you have a secret. There are secret plots brewing, you&rsquo;re sure of it. At the very least, there are yours. A passing servant murmurs, &ldquo;The eggs are on the plate.&rdquo; You frantically search your codebook for the translation before realizing he means that breakfast is ready. Excellent. Everything is going according to plan.&quot;&#10;&#10;Dominion: Intrigue adds rules for playing with up to 8 players at two tables or for playing a single game with up to 6 players when combined with Dominion. This game adds 25 new Kingdom cards and a complete set of Treasure and Victory cards. The game can be played alone by players experienced in Dominion or with the basic game of Dominion.&#10;&#10;Part of the Dominion series.&#10;&#10;Integrates with:&#10;&#10;    Dominion&#10;&#10;&#10;Also released as an expansion that requires the base game or card set to play: Dominion: Die Intrige &#226;&#128;&#147; Erweiterung.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	6	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/OGOmpi0GgwOwH2y28QgkuA__original/img/VHMKsFZvoK2KKGZiLyoKZb_YhNQ=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic460011.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/OGOmpi0GgwOwH2y28QgkuA__thumb/img/jnSHqOXWLN3PfdpCtnfjf44oTsA=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic460011.jpg
324	343562	Horrified: American Monsters	Horrified: American Monsters is a standalone game that features gameplay similar to 2019's Horrified, which challenges players to overcome the &quot;Universal Monsters&quot; from classic films.&#10;&#10;In this co-operative game, you face off against classic American nightmarish beasts: Bigfoot, Mothman, the Jersey Devil, the Chupacabra, the Banshee of the Badlands, and the Ozark Howler. The more creatures in the game, the harder the challenge, with players needing to use their unique powers to figure out how to defeat each monster.&#10;&#10;	\N	1	5	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ZEnq2aZr_CQDovhCV2wGuQ__original/img/5iNjtlVcElNir9Rm82yXPSEoXhM=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic6306248.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ZEnq2aZr_CQDovhCV2wGuQ__thumb/img/lNt2WebfakzIqxVqNByylA1z2R0=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6306248.jpg
105	172386	Mombasa	In Mombasa, players acquire shares of chartered companies based in Mombasa, Cape Town, Saint-Louis, and Cairo and spread their trading posts throughout the African continent in order to earn the most money.&#10;&#10;&quot;As I expected, the East African Company's network of trading posts has spread far into the West. They were even able to expand into a couple of diamond mines. It seems reasonable to invest our recent yield here in Mombasa, rather than to continue our unrivalled commitment in Cape Town. After all, it can only be to our advantage to have other irons in the fire. And when the day of reckoning comes, it will show whether our hoarding of holdings and our intransigent eagerness are worth it...&quot;&#10;&#10;Mombasa is a tense Euro-style strategy game set in 18th century Africa in which players invest in four chartered companies. Using influence to help them expand across the continent improves the value of the players' shares in these companies. Players will also trade in bananas, coffee or cotton, work together with diamond merchants and ensure that the accounts are kept up to date. To make the most of this one will need to have the correct action cards (back) in hand at the same time, which needs excellent forward planning.&#10;&#10;Mombasa features a unique, rotating-display hand-mechanism that drives game play: Players start with an identical hand, but acquire new and more powerful cards from the rotating display throughout the game. Each round players choose action cards from their hand, place them face down in the so-called action slot (beneath the player board), and then reveal them simultaneously to carry out the actions. At the end of the action phase, each card is moved to the so-called resting slot (above the player board). Cards in the resting slots are inactive and cannot be used until they are recovered - each round one can only return cards of one resting slot which is why it can make quite a difference in which action slots certain cards are placed.&#10;&#10;The game ends after seven rounds, players add up their scores in different categories, and the player with the highest score (who has earned the most money) wins the game. With a variety of paths to victory and double-sided company boards, each game will be a new and different challenge.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/VceWk5QVkgIp6rWDl5qHKQ__original/img/8lLnp9nod-NhjaoUobcZ3vvb7Mg=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2611318.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/VceWk5QVkgIp6rWDl5qHKQ__thumb/img/_4ZkvkgZey9R2OJOw_TqF426Qew=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2611318.jpg
106	203993	Lorenzo il Magnifico	Lorenzo de' Medici, also known as &quot;Lorenzo il Magnifico&quot; (Lorenzo the Magnificent), was one of the most powerful and enthusiastic patrons of the Italian Renaissance.&#10;&#10;In Lorenzo il Magnifico, each player takes the role of the head of a noble family in a city during the Italian Renaissance to gain more prestige and fame &mdash; that is, victory points (VP) &mdash; than anyone else. To do so, you send your family members to different areas of town, where they can obtain many achievements. In one location, they get useful resources; in another development cards that represent newly conquered territories, sponsored buildings, influenced characters, or encouraged ventures; and somewhere else they activate the effects of their cards.&#10;&#10;Family members are not identical. At the beginning of each round, you roll three dice to determine their value. You must choose carefully where to send your most valuable family members...&#10;&#10;You can gain VP in several ways, and you must also pay attention to your relations with the Church. The game is divided into three periods, each formed by two rounds; at the end of each period, players must show their faith, and whoever hasn't prayed enough will suffer hard penalties. After six rounds, you calculate your final score, and the player with the most VP wins.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/8G6GkImjt0F_L5aYb8fmtQ__original/img/dOiPu4wGisyuw3KxDketwCSpOfY=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3175535.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/8G6GkImjt0F_L5aYb8fmtQ__thumb/img/MoUo5LUThQh7CyxGX6QnPBM5zAo=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3175535.jpg
107	146021	Eldritch Horror	Across the globe, ancient evil is stirring. Now, you and your trusted circle of colleagues must travel around the world, working against all odds to hold back the approaching horror. Foul monsters, brutal encounters, and obscure mysteries will take you to your limit and beyond. All the while, you and your fellow investigators must unravel the otherworldy mysteries scattered around the globe in order to push back the gathering mayhem that threatens to overwhelm humanity. The end draws near! Do you have the courage to prevent global destruction?&#10;&#10;Eldritch Horror is a co-operative game of terror and adventure in which one to eight players take the roles of globetrotting investigators working to solve mysteries, gather clues, and protect the world from an Ancient One &ndash; that is, an elder being intent on destroying our world. Each Ancient One comes with its own unique decks of Mystery and Research cards, which draw you deeper into the lore surrounding each loathsome creature. Discover the true name of Azathoth or battle Cthulhu on the high seas.&#10;&#10;While the tasks on these Mystery cards (along with the locations of otherworldly gates, menacing monsters, and helpful clues) will often inform both your travel plans and the dangers you confront, you can find adventure anywhere in the world...even where you least expect it. It is during the Encounter Phase of each turn that players resolve combat or, alternatively, build their investigators' personal stories by reading an encounter narrative from one of several types of Encounter cards. You might go head to head with a monster in Istanbul or find yourself in a tough spot with the crime syndicate in a major city. Maybe you will embark on an expedition to the Pyramids or research a clue you uncover in the unnamed wilderness. You may even find your way through a gate and explore a dimension beyond time and space.&#10;&#10;Should you fail an encounter, the cost is steep. If you are fortunate, you will merely incur physical or mental trauma. However, you might also be compelled to take a Condition card, which represents a specific injury or restriction gained throughout your journey, such as a Leg Injury or Amnesia. You could find yourself getting in over your head to acquire assets and receive a Debt condition &ndash; or maybe you'll owe a favor to something far more insidious than a debt collector, and enter into a Dark Pact! Whatever your condition, you would be wise to find a resolution with haste; many conditions have a &quot;reckoning effect&quot; which, if triggered, ensure a much more sinister fate.&#10;&#10;All the while, the arrival of the Ancient One approaches. Its malign influence is manifested in Eldritch Horror as you draw Mythos Cards, which govern the appearance of otherworldly gates, fearsome monsters, and other ominous elements. Mythos cards keep your investigators under pressure, introducing new threats, even as the arrival of the Great Old One draws nearer! Since the investigators draw a new Mythos card each round, they're certain to have their hands full battling foul creatures and following up on strange rumors, even as they work to solve their three all-important mysteries.&#10;&#10;With twelve unique investigators, two hundred-fifty tokens, and over three hundred cards, Eldritch Horror presents an epic, world-spanning adventure with each and every game.&#10;&#10;	\N	1	8	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/oxdsZKIX5_3ovDo38EIaeg__original/img/vxK08kQAEn5qPbejK2CUTyWOsig=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1872452.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/oxdsZKIX5_3ovDo38EIaeg__thumb/img/I1oCwOcGxAOVx2VE2LcXuKWoLvY=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1872452.jpg
108	73439	Troyes	In Troyes (pronounced &quot;troah&quot;), players recreate four centuries of history of this famous city of the Champagne region of France. Each player manages their segment of the population (represented by a horde of dice) and their hand of cards, which represent the three primary domains of the city:  religious, military, and civil. Players can also offer cash to their opponents' populace in order to get a little moonlighting out of them &mdash; anything for more fame!&#10;&#10;Make your underlings:&#10;&#10;&#10;     work on the cathedral&#10;     combat misfortune&#10;     bustle about the city&#10;     and other such tasks that are below your family's stature&#10;&#10;&#10;&bull;&bull;&bull;&#10;&#10;Many editions of Troyes released in 2016 or later include rules for a solo variant as well as four bonus cards originally released in 2011 as a promotional item.

251	939	Star Wars: The Queen's Gambit	Based on the four battles at the end of Star Wars Episode One: The Phantom Menace -- the battle on the plain between the Gungan forces and the droid army; the attempt by Naboo forces, led by Queen Amidala, to storm the palace and capture the Trade Federation viceroys; the fight between Darth Maul and the two Jedi Knights; and the space battle in which Anakin's starfighter destroyed the Droid Control Ship.&#10;&#10;The forces are represented by 155 plastic miniatures on three separate boards, including a three-level palace.  The action is driven by two decks of cards for each side.  Each turn, each side simultaneously chooses four action cards from a hand of ten, and places them in order.  The actions are then carried out one at a time, alternating sides.  Combat is resolved using special attack and defense dice.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/bz5nHaO3qAqNRKV4jketEQ__original/img/eI3t4FN52ZIun4RATOzqDvuRhP4=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic35506.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/bz5nHaO3qAqNRKV4jketEQ__thumb/img/NX6F33Zk93mJFnP6gwlxsdKHh_0=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic35506.jpg
110	256916	Concordia Venus	Concordia Venus is a standalone reimplementation of Concordia with some added features.&#10;&#10;Concordia Venus is a peaceful strategy game of economic development in Roman times for 2-6 players aged 13 and up. Instead of looking to the luck of dice or cards, players must rely on their strategic abilities. Be sure to watch your rivals to determine which goals they are pursuing and where you can outpace them! In the game, colonists are sent out from Rome to settle down in cities that produce bricks, food, tools, wine, and cloth. Each player starts with an identical set of playing cards and acquires more cards during the game. These cards serve two purposes:&#10;&#10;They allow a player to choose actions during the game.&#10;They are worth victory points (VPs) at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;Concordia is a strategy game that requires advance planning and consideration of your opponent's moves. Every game is different, not only because of the sequence of new cards on sale but also due to the modular layout of cities on the 4 different maps included with the game. When all cards have been sold from the market or after the first player builds his 15th house, the game ends. The player with the most VPs from the gods (Jupiter, Saturnus, Mercurius, Minerva, Vesta, Venus, etc.) wins the game.&#10;&#10;&#10;     Teams of two players each may play against each other.&#10;     New personality cards with the goddess Venus allow for new strategies.&#10;     New maps (Cyprus, Hellas, Ionium) on which to play in addition to the classic Imperium map.&#10;&#10;&#10;Note: This entry is for the standalone game Concordia Venus.

111	12493	Twilight Imperium: Third Edition	Twilight Imperium Third Edition is an epic empire-building game of interstellar conflict, trade, and struggle for power. Players take the roles of ancient galactic civilizations, each seeking to seize the imperial throne via warfare, diplomacy, and technological progression. With geomorphic board tiles, exquisite plastic miniatures, hundreds of cards, and introducing a rich set of strategic dimensions that allows each player to refocus their game-plan, the original designer (Christian T. Petersen) has seamlessly incorporated the better qualities of other recently popular games to improve on the game-play of the original TI, making it at once perfectly well-rounded and pleasantly familiar to experienced gamers.&#10;&#10;TI3 is played by at least three players who belong to ten possible alien races, each with their own advantages and quirks. The 'designer notes' in the rulebook candidly and humbly acknowledge the inspiration for some of the improvements to the original game. The strategic game-play borrows the governing element from Puerto Rico to involve players in an iteratively complex and yet fast-paced game experience with very little downtime. The game map, basic player progress and overall victory are dynamically determined in almost exactly the same way as they are by imaginative players of CATAN, while the &quot;Command&quot; system cleverly improves on the 'oil' logistical mechanism of Attack! to both manage turn-based activity and limit the size of armies, uniquely enabling weakened players to bounce back if they play their cards right.&#10;&#10;Part of the Twilight Imperium Series.&#10;&#10;Re-implements:&#10;&#10;    Twilight Imperium: Second Edition&#10;&#10;&#10;Expanded by:&#10;&#10;    Twilight Imperium: Third Edition &#226;&#128;&#147; Shattered Empire&#10;    Twilight Imperium: Third Edition &#226;&#128;&#147; Shards of the Throne&#10;&#10;&#10;Re-implemented in:&#10;&#10;    Twilight Imperium: Fourth Edition&#10;&#10;&#10;	\N	3	6	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/MHeQQrbauUVsvh2QF6PMog__original/img/LfjXNSzbVuSmMfcRYwGcuZwFHZo=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4128153.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/MHeQQrbauUVsvh2QF6PMog__thumb/img/9dc8SjfrB38KrNsuHd_JZOXnwYk=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4128153.jpg
112	144733	Russian Railroads	In Russian Railroads, players compete in an exciting race to build the largest and most advanced railway network. In order to do so, the players appoint their workers to various important tasks.&#10;&#10;The development of simple tracks will quickly bring the players to important places, while the modernization of their railway network will improve the efficiency of their machinery. Newer locomotives cover greater distances and factories churn out improved technology. Engineers, when used effectively, can be the extra boost that an empire needs to race past the competition.&#10;&#10;There are many paths to victory: Who will ride into the future full steam ahead and who will be run off the rails? Whose empire will overcome the challenges ahead and emerge victorious?&#10;&#10;&#10;Game Summary&#10;Each player has their own board, with space for factories, and 3 rail tracks (to 3 different cities). On each track, use a track token to mark the progression of your rails (different colored marker for each type or rail). Some interesting twists:&#10;- The different track types must be built in a specific order (black, gray, brown, natural, white). Later tracks may never be advanced further on the track than the earlier tracks.&#10;- On each track, as the track head advances, you cross several thresholds that provide awards: the ability to start a new color of track, victory points, bonus tiles, etc.&#10;- Each track line can have one (two for the first rail) engine(s) associated with it; the size of the loco(s) determines how far down the track you actually score VP.&#10;&#10;The central board has (almost) all the locations for placing workers. Each location requires 1-3 workers (of one player; played all together). Players, who start the game with 5 workers (or 6 workers, in 2-3 player games), will take turns using a location. These provide a variety of abilities, for example:&#10;- advance 1 or more track heads by 1-3 spaces&#10;- acquire an engine or factory; engines are allocated to rail lines, while factories (the reverse side of the tile) are placed on your factory line.&#10;- earn 2 coins&#10;- take 2 temporary workers&#10;- jump ahead in turn order&#10;- acquire an engineer, which has a unique power and becomes a worker-placement location only for you&#10;&#10;Each round ends when all players have passed on placing/using workers. Then, score VP for each track and factory line. On each track line, only spaces as far down the track as the loco level will score. Each track type scores VP for every space from its track head back to where the next color of track starts. Track types built earlier (e.g. black) score less/space than later tracks (e.g., white). On each factory line the position of the purple industry marker(s) show how many VP are scored.&#10;&#10;After 7 rounds (or 6 rounds, in 2-3 player games), the game ends; most VP wins!&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/B0oEVgeqs4_rT8oyb1_Juw__original/img/EnBmUkDKSbcBusI6nVRczadYs0M=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1772936.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/B0oEVgeqs4_rT8oyb1_Juw__thumb/img/oZkHYUMtcGVwg_gz6OjtuiD3vmU=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1772936.jpg
113	163412	Patchwork	In Patchwork, two players compete to build the most aesthetic (and high-scoring) patchwork quilt on a personal 9x9 game board. To start play, lay out all of the patches at random in a circle and place a marker directly clockwise of the 2-1 patch. Each player takes five buttons &mdash; the currency/points in the game &mdash; and someone is chosen as the start player.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player either purchases one of the three patches standing clockwise of the spool or passes. To purchase a patch, you pay the cost in buttons shown on the patch, move the spool to that patch's location in the circle, add the patch to your game board, then advance your time token on the time track a number of spaces equal to the time shown on the patch. You're free to place the patch anywhere on your board that doesn't overlap other patches, but you probably want to fit things together as tightly as possible. If your time token is behind or on top of the other player's time token, then you take another turn; otherwise the opponent now goes. Instead of purchasing a patch, you can choose to pass; to do this, you move your time token to the space immediately in front of the opponent's time token, then take one button from the bank for each space you moved.&#10;&#10;In addition to a button cost and time cost, each patch also features 0-3 buttons, and when you move your time token past a button on the time track, you earn &quot;button income&quot;: sum the number of buttons depicted on your personal game board, then take this many buttons from the bank.&#10;&#10;What's more, the time track depicts five 1x1 patches on it, and during set-up you place five actual 1x1 patches on these spaces. Whoever first passes a patch on the time track claims this patch and immediately places it on his game board.&#10;&#10;Additionally, the first player to completely fill in a 7x7 square on his game board earns a bonus tile worth 7 extra points at the end of the game. (Of course, this doesn't happen in every game.)&#10;&#10;When a player takes an action that moves his time token to the central square of the time track, he takes one final button income from the bank. Once both players are in the center, the game ends and scoring takes place. Each player scores one point per button in his possession, then loses two points for each empty square on his game board. Scores can be negative. The player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	2	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/wLW7pFn0--20lEizEz5p3A__original/img/B1j7R-slq8wxgC71Sg1F7S1s7Kg=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2270442.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/wLW7pFn0--20lEizEz5p3A__thumb/img/P49TUiytgjmRAtKsfO7Y3yU_xic=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2270442.jpg
114	102680	Trajan	Set in ancient Rome, Trajan is a development game in which players try to increase their influence and power in various areas of Roman life such as political influence, trading, military dominion and other important parts of Roman culture.&#10;&#10;The central mechanism of the game uses a system similar to that in Mancala or pit-and-pebbles games. In Trajan, a player has six possible actions: building, trading, taking tiles from the forum, using the military, influencing the Senate, and placing Trajan tiles on his tableau.&#10;&#10;At the start of the game, each player has two differently colored pieces in each of the six sections (bowls) of his tableau. On a turn, the player picks up all the pieces in one bowl and distributes them one-by-one in bowls in a clockwise order. Wherever the final piece is placed, the player takes the action associated with that bowl; in addition, if the colored pieces in that bowl match the colors shown on a Trajan tile next to the bowl (with tiles being placed at the start of the game and through later actions), then the player takes the additional action shown on that tile.&#10;&#10;What are you trying to do with these actions? Acquire victory points (VPs) in whatever ways are available to you &ndash; and since this is a Feld design, you try to avoid being punished, too. At the Forum you try to anticipate the demands of the public so that you can supply them what they want and not suffer a penalty. In the Senate you acquire influence which translates into votes on VP-related laws, ideally snagging a law that fits your long-term plans. With the military, you take control of regions in Europe, earning more points for those regions far from Rome.&#10;&#10;All game components are language neutral, and the playing time is 30 minutes per player.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/djdeCr__iNV5rMnGnxNiaQ__original/img/-pxFp0FHDLLZK_hMT5kHG7IAQ7M=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic4336095.png	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/djdeCr__iNV5rMnGnxNiaQ__thumb/img/jULoayRVuV3c8cRqKOPsf7oMO5w=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4336095.png
493	156546	Monikers	Monikers is a party game based on the public domain game Celebrities, where players take turns attempting to get their teammates to guess names by describing or imitating well-known people.&#10;&#10;In the first round, clue givers can say anything they want, except for the name itself.

115	310873	Carnegie	Carnegie was inspired by the life of Andrew Carnegie who was born in Scotland in 1835. Andrew Carnegie and his parents emigrated to the United States in 1848. Although he started his career as a telegraphist, his role as one of the major players in the rise of the United States&rsquo; steel industry made him one of the richest men in the world and an icon of the American dream.&#10;&#10;Andrew Carnegie was also a benefactor and philanthropist; upon his death in 1919, more than $350 million of his wealth was bequeathed to various foundations, with another $30 million going to various charities. His endowments created nearly 2,500 free public libraries that bear his name: the Carnegie Libraries.&#10;&#10;During the game you will recruit and manage employees, expand your business, invest in real estate, produce and sell goods, and create transport chains across the United States; you may even work with important personalities of the era. Perhaps you will even become an illustrious benefactor who contributes to the greatness of his country through deeds and generosity!&#10;&#10;The game takes place over 20 rounds; players will each have one turn per round. On each turn, the active player will choose one of four actions, which the other players may follow.&#10;&#10;The goal of the game is to build the most prestigious company, as symbolized by victory points.&#10;&emsp;&#10;&mdash;description from publisher&#10;&#10;	\N	1	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/0qxz9DRRhsJrIW1TJ-kz0w__original/img/PzsJsCLfGGo4IG3v43VPvH_etPw=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5710736.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/0qxz9DRRhsJrIW1TJ-kz0w__thumb/img/ma4yc5wbMVrfbg9r21-LxGVwRKw=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5710736.jpg
116	205896	Rising Sun	The great and forgotten Kami have returned from the underworld, displeased with the affairs of the Empire&rsquo;s present Sh&#197;&#141;gun. At the start of spring in the Great New Year, the Kami have gathered their sacred clans with one quest: reclaim the lands of Nippon and return them to their honorable, spiritual traditions. However, each clan is bound by their own proud traditions to a unique vision for this great return and must wage a powerful diplomatic war across eight provinces. Alliances must be forged, betrayal is inevitable, honorable standing rises and falls. Political mandates must be navigated and devastating war must be fought, each won by expert skill and cunning negotiation. And only one may stand victorious at the coming of winter. You, honorable Sh&#197;&#141;gun, lead one of these great clans. Do you have the strength of honor, virtue, and spirit, as well as the mastery of steel necessary to deliver on this ancient promise?&#10;&#10;Rising  Sun is a board game for 3 to 5 players set in legendary feudal Japan. Each player chooses a Clan and competes to lead theirs to victory by accumulating Victory Points over the course of the Seasons. Each Clan possesses a unique ability and differs in Seasonal Income, Starting Honor Rank, and Home Province.&#10;Over the course of the game, players will forge and break alliances, choose political actions, worship the gods, customize their clans, and position their figures around Japan. In the process, Honor is a palpable element in Rising Sun: Having high Honor gives several advantages, while having low Honor may grant the allegiance of the darker elements of the world. But above all, Honor settles all disputes: Whenever there is a tie, the tied player with the highest Honor wins.&#10;&#10;In Rising  Sun, players are encouraged to use diplomacy, negotiation, and even bribery to further their cause. Players can make deals at any point in the game but no deals are truly binding.&#10;Victory Points can be gained in several ways, from winning battles, to harvesting the right provinces, to playing to the Virtues accumulated by your Clan.&#10;&#10;The game is played over the course of 4 rounds or Seasons: Spring, Summer, and then Autumn; when  Winter  comes,  the  game  draws to a close and players calculate bonuses to decide who is the winner. &#10;Each Season is divided into five phases: &#10;1) Seasonal Setup because every Season has a certain Season deck with different cards, &#10;2) Tea Ceremony in which players sit down and negotiate their Alliances for the Season, &#10;3) Political Phase during which players will select Political Mandates to prepare their Clans and position their forces,&#10;4) War Phase, during which players battle over several Provinces, and &#10;5) Seasonal Cleanup.&#10;&#10;As already mentioned, the start of the Winter Season signifies the end of the game. Peace falls over the land as it gets covered in white snow, and a new Emperor will rise under the power of the great Kami.&#10;&#10;	\N	3	5	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/iwevA6XmiNLHn1QnGUucqw__original/img/pKJ1XyLN4hvHim5eRj2VJHijv1E=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3880340.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/iwevA6XmiNLHn1QnGUucqw__thumb/img/UNKv6MWzJUAwhhP7-ng6HoinRa8=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3880340.jpg

You want a bigger and more pleasant kingdom, with more rivers and a wider variety of trees. You want a Dominion! In all directions lie fiefs, freeholds, and feodums. All are small bits of land, controlled by petty lords and verging on anarchy. You will bring civilization to these people, uniting them under your banner.&#10;&#10;But wait! It must be something in the air; several other monarchs have had the exact same idea. You must race to get as much of the unclaimed land as possible, fending them off along the way.

Your parents wouldn't be proud, but your grandparents, on your mother's side, would be delighted.&quot;&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the back of the box&#10;&#10;In Dominion, each player starts with an identical, very small deck of cards.  In the center of the table is a selection of other cards the players can &quot;buy&quot; as they can afford them.  Through their selection of cards to buy, and how they play their hands as they draw them, the players construct their deck on the fly, striving for the most efficient path to the precious victory points by game end.&#10;&#10;Dominion is not a CCG, but the play of the game is similar to the construction and play of a CCG deck. The game comes with 500 cards.

While doing so, distributing purified water and developing railways will help you slow the spread of diseases in this new version of Pandemic.&#10;&#10;Discover a unique part of the world during a historically significant time period: the construction of the first railroad in the Iberian Peninsula during the Spring of Nations.&#10;&#10;The game comes with two variants that can be added :&#10;&#10;     Influx of Patients : the cubes, representing patients, will tend to flock to hospitals to try to get cured. Hospitals also are a bit more powerful.&#10;     Historical Diseases : instead of being generic, each disease has a specific power to better represent what it is (Malaria, Cholera, Yellow Fever etc.)&#10;&#10;&#10;Part of the Pandemic series.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	5	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/752GFSJLkyDZikThRM6gqQ__original/img/SMtMEB-rB_l3p_tmTYzAYGx_IkI=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic3000850.png	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/752GFSJLkyDZikThRM6gqQ__thumb/img/ZFIsirWsf8n1HY6fK-zeDYMKE80=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3000850.png
127	43015	Hansa Teutonica	The players act as traders trying to get victory points for building a network of offices, controlling cities, collecting bonus markers, or when other traders use the cities they control. After controlling a line between two cities with your pawns, you can decide to build an office (and maybe also establish control and/or get a bonus marker) or to get a skill improvement from some of the cities.&#10;&#10;Players have to improve their traders' &quot;skills&quot; for the following effects: getting more VP from offices in their network, getting more available action points, increasing the number of available pawns, and getting the right to place pawns and get more special pawns.&#10;&#10;This game appeared originally as Wettstreit der H&auml;ndler at the Hippodice competition.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	5	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/3IkzYcplGfFtVrd3syClHg__original/img/RqYxJUdNXPmHUWrlADIbTf9Bi_g=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic839090.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/3IkzYcplGfFtVrd3syClHg__thumb/img/4350nWgj6kTrn8BWFI6cxvts_E0=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic839090.jpg
128	178900	Codenames	Two rival spymasters know the secret identities of 25 agents. Their teammates know the agents only by their codenames &mdash; single-word labels like &quot;disease&quot;, &quot;Germany&quot;, and &quot;carrot&quot;. Yes, carrot. It's a legitimate codename. Each spymaster wants their team to identify their agents first...without uncovering the assassin by mistake.&#10;&#10;In Codenames, two teams compete to see who can make contact with all of their agents first. Lay out 25 cards, each bearing a single word. The spymasters look at a card showing the identity of each card, then take turns clueing their teammates. A clue consists of a single word and a number, with the number suggesting how many cards in play have some association to the given clue word. The teammates then identify one agent they think is on their team; if they're correct, they can keep guessing up to the stated number of times; if the agent belongs to the opposing team or is an innocent bystander, the team's turn ends; and if they fingered the assassin, they lose the game.&#10;&#10;Spymasters continue giving clues until one team has identified all of their agents or the assassin has removed one team from play.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	8	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/F_KDEu0GjdClml8N7c8Imw__original/img/gcX_EfjsRpB5fI4Ug4XV73G4jGI=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2582929.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/F_KDEu0GjdClml8N7c8Imw__thumb/img/yl8iXxSNwguMeg3KkmfFO9SMVVc=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2582929.jpg
129	175155	Forbidden Stars	The shifting Warp Storms that surround the long lost Herakon Cluster have finally abated, leaving the ancient treasures and planets within this sector open to the rest of the galaxy. Now, the great factions of the galaxy mobilize their fleets and race to establish a foothold. The reward for successful domination surpasses all other concerns, and the price for conquering this sector will be paid in lives.&#10;&#10;Forbidden Stars challenges you and up to three other players to take command of a mighty fighting force: the Ultramarines chapter of Space Marines, the Eldar of Craftworld Iyanden, the Evil Sunz Ork clan, or the World Eaters Warband of the Chaos Space Marines. Each faction offers unique armies and play styles, but your goal remains the same &mdash; to claim the key objectives selected for your faction. These objective tokens are scattered throughout the Herakon Cluster, but your opponents are sure to defend your objectives against you. You need to build massive armies and command them in unending war to best your enemies and claim your objectives. The fight for the Herakon Cluster is brutal and bloody, and either you will stride triumphant over the bodies of your fallen foes &mdash; or they will do the same to you.&#10;&#10;Each round in Forbidden Stars is divided into three phases. In the planning phase, players take turns placing order tokens face down on the separate tiles (systems) that make up the game board; the four types of order tokens that players can place correspond to four types of actions that players can resolve in the second phase of play. In the operations phase, players reveal their tokens to:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Dominate, draining friendly planets of their important resources&#10;     Strategize, purchasing cards that can upgrade their orders and combat abilities&#10;     Deploy, building cities, factories, bastions, and new mobile units&#10;     Advance, moving units and attacking their enemies.&#10;&#10;&#10;The last phase of each round is the refresh phase, during which players profit from the planets they control, reveal event cards to move the impassable Warp Storms, and heal any units wounded in battle.&#10;&#10;Because of the game's three-phase structure, strategy in Forbidden Stars is balanced between short-term bluffing and long-term tactical military action. The game's set-up also poses strategic opportunities. Players start the game by taking turns assembling sections of the Herakon Cluster, placing individual system tiles along with their own starting forces and the enemy objectives that they must defend. This intentional construction, along with the unique domination abilities of the game's four factions, means that players must work to best utilize their own force's strengths while exploiting the weaknesses of their opponents.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/WlvyznYhlYNXMtMbKKu1oA__original/img/AQ1P6PKw7ZW-XTOAFKhCwsnfP0I=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2471359.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/WlvyznYhlYNXMtMbKKu1oA__thumb/img/cudczHrJs0wFKywIHBQ6Fb7D7oY=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2471359.jpg
130	196340	Yokohama	Once Yokohama was just a fishing village, but now at the beginning of the Meiji era it's becoming a harbor open to foreign countries and one of the leading trade cities of Japan. As a result, many Japanese products such as copper and raw silk are collected in Yokohama for export to other countries. At the same time, the city is starting to incorporate foreign technology and culture, with even the streets becoming more modernized. In the shadow of this development was the presence of many Yokohama merchants.&#10;&#10;In YOKOHAMA, each player is a merchant in the Meiji period, trying to gain fame from a successful business, and to do so they need to build a store, broaden their sales channels, learn a variety of techniques, and (of course) respond to trade orders from abroad.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/3edsEXwH21uaO8HXXdD1Dg__original/img/O-03BIpt7yhPbsffYjDwZc68zbQ=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic7745916.png	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/3edsEXwH21uaO8HXXdD1Dg__thumb/img/jUrVfOrsWBIaTRd5F6RKHFOYcaQ=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7745916.png
131	172287	Champions of Midgard	Champions of Midgard is a middleweight, Viking-themed, worker placement game with dice rolling in which players are leaders of Viking clans who have traveled to an embattled Viking harbor town to help defend it against the threat of trolls, draugr, and other mythological Norse beasts. By defeating these epic creatures, players gain glory and the favor of the gods. When the game ends, the player who has earned the most glory earns the title of Jarl and is recognized as a champion of Midgard!&#10;&#10;Placing workers allows for the collection of resources and warriors, which players may then send on journeys to neighboring villages or across the sea to defeat monsters and gain the glory they need for victory. Resources are used to carve runes, build ships, and feed your followers. Viking warriors (custom dice) do battle with the myriad enemies the town faces.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/VJwOnMF5vwJg2Yaq6ozn3Q__original/img/iEgr80D4UtP0x_WQUYSB60JwGJ0=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2869714.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/VJwOnMF5vwJg2Yaq6ozn3Q__thumb/img/Ms3h8cBxGzfcKB16q1KPOsmnoG8=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2869714.jpg

132	266524	PARKS	PARKS is a celebration of the US National Parks featuring illustrious art from Fifty-Nine Parks.&#10;&#10;In PARKS, players will take on the role of two hikers as they trek through different trails across four seasons of the year. While on the trail, these hikers will take actions and collect memories of the places your hikers visit. These memories are represented by various resource tokens like mountains and forests. Collecting these memories in sets will allow players to trade them in to visit a National Park at the end of each hike.&#10;&#10;Each trail represents one season of the year, and each season, the trails will change and grow steadily longer. The trails, represented by tiles, get shuffled in between each season and laid out anew for the next round. Resources can be tough to come by especially when someone is at the place you&rsquo;re trying to reach! Campfires allow you to share a space and time with other hikers. Canteens and Gear can also be used to improve your access to resources through the game. It&rsquo;ll be tough to manage building up your engine versus spending resources on parks, but we bet you&rsquo;re up to the challenge.

134	263918	Cartographers	Queen Gimnax has ordered the reclamation of the northern lands. As a cartographer in her service, you are sent to map this territory, claiming it for the Kingdom of Nalos. Through official edicts, the queen announces which lands she prizes most, and you will increase your reputation by meeting her demands. But you are not alone in this wilderness. The Dragul contest your claims with their outposts, so you must draw your lines carefully to reduce their influence.

135	30549	Pandemic	In Pandemic, several virulent diseases have broken out simultaneously all over the world! The players are disease-fighting specialists whose mission is to treat disease hotspots while researching cures for each of four plagues before they get out of hand.&#10;&#10;The game board depicts several major population centers on Earth. On each turn, a player can use up to four actions to travel between cities, treat infected populaces, discover a cure, or build a research station. A deck of cards provides the players with these abilities, but sprinkled throughout this deck are Epidemic! cards that accelerate and intensify the diseases' activity. A second, separate deck of cards controls the &quot;normal&quot; spread of the infections.&#10;&#10;Taking a unique role within the team, players must plan their strategy to mesh with their specialists' strengths in order to conquer the diseases. For example, the Operations Expert can build research stations which are needed to find cures for the diseases and which allow for greater mobility between cities; the Scientist needs only four cards of a particular disease to cure it instead of the normal five&mdash;but the diseases are spreading quickly and time is running out. If one or more diseases spreads beyond recovery or if too much time elapses, the players all lose. If they cure the four diseases, they all win!&#10;&#10;The 2013 edition of Pandemic includes two new characters&mdash;the Contingency Planner and the Quarantine Specialist&mdash;not available in earlier editions of the game.&#10;&#10;Pandemic is the first game in the Pandemic series.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/S3ybV1LAp-8SnHIXLLjVqA__original/img/IsrvRLpUV1TEyZsO5rC-btXaPz0=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1534148.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/S3ybV1LAp-8SnHIXLLjVqA__thumb/img/oqViRj6nVxK3m36NluTxU1PZkrk=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1534148.jpg

137	118048	Targi	Unlike in other cultures, the desert Tuareg men, known as Targi, cover their faces whereas women of the tribe do not wear veils. They run the household and they have the last word at home in the tents. Different families are divided into tribes, headed by the &lsquo;Imascheren&rsquo; (or nobles). As leader of a Tuareg tribe, players trade goods from near (such as dates and salt) and far (like pepper), in order to obtain gold and other benefits, and enlarge their family. In each round their new offerings are made. Cards are a means to an end, in order to obtain the popular tribe cards.&#10;&#10;The board consists of a 5x5 grid: a border of 16 squares with printed action symbols and then 9 blank squares in the centre onto which cards are dealt. Meeples are placed one at a time on the spaces at the edges of the board (not including corner squares). You cannot place a meeple on a square the opponent has a meeple on already, nor on a square facing opponent's meeple. Once all meeples are placed, players then execute the actions on the border squares the meeples are on and also take the cards from the centre that match the row and column of the border meeples.&#10;&#10;The game is predominantly scored and won by playing tribal cards to your display. These give advantages during the game and victory points at the end. Usually cards are played (or discarded) immediately once drawn. A single card can be kept in hand but then requires a special action to play it (or to discard it to free the hand spot for another card). Each card has a cost in goods to play. Goods are obtained either from border spaces or from goods cards.&#10;&#10;The display (for scoring) consists of 3 rows of 4 cards that are filled from left to right and cannot be moved once placed (barring some special cards). There is also a balance to be found between the victory point score on the cards themselves (1-3 VP per tribal card) and in the combinations per row (a full row of 4 identical card types gets you an additional 4 VP, and a full row of 4 distinct card types gets you 2 VP).&#10;&#10;The winner at the end of the game is the player with the most victory points.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	2	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/wHg4fOf48cs1kw1PDOk1tQ__original/img/St4ABQhpauYiq4Mt6-f38JtLOjM=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3958793.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/wHg4fOf48cs1kw1PDOk1tQ__thumb/img/6l-jqYlfECK1SVSsUs7FXUheKzQ=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3958793.jpg

139	291453	SCOUT	SCOUT is a ladder-climbing game in which cards have two potential values, players may not rearrange their hand of cards, and players may pass their turn to take a card from the current high set of cards into their hand.&#10;&#10;More specifically, cards are dual-indexed, with different values on each half of the card, with the 45 cards having all possible combinations of the numbers 1-10. During set-up, whoever is shuffling the cards should randomize both the order of the cards in the deck and their orientation. Once each player has been dealt their entire hand of cards, they pick up that hand without rearranging any of the cards; if they wish, they can rotate their entire hand of cards in order to use the values on the other end of each card, but again they cannot rearrange the order of cards in their hand.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player takes one of two actions:&#10;&#10;&bull; Play: A player chooses one or more adjacent cards in their hand that have all the same value or that have values in consecutive order (whether ascending or descending), then they play this set of cards to the table. They can do this only if the table is empty (as on the first turn) or the set they're playing is ranked higher than the set currently on the table; a set is higher if it has more cards or has cards of the same value instead of consecutive cards or has a set of the same quantity and type but with higher values. In this latter case when a player overplays another set, the player captures the cards in this previous set and places them face down in front of themselves.&#10;&#10;&bull; Scout: A player takes a card from either end of the set currently on the table and places it anywhere they wish in their hand in either orientation. Whoever played this previous set receives a 1 VP token as a reward for playing a set that wasn't beaten.&#10;&#10;Once per round, a player can scout, then immediately play.&#10;&#10;When a player has emptied their hand of cards or all but one player have scouted instead of playing, the round ends. Players receive 1 VP for each face-down card, then subtract one point for each card in their hand (except if they were the player scouted repeatedly to end the game). Play as many rounds as the number of players, then whoever has the most points wins.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	5	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/cf0xxkevbwTGF3VUZymKjg__original/img/vkElrRCPJxy7Q3TH9olpq20egA4=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic6398727.png	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/cf0xxkevbwTGF3VUZymKjg__thumb/img/NUcMdmZ3_eA1YfIwL8iRgkZKaHw=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6398727.png

Be unique, as all identical clues will be cancelled!&#10;&#10;A complete game is played over 13 cards. The goal is to get a score as close to 13 as possible.

A desperate fight is taking place every single turn. The invaders build war machines, equip their soldiers, train them and use black magic rituals to achieve victory. Meanwhile, defenders repair walls, build cannons, train soldiers, and do everything they can to hold the castle as long as possible.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/UAjajeqlfHqr2kaoI_sG7Q__original/img/DulqmTmuoo2mPBdRfLLsrt1NJRo=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic570478.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/UAjajeqlfHqr2kaoI_sG7Q__thumb/img/46c93NYdrivup7na34sISos1PVg=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic570478.jpg
142	161970	Alchemists	In Alchemists, two to four budding alchemists compete to discover the secrets of their mystical art. Points can be earned in various ways, but most points are earned by publishing theories &ndash; correct theories, that is &mdash; and therein lies the problem.&#10;&#10;The game is played in six rounds. At the beginning of the round, players choose their play order. Those who choose to play later get more rewards.&#10;Players declare all their actions by placing cubes on the various action spaces, then each action space is evaluated in order. Players gain knowledge by mixing ingredients and testing the results using a smartphone app (iOS, Android, and also Windows) that randomizes the rules of alchemy for each new game. And if the alchemists are longing for something even more special, they can always buy magical artifacts to get an extra push. There are 9 of them (different for each game) and they are not only very powerful, but also very expensive. But money means nothing, when there's academic pride at stake! And the possession of these artifacts will definitely earn you some reputation too. Players can also earn money by selling potions of questionable quality to adventurers, but money is just a means to an end. The alchemists don't want riches, after all. They want respect, and respect usually comes from publishing theories.&#10;&#10;During play, players' reputations will go up and down. After six rounds and a final exhibition, reputation will be converted into points. Points will also be scored for artifacts and grants. Then the secrets of alchemy are revealed and players score points or lose points based on whether their theories were correct. Whoever has the most points at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;Flavor text:&#10;Mandrake root and scorpion tail; spongy mushroom and warty toad &mdash; these are the foundations of the alchemist's livelihood, science, and art.&#10;&#10;But what arcane secrets do these strange ingredients hide? Now it is time to find out. Mix them into potions and drink them to determine their effects &mdash; or play it safe and test the concoction on a helpful assistant! Gain riches selling potions to wandering adventurers and invest these riches in powerful artifacts. As your knowledge grows, so will your reputation, as you publish your theories for all to see. Knowledge, wealth, and fame can all be found in the murky depths of the alchemist's cauldron.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ztNshEv3Fsm46HCJaEOFPw__original/img/SP4ItZ27dLweUPbz_bF7C-P7GtA=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic2241156.png	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ztNshEv3Fsm46HCJaEOFPw__thumb/img/-a0oJ_E49V_7PDW78W7KIyS3rF8=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2241156.png
143	147020	Star Realms	Star Realms is a spaceship combat deck-building game by Magic Hall of Famers Darwin Kastle (The Battle for Hill 218) and Rob Dougherty (Ascension Co-designer).&#10;&#10;Star Realms is a fast paced deck-building card game of outer space combat. It combines the fun of a deck-building game with the interactivity of Trading Card Game style combat. As you play, you make use of Trade to acquire new Ships and Bases from the cards being turned face up in the Trade Row from the Trade Deck. You use the Ships and Bases you acquire to either generate more Trade or to generate Combat to attack your opponent and their bases. When you reduce your opponent&rsquo;s score (called Authority) to zero, you win!&#10;&#10;Multiple decks of Star Realms and/or Star Realms: Colony Wars, one for every two people, allows up to six players to play a variety of scenarios. Also, in the newest version, there are new ways to play that allow up to 6 players with modes like Boss, Hunter, and Free for All. You can also add Star Realms Colony Wars to the deck to make it 4 players. This is the first game of the Star Realms series. When you play Star Realms, you will be able to acquire and use Ships and Bases of any and all of the four factions. Many cards have powerful Ally abilities that reward you for using Ships and Bases of the same faction together, however.&#10;&#10;As you acquire cards using Trade, you put them into your discard pile, to be later shuffled into your personal deck. When you draw Ships, you do what they say and they get placed into your discard pile at the end of your turn. When you draw a Base, you play it face up in front of you and may use its abilities once every turn. In addition to Combat being the way you reduce your opponent&rsquo;s Authority to zero and win the game, it&rsquo;s also useful for destroying your opponent&rsquo;s Bases. Some Bases are designated as Outposts. Your opponent&rsquo;s Outposts must be destroyed before you can use Combat to attack your opponent&rsquo;s Authority directly.&#10;&#10;Star Realms is easy to learn, especially if you&rsquo;re familiar with deck-building games, but it&rsquo;s a game that takes time to master. Each time you play, the game is filled with various strategic decision points. Should I take the best card for me or the best card for my opponent? Should I focus on taking cards of a particular faction or on taking the best card available? Should I be focusing on acquiring more Trade or more Combat? Should I attack my opponent&rsquo;s Base or their Authority? These are just some of the many choices you&rsquo;ll be faced with. New players needn&rsquo;t agonize over these choices just to play, but as they become more advanced players, they will find this depth of strategy leads to great replayability.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	2	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/EsJqPL5CB_TMt0MYL-lnVg__original/img/QXgamCDRuBoRJyU1PQjeh58Pvr8=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1903816.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/EsJqPL5CB_TMt0MYL-lnVg__thumb/img/s_CE1b1XXUnYj9auTPhLrvkNsYA=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1903816.jpg

146	12	Ra	Ra is an auction and set-collection game with an Ancient Egyptian theme.  Each turn players are able to purchase lots of tiles with their bidding tiles (suns).  Once a player has used up his or her suns, the other players continue until they do likewise, which may set up a situation with a single uncontested player bidding on tiles before the end of the round occurs.  Tension builds because the round may end before all players have had a chance to win their three lots for the epoch.  The various tiles either give immediate points, prevent negative points for not having certain types at the end of the round (epoch), or give points after the final round.  The game lasts for three &quot;epochs&quot; (rounds).  The game offers a short learning curve, and experienced players find it both fast-moving and a quick play.&#10;&#10;From the Box:&#10;The game spans 1500 years of Egyptian history in less than an hour!&#10;The players seek to expand their power and fame and there are many ways to accomplish this: Influencing Pharaohs, Building monuments, Farming on the Nile, Paying homage to the Gods, Advancing the technology and culture of the people.

147	127023	Kemet	In Kemet, players each deploy the troops of an Egyptian tribe and use the mystical powers of the gods of ancient Egypt &ndash; along with their powerful armies &ndash; to score points in glorious battles or through invasion of rich territories. A game is typically played to 8 or 10 victory points, which may be accrued through winning attacks, controlling temples, controlling fully-developed pyramids, sacrificing to the gods, and wielding particular magical powers.&#10;&#10;The conquest for the land of Kemet takes place over two phases: Day and Night. During the day, choose an action amongst the nine possible choices provided by your player mat and perform it immediately. Once every player has taken five actions, night falls, with players gathering Prayer Points from their temples, drawing Divine Intervention cards, and determining the turn order before the start of the new day.&#10;&#10;As the game progresses, they can use Prayer Points to acquire power tiles. Some of these enroll magical creatures and have them join their troops. In addition to intimidating enemies, these creatures provide special powers!&#10;&#10;Detailed miniature components represent the combat units and the supernatural creatures that are summoned to enhance them.

149	308765	Praga Caput Regni	Charles IV has been crowned King of Bohemia and ruler of the Holy Roman Empire. From his castle in Prague, he oversees construction of new fortifications: a bridge across the Vltava River, a university, and a cathedral rising within the walls of the castle itself. Prague is already among the largest cities in Europe. King Charles will make it the capital of an empire!&#10;&#10;In Praga Caput Regni, players take the role of wealthy citizens who are organizing various building projects in medieval Prague.

150	304783	Hadrian's Wall	When visiting the North of Britannia in 122 AD, the Roman Emperor Hadrian Augustus witnessed the aftermath of war between his armies and the savage Picts. In a show of Roman might, he ordered a wall to be built that would separate the Pict tribes from the rest of England. Grand in its design, the wall stretched 80 Roman miles, from coast to coast. Hadrian's Wall stood in service to the Roman Empire for nearly 300 years before its eventual decline. Today, Hadrian's Wall is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and the remains of the forts, towers, and turrets can still be explored.&#10;&#10;In Hadrian's Wall, players take on the role of a Roman General placed in charge of the construction of a milecastle and bordering wall. Over six years (rounds), players will construct their fort and wall, man the defenses, and attract civilians by building services and providing entertainment &mdash; all while defending the honor of the Roman Empire from the warring Picts. The player who can accumulate the most renown, piety, valor and discipline, whilst avoiding disdain, will prove to the Emperor they are the model Roman citizen and be crowned Legatus Legionis!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;	\N	1	6	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/4XzRDw3VrgNpNfZlzZl66w__original/img/SfU1sNqUtpcvhcdzspDb5M9uSQQ=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic5608818.png	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/4XzRDw3VrgNpNfZlzZl66w__thumb/img/dGMBL60RMtAfcx741phN75mqlnA=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5608818.png
151	34635	Stone Age	The &quot;Stone Age&quot; times were hard indeed. In their roles as hunters, collectors, farmers, and tool makers, our ancestors worked with their legs and backs straining against wooden plows in the stony earth. Of course, progress did not stop with the wooden plow. People always searched for better tools and more productive plants to make their work more effective.&#10;&#10;In Stone Age, the players live in this time, just as our ancestors did. They collect wood, break stone and wash their gold from the river. They trade freely, expand their village and so achieve new levels of civilization. With a balance of luck and planning, the players compete for food in this pre-historic time.&#10;&#10;Players use up to ten tribe members each in three phases. In the first phase, players place their men in regions of the board that they think will benefit them, including the hunt, the trading center, or the quarry. In the second phase, the starting player activates each of their staffed areas in whatever sequence they choose, followed in turn by the other players. In the third phase, players must have enough food available to feed their populations, or they face losing resources or points.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/elmZegVZ6gp4_5izUgxGQQ__original/img/cR92Dm6yQ3Lgxt1yR81zUb0ooqQ=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1632539.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/elmZegVZ6gp4_5izUgxGQQ__thumb/img/MXq3DEKWIozO-PmB4S64BiE5fd0=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1632539.jpg

From Edinburgh to Constantinople and from Lisbon to Moscow, you'll visit great cities of turn-of-the-century Europe. Like the original Ticket to Ride, the game remains elegantly simple, can be learned in 5 minutes, and appeals to both families and experienced gamers. Ticket to Ride: Europe is a complete, new game and does not require the original version.&#10;&#10;More than just a new map, Ticket to Ride: Europe features brand new gameplay elements. Tunnels may require you to pay extra cards to build on them, Ferries require locomotive cards in order to claim them, and Stations allow you to sacrifice a few points in order to use an opponent's route to connect yours. The game also includes larger format cards and Train Station game pieces.&#10;&#10;The overall goal remains the same: collect and play train cards in order to place your pieces on the board, attempting to connect cities on your ticket cards. Points are earned both from placing trains and completing tickets but uncompleted tickets lose you points.

154	328871	Terraforming Mars: Ares Expedition	Terraforming Mars: Ares Expedition is an engine-building game in which players control interplanetary corporations with the goal of making Mars habitable (and profitable). You will do this by investing mega credits (MC) into project cards that will directly or indirectly contribute to the terraforming process. In order to win, you will want to accumulate a high terraform rating (TR) and as many victory points (VP) as you can. Players raise their TR by increasing global parameters: oceans, oxygen, and temperature. TR also determines each corporation's basic income, and, at the end of the game TR counts as VP. Additional VP and production capabilities are awarded for building project cards and other actions taken during the game.&#10;&#10;The game is played in rounds, and each round the players will choose one of five phases, which determines which activities will take place during that round. This means every round is different, but can consist of building new project cards, taking general and project-specific actions, producing income and resources (plants and heat), or researching to draw more project cards. Every player will take all the phases selected for the round, and will receive a special bonus during the phase that they selected. To speed up the game, within each phase, players can act simultaneously without waiting for each other!&#10;&#10;The game board has tracks for oxygen, temperature, and terraform rating, as well as a place for all of the ocean tiles that will be flipped over the course of the game. The game ends when there is enough oxygen to breath (14%), oceans enough to allow Earth-like weather (9), and the temperature is well above freezing (+8&deg;C). It will then be possible, if not comfortable, to live on the surface of Mars!&#10;&#10;The winner is the player with the most VP at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;	\N	1	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/eT_Atcy_vRJvuUMgYakNrQ__original/img/upZwrb6k8zZMNTwB8VfpI372yuo=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic6260098.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/eT_Atcy_vRJvuUMgYakNrQ__thumb/img/YxoNRQg9owsoi68POaMY0Ix31ZI=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6260098.jpg
155	77423	The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game	The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game is a cooperative adventure game in which the players attempt to complete a scenario, each with up to three heroes of their choice and a deck of allies, events and attachments to support them. Each round, players send their heroes and allies to quest or to fight with enemies that engage them. However, as the heroes and allies exhaust after questing, defending, or attacking, the players' options are typically insufficient to deal with everything at once. Therefore, players need to determine whether it is more urgent to quest and make progress in the scenario while the enemy forces gain power, or to take down enemies while making no progress, not knowing what will come next.&#10;&#10;The core set contains three scenarios, twelve famous heroes from the works of J.R.R. Tolkien (including Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, Denethor, and &Eacute;owyn), and four pre-constructed player decks. Players can either use one of these decks or construct their own deck to increase their chances of success and to explore new strategies. Additionally, The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game is a Living Card Game with over ten years of content, and its content is re-released regularly in the form of Campaign and Hero Expansions. Campaign Expansions contain new scenarios for players to embark upon, and Hero Expansions contain new heroes and new cards for players to use in their decks.&#10;&#10;Although this game is set in Tolkien's Middle-earth, most scenarios in the game do not represent scenes from the books, but rather take place in the seventeen years from Bilbo's 111th birthday until Frodo's departure from the Shire, allowing players to create their own stories and adventures in Middle-earth. Scenarios from the game's Saga Expansions do follow the events of The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit books, and the scenarios from each Saga Expansion can be played individually or together as a Campaign Mode, with lasting consequences from game to game arising from the players' actions and decisions.&#10;&#10;	\N	1	2	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ZmXi5BbtoWl58ZnKcUy1vw__original/img/nNHf1qRJCVQx_0p-1zM8QKxcywo=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic906495.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ZmXi5BbtoWl58ZnKcUy1vw__thumb/img/__NGanznvqHKTFhj28S8ZpfLbpc=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic906495.jpg
158	463	Magic: The Gathering	&#10;&#10;&#10;    &#10;        GAME SYSTEM&#10;&#10;    &#10;    &#10;         This entry is to allow for discussion/rating of the game system as a whole. It is not for a specific product or release. Versions will appear on the individual item pages.&#10;&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;From the official website:  In the Magic game, you play the role of a planeswalker&mdash;a powerful wizard who fights other planeswalkers for glory, knowledge, and conquest. Your deck of cards represents all the weapons in your arsenal. It contains the spells you know and the creatures you can summon to fight for you.&#10;&#10;This is the grandfather of the collectible card game (or CCG) genre.  Cards are categorized as common, uncommon, rare, and mythic rare.  Players collect cards and build decks out of their collection.&#10;&#10;Players build a deck of cards and duel against an opponent's deck.  Players are wizards attempting to reduce their opponent's life total to zero.  The first player to reduce his opponent's life to zero (or meet another set win condition) wins the game.&#10;&#10;An important part of the game is deck construction, which is done prior to the actual game by selecting what cards are included in a particular deck.  There are over 25,000 different cards from which to build your deck!&#10;&#10;Cards can be lands, which usually generate mana of various colors, or spells, which require a certain amount of mana to be used.  Some cards (creatures, artifacts, and enchantments) stay on the board and continue to affect the game, while others have a one-time effect.&#10;&#10;Players randomly draw spells to see what they get and can play each turn.  Although this limits your choices, there is a lot of strategy in how you play those spells.  A robust list of game mechanics, including intricate rules for reactive card play called &quot;the stack,&quot; provide for rich tactics and tough choices each turn.&#10;&#10;Though traditionally a two-player duel, there are several casual and tournament formats to Magic that allow more players to play.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	2	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/CxJmNl4wR4InjqyNrMdBTw__original/img/TKQgvl_i6zVYld8Gac8oU-c2ezE=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic163749.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/CxJmNl4wR4InjqyNrMdBTw__thumb/img/TtlQgYxLTPyYQWJvruMHfwKPReE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic163749.jpg
159	189932	Tyrants of the Underdark	Tyrants of the Underdark is a territory control game with a deck-building element.&#10;&#10;Each player leads a house of Drow in a section of the Underdark below the Sword Coast. The Drow house is represented by a deck of cards, with each card being a minion in that player's deck. Each minion belongs to one of five aspects of Drow society, and those aspects correspond to different strategies in the game, e.g., malice minions excel at assassinating opponents' troops, while ambition minions are best at recruiting additional minions and promoting minions to your &quot;inner circle&quot;, which is a special zone that increases their value at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;When you set up the game, you create an 80-card deck by shuffling two 40-card half-decks together, with the half-decks being Drow, Dragons, Demons, and Elementals.&#10;&#10;A central marketplace has new minions that can be recruited through influence, one of two resources in the game; purchased cards are placed in your discard pile, then shuffled together with other cards in your deck when needed. The other resource is power, which allows you to place troops on the game board, expand your forces across the map of the Underdark, manipulate happenings in the city, and assassinate enemy troops.&#10;&#10;Players gain points by controlling sites, recruiting valuable minions, promoting minions to your inner circle, and assassinating troops, and whoever ends the game with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/F58jczp5xk9CYFimrytXaw__original/img/m0S3T9_YWM7VvTW1c3pl4tBiu2c=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2801874.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/F58jczp5xk9CYFimrytXaw__thumb/img/X2ur4XNMdPRURbaziJ8nQmioNGE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2801874.jpg
160	296151	Viscounts of the West Kingdom	Viscounts of the West Kingdom is set at a time when the King&rsquo;s reign began to decline, circa 980 AD. Choosing peace over prosperity, our once strong King began offering our enemies gold and land to lay down their axes. But peace is a tenuous affair. As poverty spread, many people lost faith in his ability to lead and sought independence from the crown. Since finding favour in his courts, our future has also become uncertain. As viscounts, we must be wise and decisive. Loyalty is to be upheld, but gaining favour among the people must be our priority, should there be a sudden shift in power.&#10;&#10;The aim of Viscounts of the West Kingdom is to be the player with the most victory points (VP) at game's end. Points are gained by constructing buildings, writing manuscripts, working in the castle and acquiring deeds for new land. Players begin with a handful of townsfolk, but should quickly seek out more suitable talents to advance their endeavours. Each turn they will be travelling around the kingdom, looking to increase their influence among the various areas of society. The game ends once the Kingdom reaches poverty or prosperity - or potentially both!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;	\N	1	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/kMgSC_kRlJWt3KLj5y0BxQ__original/img/t9ccf6x3PQiL5Cqn4-mePKUNC-E=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic5230695.png	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/kMgSC_kRlJWt3KLj5y0BxQ__thumb/img/2uNYQn2vHuNGrx5-dxc1h7Mh7Do=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5230695.png
161	268864	Undaunted: Normandy	June, 1944: Through the D-Day landings, the Allies have seized a foothold on the beaches of Normandy. Now you must lead your troops forward as you push deeper into France and drive the German forces back. You will face intense resistance, machine gun fire, and mortar bombardment, but a great commander can turn the situation to their advantage!&#10;&#10;Undaunted: Normandy is a deck-building game that places you and your opponent in command of American or German forces, fighting through a series of missions critical to the outcome of World War II. Use your cards to seize the initiative, bolster your forces, or control your troops on the battlefield. Strong leadership can turn the tide of battle in your favor, but reckless decisions could prove catastrophic as every casualty you take removes a card from your deck. Take charge amidst the chaos of battle, hold fast in the face of opposition, and remain undaunted.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;	\N	2	2	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/iCd6hMGDzsQ_UXh00iKsJA__original/img/QhbQ2AMud-_H0fliiSIvc0dowOU=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4602347.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/iCd6hMGDzsQ_UXh00iKsJA__thumb/img/QbOlBm7DZGP2ZBnGZ-YaD-py-UQ=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4602347.jpg
213	154086	Gold West	In Gold West, players compete as prospectors building their mining empires while vying over the precious metals of the frontier. In a delicate balance of resource management and area control, players must plan their building strategies while carefully managing their supply tracks to refine the right resources at the most opportune times. Stay a step ahead of the competition and you could lead the West into the Golden Age.&#10;&#10;The goal of Gold West is to accumulate the most victory points through clever management of your growing mining empire. There are five resources in the game: the metals Copper, Silver, and Gold are used to acquire victory points in a variety of ways, while Timber and Stone are building materials used to build camps and settlements on the board to collect more resources and influence the landscape.&#10;&#10;Each hex contains either two or three resources. Gold generally earns players the most points, with silver and copper yielding slightly less. In addition, each terrain type scores points for the player with the most influence therein at the end of the game. Copper terrains are the most valuable, with Silver, Gold, and Forest Terrains earning slightly fewer points.&#10;&#10;When gaining new metals and materials, players place them in their &quot;supply track&quot;, a mancala-style track in which you will manage your resources. You get points the further back in the track you place them, as this creates a more refined product, but it will take longer to get these resources to the front of the supply track where they can be used. Shipping, investments, and Boomtown offices often reward players who fulfill them earlier, so it's a careful balance of risk and reward.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/I46l7g9vnVL4Isq8uBeTrw__original/img/36ICElu5gPfbNo1Ub2APDCrzg9o=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic7336167.png	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/I46l7g9vnVL4Isq8uBeTrw__thumb/img/NwOx5NdXYaPEcFOk8gXm8Wekmqg=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7336167.png
162	148949	Istanbul	There's hustle and bustle at Istanbul's grand bazaar as merchants and their assistants rush through the narrow alleys in their attempt to be more successful than their competitors. Everything must be well organized: wheelbarrows must be filled with goods at the warehouses, then swiftly transported by the assistants to various destinations. Your goal? Be the first merchant to collect a certain number of rubies.&#10;&#10;In Istanbul, you lead a group of one merchant and four assistants through 16 locations in the bazaar. At each such location, you can carry out a specific action. The challenge, though, is that to take an action, you must move your merchant and an assistant there, then leave the assistant behind (to handle all the details while you focus on larger matters). If you want to use that assistant again later, your merchant must return to that location to pick him up. Thus, you must plan ahead carefully to avoid being left with no assistants and thus unable to do anything...&#10;&#10;In more detail, on a turn you move your merchant and his retinue of assistants one or two steps through the bazaar, either leave an assistant at that location or collect an assistant left earlier, then perform the action. If you meet other merchants or certain individuals at the location, you might be able to take a small extra action. Possible actions include:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Paying to increase your wheelbarrow capacity, which starts the game with a capacity of only two for each good.&#10;    Filling your wheelbarrow with a specified good to its limit.&#10;    Acquiring a special ability, and the earlier you come, the easier they are to collect.&#10;    Buying rubies or trading goods for rubies.&#10;    Selling special combinations of goods to make the money you need to do everything else.&#10;&#10;&#10;When a merchant has collected five rubies in his wheelbarrow, players complete that round, then the game ends. If this player is the only one who's reached this goal, he wins immediately; otherwise ties are broken by money in hand.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	5	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/PHH9Mreen2sBcxV6ZsE3ew__original/img/pHIJibqf-DmlOQD3CfT_rAjGmc0=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1885326.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/PHH9Mreen2sBcxV6ZsE3ew__thumb/img/Vzpg3sdeAbCy0IxSAoh1aH9nvDE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1885326.jpg
163	265188	Glen More II: Chronicles	Glen More II: Chronicles is a sequel to Glen More, expanding the gameplay substantially compared to the original game.&#10;&#10;In Glen More II: Chronicles, each player represents the leader of a Scottish clan from the early medieval ages until the 19th century, a leader looking to expand their territory and wealth. The success of your clan depends on your ability to make the right decision at the right time, be it by creating a new pasture for your livestock, growing barley for whisky production, selling your goods on the various markets, or gaining control of special landmarks such as lochs and castles.&#10;&#10;The game lasts four rounds, represented by four stacks of tiles. After each round, a scoring phase takes place in which players compare their number of whisky casks, scotsmen in the home castle, landmark cards, and persons against the player with the fewest items in each category and receives victory points (VPs) based on the relative difference. After four rounds, additional VPs are awarded for gold coins and some landmarks while VP penalties are assessed based on territory size, comparing each player's territory to the smallest one in play.&#10;&#10;The core mechanism of Glen More II: Chronicles and Glen More functions the same way: The last player in line takes a tile from a time track, advancing as far as they wish on this track. After paying the cost, they place this tile in their territory, with this tile activating itself and all neighboring tiles, triggering the production of resources, movement points, VPs, etc. Then the player who is last in line takes their turn.&#10;&#10;Improvements over the original Glen More include bigger tiles, better materials, new artwork, the ability for each player to control the end of the game, and balancing adjustments to the tiles for a better suspense curve. The game is designed to consist of one-third known systems, one-third new mechanisms, and one-third improvements to Glen More.&#10;&#10;The &quot;Chronicles&quot; in the title &mdash; a set of eight expansions to the base game &mdash; are a major part of these new mechanisms. Each Chronicle adds a new gameplay element to the base game. The &quot;Highland Boat Race&quot; Chronicle, for example, tells the story of a boat race in which the winner needs to be the first to reach their home castle after navigating their boat along the river through all the other players' territories. The &quot;Hammer of the Scots&quot; Chronicle adds a neutral &quot;Englishman&quot; playing piece to the time track that players struggle to control to get an additional turn &mdash; if they can afford him, that is, as he is paid using the market mechanism. All Chronicles can be freely combined, although designer Matthias Cramer suggests that players use only one or two unless they want a &quot;monster game&quot;.&#10;&#10;Another major change to the game is the ability to invest in famous Scottish people of the time, who are represented through a new &quot;person&quot; tile type. Persons not only have their own scoring, they also trigger one-time or ongoing effects on the tactical clan board. This adds a new layer of decision making, especially since the ongoing effects allow players to focus on a personal strategy of winning through the use of the clan board.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/sMRuph3HFUcaSpJZihGZKw__original/img/ehoqoTirtFb5p9Wk2SwWV8nr6ZU=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5841874.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/sMRuph3HFUcaSpJZihGZKw__thumb/img/UHuDcnjAwCiXbNfjuY26-EEnG2M=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5841874.jpg

Each player starts as a lowly but hopeful captain of a small starship.&#10;&#10;Players fly their ships about the system, completing a variety of missions, exploring new sectors and battling other ships. Navigating hazardous environments, players choose to mine, salvage, or trade valuable cargo. Captains vie with each other for Titles, riches and, most importantly, Fame.&#10;&#10;The most adaptive, risk-taking and creative players will excel. One captain will rise above the others, surpassing mortality by becoming Legend!&#10;&#10;Customize: Each player begins the game by choosing and customizing a Tier 1 starship. Invest all your money in engines and be a rapid, yet fragile, explorer. Put all your credits into an uber missile and watch other players flee in terror. Get a small engine and save space and credits to invest in buying and selling cargo. Or create a well rounded ship, ready for anything. In Xia, the choice is always yours.&#10;&#10;Adapt: The goal of Xia is to become the most famous captain. Completing missions, besting ships in combat, purchasing higher tier ships, selling Cargo Cubes and claiming Titles are all ways that players can earn Fame Points. The best pilots will adapt to their surroundings, making snap judgments and changing plans on-the-fly. If you can think on your feet, you'll do well in Xia!&#10;&#10;Sandbox: The real fun of Xia is that each game will be different. There is no set direction of play - players may choose to be peaceful traders, fierce pirates, workers, miners, opportunists, etc. The game board is randomly laid out and explored each time you play. Players might choose not to explore at all, creating a tiny arena for swift and deadly combat, or explore all 19 sectors and have a large play-scape to exploit. It's up to you!&#10;&#10;Modding: Xia is very open to modding, and the community has already created loads of stuff.

Instead you flip cards from three piles to make three different action sets with both a house number and a corresponding action from which everyone chooses one. You use the number to fill in a house on your street in numerical order. Then you take the action to increase the point value of estates you build or score points at the end for building parks and pools. Players also have the option of taking actions to alter or duplicate their house numbers. And everyone is racing to be the first to complete public goals.

169	54043	Jaipur	You are one of the two most powerful traders in the city of Jaipur, the capital of Rajasthan, but that's not enough for you because only the merchant with two &quot;seals of excellence&quot; will have the privilege of being invited to the Maharaja's court. You are therefore going to have to do better than your direct competitor by buying, exchanging, and selling at better prices, all while keeping an eye on both your camel herds.&#10;&#10;Jaipur is a fast-paced card game, a blend of tactics, risk and luck. On your turn, you can either take or sell cards. If you take cards, you have to choose between taking all the camels, taking one card from the market, or swapping 2-5 cards between the market and your cards.&#10;&#10;If you sell cards, you get to sell only one type of good, and you receive as many chips for that good as the number of cards you sold. The chips' values decrease as the game progresses, so you'd better hurry! On the other hand, you receive increasingly high rewards for selling three, four, or five cards of the same good at a time, so you'd better wait!&#10;&#10;You can't sell camels, but they're paramount for trading and they're also worth a little something at the end of the round, enough sometimes to secure the win, so you have to use them smartly.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	2	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/_LTujSe_o16nvjDC-J0seA__original/img/zUnAdsgt4dCxvtoRDc_9DHbic0M=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5100947.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/_LTujSe_o16nvjDC-J0seA__thumb/img/82vhODfpxIT03BzW4NkisJ5Unzs=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5100947.jpg

172	209418	Dominion (Second Edition)	&quot;You are a monarch, like your parents before you, a ruler of a small pleasant kingdom of rivers and evergreens. Unlike your parents, however, you have hopes and dreams! You want a bigger and more pleasant kingdom, with more rivers and a wider variety of trees. You want a Dominion! In all directions lie fiefs, freeholds, and feodums. All are small bits of land, controlled by petty lords and verging on anarchy. You will bring civilization to these people, uniting them under your banner.&#10;&#10;&quot;But wait! It must be something in the air; several other monarchs have had the exact same idea. You must race to get as much of the unclaimed land as possible, fending them off along the way. To do this you will hire minions, construct buildings, spruce up your castle, and fill the coffers of your treasury. Your parents wouldn't be proud, but your grandparents, on your mother's side, would be delighted.'&quot;'&#10;&#10;In Dominion, each player starts with an identical, very small deck of cards. In the center of the table is a selection of other cards the players can &quot;buy&quot; as they can afford them. Through their selection of cards to buy and how they play their hands as they draw them, the players construct their deck on the fly, striving for the most efficient path to the precious victory points by game end.&#10;&#10;Dominion is not a collectible card game (CCG), but the play of the game is similar to the construction and play of a CCG deck. The game comes with 500 cards. You select 10 of the 26 Kingdom card types to include in any given play&mdash;leading to immense variety.&#10;&#10;Dominion (Second Edition) replaces six Kingdom card types from the first edition with six new types of Kingdom cards, while also replacing the blank cards in the game with a seventh new Kingdom card. These new cards are available on their own in the Dominion: Update Pack. The rulebook has been rewritten, three cards have mild functional changes (&quot;you may&quot; added to Moneylender, Mine, Throne Room), and other cards have been rephrased (while remaining functionally the same).&#10;&#10;Dominion: Update Pack contains the seven new kingdom cards introduced in the second edition of Dominion, thereby allowing owners of the first edition to obtain these new cards without needing to repurchase the entire game.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/4dmyKfqQm_uxA1-chh4JeQ__original/img/5UxDHPldIiCb0uovIwzngR-jx5M=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3187001.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/4dmyKfqQm_uxA1-chh4JeQ__thumb/img/Td5CxjO0ZTIbwHNhk2ETEy1qYyg=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3187001.jpg

173	9609	War of the Ring	In War of the Ring, one player takes control of the Free Peoples (FP), the other player controls Shadow Armies (SA).&#10;&#10;Initially, the Free People Nations are reluctant to take arms against Sauron, so they must be attacked by Sauron or persuaded by Gandalf or other Companions, before they start to fight properly: this is represented by the Political Track, which shows if a Nation is ready to fight in the War of the Ring or not.&#10;&#10;The game can be won by a military victory, if Sauron conquers a certain number of Free People cities and strongholds or vice-versa. But the true hope of the Free Peoples lies with the quest of the Ringbearer: while the armies clash across Middle Earth, the Fellowship of the Ring is trying to get secretly to Mount Doom to destroy the One Ring. Sauron is not aware of the real intention of his enemies but is looking across Middle Earth for the precious Ring, so that the Fellowship is going to face numerous dangers, represented by the rules of The Hunt for the Ring. But the Companions can spur the Free Peoples to the fight against Sauron, so the Free People player must balance the need to protect the Ringbearer from harm, against the attempt to raise a proper defense against the armies of the Shadow, so that they do not overrun Middle Earth before the Ringbearer completes his quest.&#10;&#10;Each game turn revolves around the roll of Action Dice: each die corresponds to an action that a player can do during a turn. Depending on the face rolled on each die, different actions are possible (moving armies, characters, recruiting troops, advancing a Political Track).&#10;&#10;Action dice can also be used to draw or play Event Cards. Event Cards are played to represent specific events from the story (or events that could possibly have happened) that cannot be portrayed through normal gameplay. Each Event Card can also create an unexpected turn in the game, allowing special actions or altering the course of a battle.&#10;&#10;Reimplemented by:&#10;&#10;    War of the Ring Collector's Edition&#10;    War of the Ring: Second Edition&#10;&#10;&#10;Upgrade to the 2nd edition (Card Pack) &#10;&#10;    War of the Ring (second edition): Upgrade Kit&#10;&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/JmdqlBJBynZMOciZzkVIkw__original/img/9LYzTUmOTO2enhJvqauMt6odC5Y=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic725882.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/JmdqlBJBynZMOciZzkVIkw__thumb/img/PgSR-5Hd8W6YBrLJLSvOBKH3Sls=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic725882.jpg
174	310100	Nemesis: Lockdown	Nemesis Lockdown is the first stand alone expansion to Nemesis. During the game, players will be taken to a totally new location - a secret base on Mars, represented by a multi level board.

175	277659	Final Girl	Playing on a famous horror movie trope, Final Girl is a solitaire-only game that puts the player in the shoes of a female protagonist who must kill the slasher if she wants to survive.&#10;&#10;The Core Box, when combined with one of our Feature Film Boxes, has everything you need to play the game. Each Feature Film Box features a unique Killer and and iconic Location, and the more Feature Films you have, the more killer/location combinations you can experience!&#10;&#10;In game terms, Final Girl shares similarities with Hostage Negotiator, but with some key differences that change it up, including a game board to track locations and character movement. You can choose from multiple characters when picking someone to play and multiple killers when picking someone to play against. Killers and locations each have their own specific terror cards that will be shuffled together to create a unique experience with various combinations of scenarios for you to play!&#10;&#10;NOTE: The 2022 Kickstarter for Final Girl: Season 2 included a 13 card Final Girl: First Printing Correction Pack of corrected cards for the first printing of Final Girl: Series 1.

177	188920	This War of Mine: The Board Game	This War Of Mine: The Board Game is the tabletop adaptation of the award-winning video game that pictures the drama of civilians trapped in a war-torn city.&#10;&#10;You will enter this experience as a group of civilians trapped in a besieged and conflict-ridden city, enduring many hardships that often test the essence of humanity.&#10;&#10;During day time you will take shelter in a ruined tenement house, which you will care about and manage by: removing rubble, searching through various rooms (often behind barricaded doors), you will build beds, improvised workshops, stoves, tools, water filters, small animal traps, you will cultivate an improvised vegetable garden, fix the tenements&rsquo; shelled facilities, reinforce the security of your shelter and should winter come, you&rsquo;ll try to keep it warm.&#10;&#10;Upon nightfall your main duties will consist of guarding your shelter and what little possessions you can accumulate against bandits and raiders. Those in your group fit for such a task will use the cover of the night to carefully explore dozens of the ever-changing locations scattered throughout the dangerous city in search of all the things that a person needs to survive (materials, food, meds, equipment, etc.). On your way you will meet tens of characters, each with a unique story (residents of the locations you visit, thieves, bandits, soldiers, war victims, refugees, neighbors, traders and members of local communities), each encounter is a potential, unique adventure. To guide you through all these events you will have the special SCRIPTS mechanism, responsible for implementing the deep and complex story and a coherent plot (each game will be unique and different than the previous).&#10;&#10;Your goal is to SURVIVE until the cessation of war hostilities. During your struggle as the survivors, you will experience dramas connected with making extremely difficult decisions and choices (you will have to face the consequences of your actions sooner or later in the playthrough). Survival itself will often prove not to be enough. The price each of you will decide to pay, might be too high in the final outcome. So the goal is really to survive in a way that will let you live on with the decisions you made. The EPILOGUES mechanism will kick in here.&#10;&#10;TWOM: The Board Game features a multiplayer experience for up to 6 players, as well as a solo variant. You will be able to personify one of the well-known characters from the electronic version of the game and face hundreds of new challenges and difficult choices.&#10;&#10;The boardgame significantly broadens the original game&rsquo;s universe and emphasises the depth of plot, yet its main focus will be on human interactions driven by survival instinct and group decision-making.&#10;&#10;The project aims to omit the usual boardgame threshold - TWOM: The Board Game is an INSTANT PLAY game, with no need for reading the manual before starting the adventure.&#10;&#10;Experience the simulation of a struggle for survival as a group of civilians facing a blind and merciless war.&#10;&#10;In war, not everyone is a soldier.&#10;&#10;	\N	1	6	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/gQOQW7p1RWHzY54Lrs-_pA__original/img/PSC8BO2njNcBJhxvi0IV5Jb5hgo=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3315915.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/gQOQW7p1RWHzY54Lrs-_pA__thumb/img/qmypl6agXd78n1_vAiO5LZcCXHc=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3315915.jpg
178	104162	Descent: Journeys in the Dark (Second Edition)	In Descent: Journeys in the Dark (Second Edition), one player takes on the role of the treacherous overlord, and up to four other players take on the roles of courageous heroes. During each game, the heroes embark on quests and venture into dangerous caves, ancient ruins, dark dungeons, and cursed forests to battle monsters, earn riches, and attempt to stop the overlord from carrying out his vile plot.&#10;&#10;With danger lurking in every shadow, combat is a necessity. For such times, Descent: Journeys in the Dark (Second Edition) uses a unique dice-based system. Players build their dice pools according to their character's abilities and weapons, and each die in the pool contributes to an attack in different ways. Surges, special symbols that appear on most dice, also let you trigger special effects to make the most of your attacks.

180	10630	Memoir '44	Memoir '44  is a historical boardgame where players face-off in stylized battles of some of the most famous historic battles of World War II including Omaha Beach, Pegasus Bridge, Operation Cobra and the Ardennes.&#10;&#10;Memoir '44 includes over 15 different battle scenarios and features a double-sided hex game board for both beach landings and countryside combat. Each scenario mimics the historical terrain, troop placements and objectives of each army. Commanders deploy troops through Command and Tactic cards, applying the unique skills of his units -- infantry, paratrooper, tank, artillery, and even resistance fighters -- to their greatest strength.&#10;&#10;&quot;By design, the game is not overly complex&quot;, says Memoir '44 designer, Richard Borg. &quot;The game mechanics, although simple, still require strategic card play, timely dice rolling and an aggressive yet flexible battle plan to achieve victory.&quot; In addition to the large, double-sided gameboard, Memoir '44 includes 144 amazingly detailed army miniatures - including historically accurate infantry, tanks and artillery; 36 Obstacle pieces, 60 illustrated Command cards, 44 Special Terrain tiles, and 8 Custom Wooden dice.&#10;&#10;Memoir '44 is designed for 2 players but easily accommodates team play. And with Memoir '44 Overlord scenarios, players can use multiple boards and up to 8 players to conduct large scale operations, experiencing the challenges of troop coordination and military chain of command on a large scale battlefield. Average game length is between 30 and 60 minutes, encouraging match play where players can command first one side and then the other.&#10;&#10;The Memoir '44 series consists of the base game and a number of expansions.&#10;&#10;This game is based upon Richard Borg's Command and Colors system.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	8	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/2AjxTtgBtZVst8wOAk1NAA__original/img/Ro6pGYz0WFmCOP5ytZ6Z40KhoZ4=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic6974498.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/2AjxTtgBtZVst8wOAk1NAA__thumb/img/ymrloLOMqIyQYu4JkYkB5T16W1I=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6974498.jpg

184	332772	Revive	Revive civilization, 5000 years after everything was destroyed. Lead your tribe and explore the frozen earth. Harness its resources. Recruit surface survivors to your cause. Build factories with powerful machines. And populate ancient sites to relearn your tribe's forgotten technologies.&#10;--&#10;Revive is a game for 1-4 players with asymmetric player powers, highly variable setup, and no fighting or direct conflict. Playing through the 5-part campaign unlocks additional contents, and once all contents have been unlocked, the game can be replayed indefinitely.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of the game, each player gets a set of citizen cards, a tribe board, as well as a huge dual-layer player board. The tribe board shows your unique tribe ability and the ancient technologies that you may relearn during the game. The dual-layer player board is where you place your custom machines and upgrade your card slots.&#10;&#10;A main goal of the game is to reach and populate the large ancient sites. These ancient locations are randomized, and as they are important sources of victory points, they will shape your strategy differently each game. The game ends when all artifacts have been taken, and the player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;On your turn you take two actions: &#10;&#10;     Play a card (its effect is determined by which card slot you use)&#10;     Explore (reveal an area tile and recruit a new citizen card)&#10;     Populate (populate an ancient location to learn a new technology)&#10;     Build factory (the adjacent terrains determine which machine tracks you advance)&#10;&#10;&#10;	\N	1	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/V0OZ9QR0pC9G5t5i9MoZTQ__original/img/NxxAoxVxMNkDGEkD3aoobPL14dI=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic6950224.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/V0OZ9QR0pC9G5t5i9MoZTQ__thumb/img/NPtXuKlsnfPORSn6kpTcf-ZdEF0=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6950224.jpg
191	25021	Sekigahara: The Unification of Japan	The battle of Sekigahara, fought in 1600 at a crossroads in Japan, unified that nation under the Tokugawa family for more than 250 years.&#10;&#10;Sekigahara allows you to re-contest that war as Ishida Mitsunari, defender of a child heir, or Tokugawa Ieyasu, Japan's most powerful daimyo (feudal lord).&#10;&#10;The campaign lasted only 7 weeks, during which each side improvised an army and a strategy with what forces their allies could provide. Each leader harbored deep doubts as to the loyalty of his units - for good reason. Several daimyo refused to fight; some even turned sides in the midst of battle.&#10;&#10;To conquer Japan you must do more than field an army - you must be sure it will follow you into combat. Cultivate the loyalty of your allies and deploy them only when you are confident of their allegiance. Win a battle by gaining a defection from the ranks of your opponent.&#10;&#10;Sekigahara is replete with unusual mechanics:&#10;&#10;        No dice are used&#10;        Cards represent loyalty and motivation. Without a matching card, an army will not enter battle.&#10;        Allegiance is represented by hand size, which fluctuates each turn.&#10;        Battles are a series of deployments, from hidden unit stacks, based on hidden loyalty factors. Loyalty Challenge cards create potential defection events.&#10;&#10;&#10;Sekigahara is a 3-hour block game based on the Japanese campaign waged in 1600. The 7-week war, fought along Japan's two major highways and in scattered sieges and backcountry skirmishes, elevated Tokugawa Ieyasu to Shogun and unified Japan for 265 years.&#10;&#10;Sekigahara is designed to offer an historically authentic experience within an intuitive game mechanic that can be played in one sitting. Great effort has been taken to preserve a clean game mechanism. (Despite a healthy amount of historical detail, the ruleset is a brief 6 pages.) Chance takes the form of uncertainty and not luck.&#10;&#10;No dice are used; combat is decided with cards. Blocks = armies and cards = motivation. The combination of army and motivation produces impact on the battlefield. Armies without matching cards don't fight. Battles resolve quickly, but with suspense, tactical participation, and a wide range of possible outcomes.&#10;&#10;Legitimacy is represented by hand size, which fluctuates each week according to the number of castles a player holds. Certain events deplete legitimacy, like force marches and lost battles. Recruitment, meanwhile, is a function of a daimyo's control over key production areas. Objectives (enemy units, castles, resources) exist all over the map.&#10;&#10;The initial setup is variable, so the situation is always fresh. Concealed information (blocks and cards) lends additional uncertainty. In this way the game feels like the actual campaign.&#10;&#10;Blocks are large and stackable. Every unit on the board is visible at once, and the strategic situation is comprehensible at a glance. Components use authentic clan designations and colors, and have a Japanese feel.&#10;&#10;True to history, the objectives (castles and economic centers) and forces (armies of allied daimyo) are dispersed. Support for one front means neglect for another. The player is pulled between competing priorities. Each side wonders where his opponent wants to fight, and where he is unready. There is a great deal of bluff in the game.&#10;&#10;Each player must rally the several daimyo of his coalition, managing the morale and motivation of each clan. The forces are dispersed, and while there are reasons to unify them, the objectives are also dispersed, and the timeframe compact, so skirmishing will occur all over the island.&#10;&#10;TIME SCALE     1 week per 2-player turns&#10;MAP SCALE     Point to point&#10;UNIT SCALE     One block = 5000 soldiers&#10;NUMBER OF PLAYERS     2&#10;&#10;COMPONENTS&#10;    Mounted Map&#10;    119 wooden pieces&#10;    1 and 1/2 sticker sheets&#10;    110 cards&#10;    Rulebook&#10;    Two player aid cards&#10;&#10;DESIGNER: Matthew Calkins&#10;MAP, CARD, &amp; BLOCK ART: Mark Mahaffey&#10;&#10;(source: GMT website)&#10;&#10;	\N	2	2	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/eMJAona-uXwh6t2AcugGEg__original/img/4LuFgxwxB8OcjoGBWg6_IxFkZ0s=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1063508.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/eMJAona-uXwh6t2AcugGEg__thumb/img/6qn1NgnJ9inZNfLlrBdWK3FritU=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1063508.jpg
186	17133	Railways of the World	Railways of the World (2009) is the new edition of the base game for Eagle Games' popular Railways of the World series, first published as Railroad Tycoon in 2005.  It reimplements the original game with several improvements.&#10;&#10;Revisit the early days of the Age of Steam as you begin with a locomotive (the venerable John Bull, the first locomotive to run in North America) and a vision (your Tycoon &quot;mission&quot; card). From there, build your budding railroad network into a vast empire. Connect New York to Chicago, earn the most money, develop bigger and faster locomotives and maybe even span North America and build the Transcontinental Railway!&#10;&#10;Multiple expansions featuring different maps are available.  Railways of the World is the new base game for the system and includes the engine placards, railroad tiles, train tokens, money, bonds, and other items that are needed in almost all the Railways of the World series. A gameboard depicting the eastern half of the United States is included in the base game, as well as a mounted map of Mexico.&#10;&#10;This game is preceded by the designer's other Winsome train games: Age of Steam, Australian Railways, Volldampf, New England Railways, Veld Spoorweg, Lancashire Railways, and Ferrocarriles Pampas.  Railroad Tycoon was the result of a collaboration with Glenn Drover, in which the mechanics and game-play of Martin Wallace's Age of Steam were simplified and streamlined and attractive over-produced components were added, in order to make Railroad Tycoon more appealing to less hardcore gamers and more accessible to a wider audience.&#10;&#10;A revised reprint was published at the end of 2010 which made some component improvements, such as the addition of Railroad Operation cards for the Mexico map.&#10;&#10;Complete series overview - The Railways of the World Series: Introducing the family members of the ideal medium-weight train game&#10;&#10;Note: The RailRoad Tycoon board itself is gigantic (about 36x45 inches, 91x114 cm) and requires a huge table or playing on the floor.&#10;&#10;Similar to:&#10;&#10;     Steam&#10;&#10;&#10;	\N	2	6	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Sz0wLg3TgycpzSvSMdzRJA__original/img/vi7OckGr7HWbTGOkEyxgcCUIfiU=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3869603.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Sz0wLg3TgycpzSvSMdzRJA__thumb/img/lfoHFV0OafSO8boxKEX8V3Tq5TM=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3869603.jpg
187	155426	Castles of Mad King Ludwig	In the tile-laying game Castles of Mad King Ludwig, players are tasked with building an amazing, extravagant castle for King Ludwig II of Bavaria...one room at a time. You see, the King loves castles, having built Neuschwanstein (the castle that inspired the Disney theme park castles) and others, but now he's commissioned you to build the biggest, best castle ever &mdash; subject, of course, to his ever-changing whims. Each player acts as a building contractor who is adding rooms to the castle he's building while also selling his services to other players.&#10;&#10;In the game, each player starts with a simple foyer. One player takes on the role of the Master Builder, and that player sets prices for a set of rooms that can be purchased by the other players, with him getting to pick from the leftovers after the other players have paid him for their rooms. When a room is added to a castle, the player who built it gains castle points based on the size and type of room constructed, as well as bonus points based on the location of the room. When a room is completed, with all entranceways leading to other rooms in the castle, the player receives one of seven special rewards.&#10;&#10;After each purchasing round, a new player becomes the Master Builder who sets prices for a new set of rooms. After several rounds, the game ends, then additional points are awarded for achieving bonus goals, having the most popular rooms, and being the most responsive to the King's demands, which change each game. Whoever ends up with the most castle points wins.&#10;&#10;	\N	1	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/jVAMlNeDMVZakxJPy-lDrQ__original/img/J4J6wVMItmWj4Yxt8JmuO1g76PE=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic7229993.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/jVAMlNeDMVZakxJPy-lDrQ__thumb/img/PfOJx2RMkYg-Uk7mWBMF0HvTxqo=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7229993.jpg
188	128882	The Resistance: Avalon	The Resistance: Avalon pits the forces of Good and Evil in a battle to control the future of civilization. Arthur represents the future of Britain, a promise of prosperity and honor, yet hidden among his brave warriors are Mordred's unscrupulous minions. These forces of evil are few in number but have knowledge of each other and remain hidden from all but one of Arthur's servants. Merlin alone knows the agents of evil, but he must speak of this only in riddles. If his true identity is discovered, all will be lost.&#10;&#10;The Resistance: Avalon is a standalone game, and while The Resistance is not required to play, the games are compatible and can be combined.&#10;&#10;	\N	5	10	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/LPa6rsGcv8S0-OeNjCOAEQ__original/img/AF8HHaIad1re-eg3kd9mlm2j_ss=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1398895.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/LPa6rsGcv8S0-OeNjCOAEQ__thumb/img/RKui79VjUbQAzTWaPu44ytupzDs=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1398895.jpg
189	199561	Sagrada	Draft dice and use the tools-of-the-trade in Sagrada to carefully construct your stained glass window masterpiece.&#10;&#10;In more detail, each player builds a stained glass window by building up a grid of dice on their player board. Each board has some restrictions on which color or shade (value) of die can be placed there. Dice of the same shade or color may never be placed next to each other. Dice are drafted in player order, with the start player rotating each round, snaking back around after the last player drafts two dice. Scoring is variable per game based on achieving various patterns and varieties of placement...as well as bonus points for dark shades of a particular hidden goal color.&#10;&#10;Special tools can be used to help you break the rules by spending skill tokens; once a tool is used, it then requires more skill tokens for the other players to use them.&#10;&#10;The highest scoring window artisan wins!&#10;&#10;	\N	1	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/PZt3EAAGV3dFIVuwMR0AEw__original/img/5ug9EeKlH_ucJEUXaFpTZbBJ1GY=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3525224.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/PZt3EAAGV3dFIVuwMR0AEw__thumb/img/1m4aryOW1MOpq-8jGkF6gDTJmCY=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3525224.jpg
190	321608	Hegemony: Lead Your Class to Victory	Extended edition includes Crisis &amp; Control expansion.&#10;&#10;&#10;The Nation is in disarray and a war is waging between the classes. The working class faces a dismantled welfare system, the capitalists are losing their hard-earned profits, the middle class is gradually fading and the state is sinking into a deep deficit. Amidst all this chaos, the only person who can provide guidance is... you. Will you take the side of the working class and fight for social reforms? Or will you stand with the corporations and the free market? Will you help the government try to keep it all together, or will you try to enforce your agenda no matter the cost to the country?&#10;&#10;Hegemony is an asymmetric politico-economic card-driven board game for 2-4 players that puts you in the role of one of the socio-economic groups in a fictional state: The Working Class, the Middle Class, the Capitalist Class and the State itself.&#10;&#10;The Working class controls the workers. The Capitalist class controls the companies. The Middle class combines elements from both the Working class and the Capitalist. It has workers who can work in the Capitalist's companies but it can also build companies of its own, yet smaller. Finally the State is trying to keep everyone happy, providing benefits and subsidies when needed but trying also to maintain a steady income through taxes to avoid going into debt.&#10;&#10;While players have their own separate goals, they are all limited by a series of policies that affect most of their actions, like Taxation, Labor Market, Foreign Trade etc. Voting on those policies and using their influence to change them is also very important. Through careful planning, strategic actions and political maneuvering, you will do your best to increase the power of your class and carry out your agenda. Will you be the one to lead your class to victory?&#10;&#10;Hegemony is heavily based on actual academic principles such as Social-Democracy, Neoliberalism, Nationalism and Globalism, and allows players to see their real world applications through engaging gameplay. There are many ways to achieve hegemony- which one will you take?&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/DCLgJlrvB-EqL6A3WgQLMQ__original/img/vGpYcxjDBCOVcI0BcWOevspTQMQ=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5715770.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/DCLgJlrvB-EqL6A3WgQLMQ__thumb/img/9yp6ANJx6cqdQqQ6hkNr3zA88vw=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5715770.jpg
192	283355	Dune	Imagine you can control the forces of a noble family, guild, or religious order on a barren planet which is the only source for the most valuable substance in the known universe.&#10;&#10;Imagine you can rewrite the script for one of the most famous science fiction books of all time. Welcome to the acclaimed 40-year-old board game which allows you to recreate the incredible world of Frank Herbert&rsquo;s DUNE.&#10;&#10;In DUNE you will become the leader of one of six great factions. Each wishes to control the most valuable resource in the universe - melange, the mysterious spice only found at great cost on the planet DUNE. As Duke Leto Atreides says &ldquo;All fades before melange. A handful of spice will buy a home on Tupile. It cannot be manufactured, it must be mined on Arrakis. It is unique and it has true geriatric properties.&rdquo; And without melange space travel would be impossible. Only by ingesting the addictive drug can the Guild Steersman continue to experience visions of the future, enabling them to plot a safe path through hyperspace.&#10;&#10;Who will control DUNE? Become one of the characters and their forces from the book and . . . You decide!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;	\N	2	6	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/2fgPg6Be--w97zoycObUgg__original/img/7PyNxWs85_OKGOm_jYVFvPwAViE=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4815198.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/2fgPg6Be--w97zoycObUgg__thumb/img/OrjzwJVfE8Qnk8e5efbae5EaSeY=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4815198.jpg
193	227224	The Red Cathedral	Autumn is not the best time to climb up on a scaffold in Moscow, but it is still far better than doing so in the winter. Tsar Ivan wants to see results and our team will prove to him that we are the best builders in the city. We are sure to finish off those decorative arches with the brightest shining stones and ensure our place on the list of the government&rsquo;s trusted workers.&#10;&#10;Sheila Santos and Israel Cendrero make up the game designing duo known as Llama Dice. To date they have put out various titles with different Spanish publishers (1987 Channel Tunnel, Mondrian, Smoothies), and The Red Cathedral is the first game they have published with Devir. Pedro Soto (Holmes, Sherlock &amp; Mycroft, Papua) and Chema Rom&aacute;n (El mundo de &Aacute;guila Roja) took care of the graphic elements of the game with a grand homage to Ivan Bilibin, an iconic Russian artist from the turn of the twentieth century. Despite being from a far later period, his mark is very recognizable in the game.&#10;&#10;The Red Cathedral is a strategic, &ldquo;Euro&rdquo; board game in which the players take the roles of construction teams. Their job is to work together to put up St. Basil's cathedral in Moscow, as ordered by Ivan the Terrible. However, only one of them will be able to gain the favor of the Tsar.&#10;&#10;During the game, the players can carry out one of these three actions: assign a section of the cathedral, send resources to that section to build it, or go to the game board to achieve more resources. Each of these actions has its own mechanism and requires that the players pay close attention to what the other players are doing.&#10;&#10;When the sections of the cathedral are assigned the players take possession of the spaces in each of the columns that make up their section. The more sections built and the completion of each with its own tower, the more points the player will be given at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;The players can send resources to the cathedral sections that they have claimed. When they complete each of those sections they will obtain rewards in money and prestige points. They will also be able to install decorations on the completed sections to achieve even more recognition from the Tsar. This part of the game also works as a clock, since once any player completes the construction of their sixth section it brings about the end of the game.&#10;&#10;The game board shows us the iconic rondel of The Red Cathedral. It is where the players obtain all the resource types needed to complete their work on the cathedral, as well as to get favors from the guilds and professionals to make the most of their trip to the market. In the central rondel the players choose the die they wish to use and move forward as many spaces as is shown on the top side of said die, in order to obtain the resources indicated in the space destined by the die.&#10;&#10;The Red Cathedral is a very accessible game with regard to its rules because it is very easy to understand the various levels of the game, but it remains very interesting with regard to strategy. It is sure to please those who are more interested in the challenge offered by trying to strategically optimize their position in each game rather than the complexity of the rules.&#10;&#10;	\N	1	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/-PuiCnbxlBzMSjnUegp9AQ__original/img/hH1AwTR4fdtYY_cO8IYp1-I8dhE=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5556025.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/-PuiCnbxlBzMSjnUegp9AQ__thumb/img/CKamYUPlBDXav4A1AEqMRy976fY=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5556025.jpg
194	70149	Ora et Labora	In Ora et Labora (Latin for 'Pray and work'), each player is head of a monastery in the Medieval era who acquires land and constructs buildings &ndash; little enterprises that will gain resources and profit. The goal is to build a working infrastructure and manufacture prestigious items &ndash; such as books, ceramics, ornaments, and relics &ndash; to gain the most victory points at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;Ora et Labora, Uwe Rosenberg's fifth &quot;big&quot; game, has game play mechanisms similar to his Le Havre, such as two-sided resource tiles that can be upgraded from a basic item to something more useful. Instead of adding resources to the board turn by turn as in Agricola and Le Havre, Ora et Labora uses a numbered rondel to show how many of each resource is available at any time. At the beginning of each round, players turn the rondel by one segment, adjusting the counts of all resources at the same time.&#10;&#10;Each player has a personal game board. New buildings enter the game from time to time, and players can construct them on their game boards with the building materials they gather, with some terrain restrictions on what can be built where. Some spaces start with trees or moors on them, as in Agricola: Farmers of the Moor, so they hinder development until a player clears the land, but they provide resources when they are removed. Clever building on your personal game board will impact your final score, and players can buy additional terrain during the game, if needed.&#10;&#10;Players also have three workers who can enter buildings to take the action associated with that location. Workers must stay in place until you've placed all three. You can enter your own buildings with these workers, but to enter and use another player's buildings, you must pay that player an entry fee so that he'll move one of his workers into that building to do the work for you.&#10;&#10;Ora et Labora features two variants: France and Ireland.&#10;&#10;	\N	1	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/MLvyN4VJ3QNXBKxli8XLiA__original/img/eDqWAa7vUdsYE6_LXVNzIdClbhw=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5089618.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/MLvyN4VJ3QNXBKxli8XLiA__thumb/img/mvTvon7ry-QKtYenVgg0LYUtdRc=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5089618.jpg
195	103343	A Game of Thrones: The Board Game (Second Edition)	Game description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;King Robert Baratheon is dead, and the lands of Westeros brace for battle.&#10;&#10;In the second edition of A Game of Thrones: The Board Game, three to six players take on the roles of the great Houses of the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros, as they vie for control of the Iron Throne through the use of diplomacy and warfare. Based on the best-selling A Song of Ice and Fire series of fantasy novels by George R.R. Martin, A Game of Thrones is an epic board game in which it will take more than military might to win. Will you take power through force, use honeyed words to coerce your way onto the throne, or rally the townsfolk to your side? Through strategic planning, masterful diplomacy, and clever card play, spread your influence over Westeros!&#10;&#10;To begin the game, each player receives an army of Footman, Knight, Siege Engine, and Ship units, as well as a set of Order tokens and other necessary components. Each player also receives a deck of unique House Cards, which are used as leaders in battles against rival Houses.&#10;&#10;Each round in the game is made up of three phases: the Westeros Phase, the Planning Phase, and the Action Phase. The Westeros Phase represents special events and day-to-day activities in Westeros. There are three different Westeros Decks, and each denotes a different global action, potentially affecting all players.&#10;&#10;The Planning Phase is perhaps the most important. Here you secretly assign orders to all of your units by placing one order token face down on each area you control that contains at least one unit (Knight, Footman, Ship, or Siege Engine). This portion of the game emphasizes diplomacy and deduction. Can you trust the alliance that you made? Will you betray your ally and march upon him? Players may make promises to each other (for aid or peace, for example), but these promises are never binding. The result is tense and compelling negotiations, often ending in backstabbing worthy of Westeros!&#10;&#10;During the Action Phase, the orders are resolved and battle is entered! When armies meet in combat, they secretly choose one of their House cards to add strength to the battle. Finally, the Houses can consolidate their power in the areas they control and use that power in future turns to influence their position in the court of the Iron Throne and to stand against the wildling Hordes.&#10;&#10;In addition to featuring updated graphics and a clarified ruleset, this second edition of A Game of Thrones includes elements from the A Clash of Kings and A Storm of Swords expansions, including ports, garrisons, Wildling cards, and Siege engines, while introducing welcome new innovations like player screens and Tides of Battle cards.&#10;&#10;Tides of Battle cards are an optional mechanism that brings an element of unpredictability to combat, representing erratic shifts in the momentum of war due to factors such as weather, morale, and tactical opportunity. During each combat, both players draw one Tides of Battle card from a communal deck, and its value modifies the strength of his chosen House card. What's more, such a card may also contain icons that can affect the outcome of the battle...all of which delivers a new level of intensity to your military engagements.&#10;&#10;Expanded by:&#10;&#10;     A Game of Thrones: The Board Game (Second Edition) &#226;&#128;&#147; A Dance with Dragons (2012)&#10;     A Game of Thrones: The Board Game (Second Edition) &#226;&#128;&#147; A Feast for Crows (2013)&#10;     A Game of Thrones: The Board Game (Second Edition) &#226;&#128;&#147; Mother of Dragons (2018)&#10;&#10;&#10;Reimplements:&#10;&#10;     A Game of Thrones (2003)&#10;     A Game of Thrones: A Clash of Kings Expansion (2004)&#10;     A Game of Thrones: A Storm of Swords Expansion (2006)&#10;&#10;&#10;	\N	3	6	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/M_7UvwZvuxBVjxdadsa5AA__original/img/3tv6H7jX5T9rqwuI84YZKZDBGcw=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1077906.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/M_7UvwZvuxBVjxdadsa5AA__thumb/img/ZQ9guRvmMgYfseBC3_xNscMOKKo=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1077906.jpg
196	31627	Ticket to Ride: Nordic Countries	Ticket to Ride: Nordic Countries takes you on a Nordic adventure through Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden as you travel to the great northern cities of Copenhagen, Oslo, Helsinki, and Stockholm. This version was initially available only in the Nordic Countries of Denmark, Norway, Sweden, and Finland; a worldwide limited-edition release occurred in August 2008 and it has since been kept in print again by Days of Wonder.&#10;&#10;The goal in &quot;Nordic&quot; remains the same as base Ticket to Ride: collect and play cards to place your trains on the board, attempting to connect the different cities on your ticket cards. The map incorporates tunnels from Europe and also has routes containing ferries. Ferries will require a certain number of Locomotives to be played, as well as other cards, in order to be claimed. Locomotives are handled a bit differently as well. On your turn you may take 2 Locomotives if you want, but you can only use them on ferries, tunnels, or the special 9 length route.&#10;&#10;Unlike the USA or Europe maps, Nordic is designed for 2-3 players only and has a heavier focus on blocking your opponent and more aggressive play.&#10;&#10;Although not an official expansion for this set, Ticket to Ride Map Collection 5: United Kingdom & Pennsylvania can be used as an expansion for Nordic Countries, although limited to the three players included in this set.  Nordic Countries includes three sets of 40 trains, with 5 spare for each colour; the UK map in Ticket to Ride Map Collection 5: United Kingdom & Pennsylvania requires 35 trains and the Pennsylvania map requires 45 trains.&#10;&#10;Part of the Ticket to Ride series.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	3	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/bCdjNIu-O_SzVCfMLZY_KQ__original/img/GhYRV-yJmYEiTaZsZcnEA04YucA=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic7634498.png	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/bCdjNIu-O_SzVCfMLZY_KQ__thumb/img/YYhnkc5JxY3qmg-_2w_Tb2rMeXE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7634498.png

203	207830	5-Minute Dungeon	5-&shy;Minute Dungeon is a chaotic, co-&shy;operative, real-&shy;time card game in which players have only five minutes to escape the randomized dungeon. Communication and teamwork are critical to survival because there's no time to form a carefully considered plan &mdash; and no predicting what dangers lie ahead.&#10;&#10;In more detail, players assume the role of one of ten heroes, each with special cards and abilities. Once the five-minute timer starts, the race is on to defeat all the monsters inside the dungeon. In order to defeat a monster, players must match symbols from their hand with ones on the monster's card. At the end of each dungeon is a powerful dungeon boss &mdash; and after the first boss is defeated, the campaign continues to the second boss. Each boss, and each randomized dungeon, gets harder until players reach the fifth and final boss.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	5	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/usqxLNW5a2nobraAaWZ2tA__original/img/3myzvar1Do9QFxLEvMf7-4OkR5I=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3691901.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/usqxLNW5a2nobraAaWZ2tA__thumb/img/g1Y2h15_Qyu6W42nqZEwqABdSoY=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3691901.jpg
198	271896	Star Wars: Outer Rim	Take to the stars and become a living legend in Star Wars: Outer Rim, a game of bounty hunters, mercenaries, and smugglers for 1-4 players!&#10;&#10;In Outer Rim, you take on the role of an underworld denizen, setting out to make your mark on the galaxy. You'll travel the outer rim in your personal ship, hire legendary Star Wars characters to join your crew, and try to become the most famous (or infamous) outlaw in the galaxy!&#10;&#10;But it won't be easy since the warring factions of the galaxy roam the outer rim, hunting down the scum that have proven to be a thorn in their side, and other scoundrels looking to make their mark see you as the perfect target to bring down to bolster their own reputation. Do you have what it takes to survive in the outer rim and become a living legend?&#10;&#10;In more detail, a game of Outer Rim takes place over a series of turns that sees players taking dangerous jobs, tracking down bounties, upgrading their ship, and more, all in service of gaining more and more fame. Regardless of the path you take to get there, your goal is to gain ten fame, which can come from a variety of sources, such as completing your character's personal goal, collecting on bounties and jobs, delivering illegal cargo, taking down patrols from the various factions struggling over the galaxy, and enjoying the finer things in life by purchasing luxury items with your hard-earned credits.&#10;&#10;While the path to victory may be different for scoundrels finding their way in the Outer Rim, everyone starts from the bottom with a simple starship. Your player board not only tracks your fame progress, but also contains slots for your ship, your character card, gear, reputation, modifications, jobs, and bounties.&#10;&#10;	\N	1	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/RjwAj6hw5aEMGvosEA12gw__original/img/jQUkqrDd0lOX6IRGq5Cbj1junL4=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5879810.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/RjwAj6hw5aEMGvosEA12gw__thumb/img/Ri6aOjHVFhgu_xK_xuBoCOCck-A=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5879810.jpg
199	150376	Dead of Winter: A Crossroads Game	&quot;Crossroads&quot; is a game series from Plaid Hat Games that tests a group of survivors' ability to work together and stay alive while facing crises and challenges from both outside and inside. Dead of Winter: A Crossroads Game, the first title in this series, puts 2-5 players in a small, weakened colony of survivors in a world in which most of humanity is either dead or diseased, flesh-craving monsters. Each player leads a faction of survivors, with dozens of different characters in the game.&#10;&#10;Dead of Winter is a meta-cooperative psychological survival game. This means players are working together toward one common victory condition, but for each individual player to achieve victory, they must also complete their personal secret objective, which could relate to a psychological tick that's fairly harmless to most others in the colony, a dangerous obsession that could put the main objective at risk, a desire for sabotage of the main mission, or (worst of all) vengeance against the colony! Games could end with all players winning, some winning and some losing, or all players losing. Work toward the group's goal, but don't get walked all over by a loudmouth who's looking out only for their own interests!&#10;&#10;Dead of Winter is an experience that can be accomplished only through the medium of tabletop games, a story-centric game about surviving through a harsh winter in an apocalyptic world. The survivors are all dealing with their own psychological imperatives, but must still find a way to work together to fight off outside threats, resolve crises, find food and supplies, and keep the colony's morale up.&#10;&#10;Dead of Winter has players making frequent, difficult, heavily-thematic, wildly-varying decisions that often have them deciding between what's best for the colony and what's best for themselves. The rulebook also includes a fully co-operative variant in which all players work toward the group objective with no personal goals.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	5	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/g4mV4BH-ZrhMUVgil-yV1A__original/img/NjrnSg1aeia8I4eETDU3I1Br7a8=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3016500.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/g4mV4BH-ZrhMUVgil-yV1A__thumb/img/foFGN8KwmN8BaYNpolq0HcMba4M=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3016500.jpg
200	123260	Suburbia	Plan, build, and develop a small town into a major metropolis. Use hex-shaped building tiles to add residential, commercial, civic, and industrial areas, as well as special points of interest that provide benefits and take advantage of the resources of nearby towns. Your goal is to have your borough thrive and end up with a greater population than any of your opponents.&#10;&#10;Suburbia is a tile-laying game in which each player tries to build up an economic engine and infrastructure that will be initially self-sufficient, and eventually become both profitable and encourage population growth. As your town grows, you'll modify both your income and your reputation. As your income increases, you'll have more cash on hand to purchase better and more valuable buildings, such as an international airport or a high-rise office building. As your reputation increases, you'll gain more and more population &mdash; and the player with the largest population at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;During each game, players compete for several unique goals that offer an additional population boost &mdash; and the buildings available in each game vary, so you'll never play the same game twice!&#10;&#10;The second edition of Suburbia features updated artwork, larger tiles than in the original game, a dual-sided scoreboard, GameTrayz storage organizers, and more!&#10;&#10;	\N	1	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/1YcHesB7LRvCF8i9vgH7qw__original/img/BVcGhHh0nedwcBBzu_ku-yh8LWY=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic6009608.png	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/1YcHesB7LRvCF8i9vgH7qw__thumb/img/LmYQpfDR6ds-9jGknAgbqjwuVs8=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6009608.png
201	14105	Commands & Colors: Ancients	From the designer (about his Commands and Colors system, C&amp;C: Ancients, and Memoir' 44):&#10;&#10;&quot;Commands &amp; Colors: Ancients&quot; depicts warfare from the Dawn of Military History (3000 BC) to the opening of the Dark Ages (400 AD). Quite an ambitious undertaking for one game, yet Commands &amp; Colors by design is a unique historical wargame system which allows players to effectively portray stylized battles from this time in history. The 15 battles, showcased in the scenario booklet, although stylized, focus on important terrain features and the historical deployment of forces in scale with the game system. The battles include Bagradas, Cannae, and Zama.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;The scale of the game fluctuates from battle to battle. For some scenarios, an infantry unit may represent a legion of fighters, while in other scenarios a unit may represent just a few brave warriors. But the tactics you need to execute conform remarkably well to the advantages and limitations inherent to the various units, their weapons, terrain and time.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Unlike its older brother, Battle Cry by Avalon Hill, Commands &amp; Colors: Ancients is moderately more complex and contains additional historical details without the battlefield clutter. Most scenarios will still play to a conclusion in less than an hour.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;The command card system, drives movement, creates a true fog of war and presents both challenges and opportunities. There are four types of command cards: Leadership cards, Section cards, Troop cards and Tactic cards.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;The battle dice system resolves all combat efficiently and quickly. Each battle die has one Light, one Medium, one Heavy, one Leader, one Flag and one Swords symbol.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;The game mechanics, although simple, will still require strategic card play, historical tactics, timely dice rolling, and an aggressive yet flexible battle plan, to achieve victory.&quot;&#10;&#10;	\N	2	2	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/qcASDsV-0eNBVipfPhxs7A__original/img/tyaZlnMJNbjwjRVcrbXpJBjrLRw=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic132447.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/qcASDsV-0eNBVipfPhxs7A__thumb/img/Ti0K9F5Hsh6mE4OiYKuTASpC844=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic132447.jpg
202	338760	Imperial Steam	The Industrial Age is starting to boom. You are in need of more workers for your factories, and you also need more workers to build railroad tracks to expand your railway network. This, in turn, will enable you to deliver the goods from your factories to cities with high demand &mdash; but be sure to earmark goods for fulfilling profitable public contracts because when the connection to Trieste is made, your net worth is all that matters.&#10;&#10;Imperial Steam is a highly strategic yet accessible economic and logistics game that sees you making difficult decisions as you manage your business's operations while navigating fierce competition to ensure your victory!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/detq5U6nwb3WDd8ecKex_A__original/img/xiKG0vlm8yAd2EblILmPZovE0X8=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic6277816.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/detq5U6nwb3WDd8ecKex_A__thumb/img/jgeeNLOzAPgJSx5q8ZC2EBApkTg=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6277816.jpg
205	106217	Hawaii	Game description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;Don't expect to lie around the sun, lazily sipping cocktails and passively watching hula dancers, because the tactical game Hawaii is not a paradise for idlers, but rather for bold, active strategists. Restlessly, they'll move their pieces on the game board, facing constant challenges in terms of making their beautiful villages on this beautiful island as profitable as possible. Only those who will be able to use their dwindling resources to meet the increasing demands over five rounds will find a spot for themselves on the beach.&#10;&#10;In Hawaii, players must make use of their limited resources to score points by growing their villages and exploring the surrounding islands. Your chieftains move around the board to purchase new tiles for their villages, hopefully grabbing the best deals before their opponents. Three different currencies are used to pay for these trips, so make sure you don't run out of any of them too quickly. Players are also rewarded for providing for their people (measured essentially by how much they bought on a given turn), but your meager income shrinks as the game goes on. Players will have to balance a number of ways to score points to secure their victory.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	5	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/9k84Frsbo6DyVaMR0mxaqA__original/img/E2FKjg1xbWTnwtgC1xRmmB-tL0M=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1188333.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/9k84Frsbo6DyVaMR0mxaqA__thumb/img/G055Yf6D124jg0uNGO_LGrerkAQ=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1188333.jpg
206	65901	Age of Industry	Martin Wallace's streamlined redesign of Brass: Lancashire.&#10;&#10;Players are tycoons in the early days of the Industrial Revolution; a time when traditional craftsman were being rapidly replaced with steam-powered machines. Players invest in the production of raw materials, the manufacture of goods, and the transportation networks needed to connect them to their markets.&#10;&#10;Like Brass, the strategic space is vast, and player decisions are limited by cards. In Age of Industry, however, cards are color-coded to regions rather than specific cities, allowing the players to be more flexible with their plans, while at the same time continuing to limit the decisions available. The color-coded region cards will also support expansion maps.&#10;&#10;In addition, the original Brass rules were simplified by eliminating the canal period; there is only one period, the railway era. There is also a new, non-specific industry, which will change with each map.&#10;&#10;According to Wallace, &quot;You can now play something with the depth of Brass, but in half the time. The game will have a double-sided map, with Germany on one side and southern New England on the other.&quot;&#10;&#10;	\N	2	5	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/F1DJ5wsTySoSTTb9E3fouQ__original/img/5cgNo6iXR7kouxeYkWYrZmtvzCg=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic715611.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/F1DJ5wsTySoSTTb9E3fouQ__thumb/img/BpkzyXVeVxZVBmac2jam5LfI4Fg=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic715611.jpg
207	82420	Summoner Wars: Guild Dwarves vs Cave Goblins	The battle ignites in the Mountains of Sorrow!&#10;&#10;The Mountains of Sorrow are aptly named, for they have been the site of the unending clash between Goblin and Dwarf. The Cave Goblins seek merely to throw themselves upon any foe with the will to fight. The Guild Dwarves sit in their mountain halls, jealously guarding their ancient riches. But with the discovery of the Summoning Stones comes a new kind of combat, and now these two great races will help set off the War for Itharia.&#10;&#10;Summoner Wars: Guild Dwarves vs. Cave Goblins gives players everything they need to join the War for Itharia, as either of these great races. Will you play the Guild Dwarves, whose knowledge of siege warfare knows no rival?

208	52461	Legacy: The Testament of Duke de Crecy	It is 1729 in pre-revolution France, a time when the aristocracy has all the power and the means to rule the country. As a wealthy, well-educated aristocrat, you have travelled the world and had the fortune to enjoy your life to the fullest &ndash; but you see that history is about to change course and you know that in order to stay strong, your family must prepare well. You need to find new allies. You must absorb smaller families and use their potency to strengthen your kin. You have to arrange wise marriages, nurture strong connections at court, obtain titles, build mansions, and find the right spouses for your daughters and sons...&#10;&#10;Legacy: The Testament of Duke de Crecy enables you to build a powerful dynasty in 18th century France as you step into the shoes of a French noble and compete for lasting honor. Over three generations, you &ndash; a resourceful patriarch or matriarch &ndash; will attempt to create a lasting legacy by establishing a house with ties to many different wealthy and powerful families from France and abroad (Spain, Italy, Russia and other countries).&#10;&#10;This card game offers endless possibilities. Each time you build a family, you write a unique story, bringing to life the diverse relationships between parents and their children, between cousins, uncles, aunts, nephews and nieces. Whether you are looking for the best husband for your only daughter or a suitable wife for one of your two sons, whether you are looking to add new blood to your family by marrying into foreign nobility &ndash; you will be working to make your family rise in status through prestige and wealth, new skills and abilities.&#10;&#10;In Legacy: The Testament of Duke de Crecy &ndash; known previously as Nobles of Paris and winner of Ducosim Spelontwerp in 2009 &ndash; you will find 75 spouse cards with unique traits, more than twenty secret missions, nine titles, and nine &quot;contribution to the family&quot; cards. This all culminates in a highly thematic card game that will satisfy players who enjoy exploring many different paths to victory.&#10;&#10;&#10;Legacy is a worker placement game in which you take actions to improve the standing and/or wealth of your family. You will expand your family, creating an ever-growing tableau, the family tree. You will need to balance the three 'currencies' in the game, Prestige (converts to Honor points at the end of each generation, of which there are three), Income (your income which converts to hard cash at the end of each round, of which there are 9), and Friend cards (which are actual connections/friends, and are the only way to marry into wealthy/famous families, and can only be received through actions, such as  marrying a woman who brings some of her social contacts with her).&#10;&#10;Prestige, Income and Friend cards can be gained and lost. You can, for example, lose some prestige by marrying someone infamous or lose some Honor points (i.e. reputation) by asking friends for money. There are also numerous actions you can take that will affect one of the three 'currencies' detrimentally, such as bribing someone to get a title (for which you need to pay, but also in the loss of friends who felt they deserved that title, and not you), or the maintenance of a beautiful new park you have built for the people (losing you income). Finally, you can also take actions that result in the loss of some of your social contacts (friends), due to jealousy, or people simply no longer wanting to be associated with you.&#10;&#10;These currencies are carefully balanced by the male and female friend cards in the game. Generally men will give you income and possibly prestige, but will cost you a dowry/wedding costs. Women, on the other hand, will give you connections (new friends you can choose from the current socialites (cards lying open on the table) and possibly prestige, and will sometimes even earn you a dowry!&#10;&#10;The card interactions allow for multiple different paths to success, but you must choose your road strategically, planning out where you want to be headed, else you will be left behind in the dust by those with greater and more successful plans than yours.&#10;&#10;	\N	1	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/JmSr31JYYIsUzZvzoouR3g__original/img/9XXVnIRYKVUGvt4Tjr7qOOyWfcU=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic6973749.png	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/JmSr31JYYIsUzZvzoouR3g__thumb/img/hB5yQbX0zzzaMYnuXRIrfOAW5YM=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6973749.png

210	281466	Yedo: Deluxe Master Set	The deluxe edition features:&#10;&#10;- Updated artwork&#10;- All components upgraded to true deluxe&#10;- You will be able to &quot;set up&rdquo; your own experience of YEDO. Whether you want no negative interaction or a game more punishing than ever before, you will be able to set up YEDO to suit your needs and pause play style.&#10;- New modular components brings a lot of interesting mechanisms into Yedo: the Tea house with a set of unique helpers who'll join you for a turn, Specialists in place of regular Disciples, new types of missions and much, much more!&#10;&#10;About the game:&#10;Japan, 1605 &ndash; Hidetada Tokugawa has succeeded his father as the new Shogun, ruling from the great city of Edo (a.k.a. Yedo), the city known in present times as Tokyo. This marks the beginning of the golden age of the Tokugawa Shogunate and the so-called Edo Period that will last until 1868. Naturally, the most powerful families in Edo immediately try to curry favor with the new Shogun &ndash; and this is the opportunity our clan has been looking for, our chance at power and glory. Our clan will prove ourselves to be indispensable to the new Shogun. We will work from the shadows to acquire information about our rival clans. We will kidnap those who might oppose our ascent and assassinate those who prove a threat. We will use cunning to prevent our adversaries from doing the same to us. We will find glory and honor in the eyes of this new Shogun &ndash; or failing that we will end his rule by any means necessary.&#10;&#10;In the strategy game Yedo, players assume the roles of Clan Elders in the city of Edo during the early years of the Tokugawa Shogunate. The object of the game is to amass Prestige Points, mainly by completing missions. To do so, players must gather the necessary assets and &ndash; most importantly &ndash; outfox their opponents and prevent them from completing their missions.&#10;&#10;There are several ways to reach your goal. Will you try to complete as many missions as possible and hope that your efforts catch the Shogun's eye? Or will you choose a more subtle way of gaining power by trying to influence the Shogun during a private audience? You can also put your rivals to shame by buying lots of luxury goods from the European merchants. It's all up to you &ndash; but be careful to make the right choices, for in Yedo, eternal glory and painful disgrace are two sides of the same coin&#10;&#10;	\N	1	5	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/xWiLk8PDqiLiDHQYteXQSQ__original/img/WDyiPfF2o3tGcRZqEdZL6ZKLMbU=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic6869289.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/xWiLk8PDqiLiDHQYteXQSQ__thumb/img/Svbj9nFxHC_T6PiqWD9VWSOqGII=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6869289.jpg

214	227515	Riverboat	Riverboat posits each player as the owner of a 19th century farm on the bank of the Mississippi River. You need to organize your workers to ensure that the fields are ordered according to their type and harvested when ready so that the goods can be shipped to New Orleans.&#10;&#10;In more detail, the game lasts four rounds, and at the start of each round players draft phase cards until they're all distributed. The phases then take place in numerical order, with the player who chose a phase being the first one to act. In the first phase, players place their workers in the fields, with each player having the same distribution of colored field tiles, but a different random placement for each player. In phase two, players organize their crops, trying to group like types together, with some fields requiring two or three workers. In phase three, players harvest crops and load riverboats, with a dock needing to be filled with all the goods of a single type before it can be loaded. In phase four, the boats are launched and players can take special actions, with additional victory points possibly coming in phase five.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/2sERfmFw2sWOkeIKBNlpkg__original/img/_eT0mk8OHuBJR1J697vCbgbv--c=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic3812239.png	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/2sERfmFw2sWOkeIKBNlpkg__thumb/img/Wd71rMfkQuT9JD21wnyBMfC8Bw4=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3812239.png
215	66056	Rivals for Catan	The Rivals for Catan is a reimplementation of Catan Card Game.&#10;&#10;The Rivals for Catan was released in German in September of 2010, on the 15th anniversary of the original card game. An English edition was released in the fourth quarter of 2010. The designer of the game, Klaus Teuber, has stated that he completely reworked many of the original card game's mechanics to make it easier for newcomers to play the game.&#10;&#10;Each player portrays a prince for Catan, developing their individual provinces and competing to build a more successful province than the other.  The basic mode of play is similar to the original Catan Card Game, where players expand their provinces by building settlements connected by roads.  Players may also build expansions in their settlements that aid them in various ways, or upgrade their settlements to cities to allow more expansions to be built.  They build these additions by using resources that they accumulate each turn, which are determined by the roll of a die.  Cards are drawn on each turn to replenish the players' hands.  The players may also use action cards that directly affect either their own province or their opponent's province.&#10;&#10;The Rivals for Catan features a reduced pool of cards, without the more aggressive style of action cards found in the original Catan Card Game.  Therefore, all action cards will be able to be used from the beginning of the game unlike in the original card game.&#10;&#10;Ways to Play:&#10;The Introductory Game focuses on the basics of the card game, featuring gameplay that is more appropriate for newcomers.  This game is played to 7 victory points and includes 36 Expansion Cards in four stacks.  This play style should take beginner players 25 to 30 minutes to play.&#10;&#10;Three Theme Games add more rules, expansions, and aggressive cards.  These Theme Games may be played individually or combined to play a variant called &quot;The Duel of the Princes.&quot;  Each Theme Game adds 24 Expansion and Event Cards to the cards from the Introductory Game, which are placed in two stacks separately from the cards from the Introductory Game.  When playing a Theme Game, playtime should be around 45 to 60 minutes.&#10;&#10;As with the original Catan Card Game, players can also play the Tournament Game, in which each player chooses specific cards to build their deck ahead of time from which they draw from during the game.&#10;&#10;Theme:&#10;The theme of The Rivals for Catan is no longer restricted only to the feudal era of the Middle Ages like the original Catan Card Game.  The Introductory Game portrays the very early years of the world of Catan, while each Theme Game takes place in progressively later eras.  These eras are known as &quot;The Era of Gold,&quot; &quot;The Era of Turmoil,&quot; and &quot;The Era of Progress.&quot;&#10;&#10;Belongs to the Catan Series.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	2	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/n5x9eZiQ7Da4SQjB7M41-w__original/img/Y6dJpidB1624ox-QCAdiSVsCnf4=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic6877018.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/n5x9eZiQ7Da4SQjB7M41-w__thumb/img/dGMw2df-4gOwfLCdUeJceBeLCk8=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6877018.jpg

217	300217	Merchants of the Dark Road	After half a year of daylight, we must now prepare for the dark season. The roads will be treacherous but they will still need to be braved by a select few in order to keep our cities thriving. In Merchants of the Dark Road, you are one of these brave few merchants that travel the dangerous paths between cities. While the job is perilous, fame and fortune await.&#10;&#10;Discover the capital city where most of your actions will take place using a rondel action system.

Deliver goods and heroes to the best destinations and gain fame for your bravery!

218	314503	Codex Naturalis	In CODEX Naturalis, you must continue the work of the illuminating monk Tybor Kwelein, assembling the pages of a manuscript that lists the living species in primary forests. Can you put the pages together in the best order possible? And are you prepared to sacrifice a species to develop your manuscript?&#10;&#10;In the game, each player starts with a single card on the table, a card that shows some combination of the four possible resources in the middle of the card, in the corners of the card, or both. Players also have two resource cards and one gold card in hand, while two of each type of card are visible on the table.&#10;&#10;On a turn, you place a card from your hand overlapping the corners of one or more cards you already have in play. Your starting card has four overlappable corners, while resource and gold cards have only three.&#10;&#10;&#10;    Resource cards have no cost to be played, and they often depict resource symbols in their corners.&#10;    Gold cards deliver points when played, but they often have a resource requirement, e.g., three fungi or two plant/one animal/one insect, and you must have those resources visible in your manuscript at the time you play the gold card. You score points from this card immediately, with some cards having a fixed value and others a variable one depending on how many of a certain symbol are showing or how many corners you covered this turn.&#10;&#10;&#10;If you wish, you can play a card from your hand face down; such a card has four corners and one resource, but provides no points. After you play, draw a face-up card or the top card of either deck to refill your hand.&#10;&#10;When a player reaches 20 points, you complete the round, and each player takes one additional turn. Players then score points based on how well they matched two public objective cards and one secret objective card, after which the player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;	\N	1	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/0I7U0tz-RgpIFWWco5FKLA__original/img/BeNJf5TlpTDS56qdhL1lpjiyMmc=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic5612161.png	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/0I7U0tz-RgpIFWWco5FKLA__thumb/img/idWdk9oQtUtvE7G_WwWUa7qoYNE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5612161.png

If kept, the next card goes to the communal pile; if placed in the communal pile, the next card goes in your personal collection.&#10;&#10;At the start of your turn, you can decide to use a container. If so, you assemble cards from personal and communal spaces, group them, then turn them all over. You have then &quot;collected&quot; those and can't use the container again.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, collectors determine the best collection as a combination of value from their collection, matching herbs, and herb sets.&#10;&#10;	\N	1	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/0HHqYFhJvOwk8Z0Dt-EvTA__original/img/PUZECnFJTnvhRL48lpUzR5TR48w=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic7083274.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/0HHqYFhJvOwk8Z0Dt-EvTA__thumb/img/EwiBLR6QywbISk0aGe-Vya4zXws=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7083274.jpg
220	15817	Manila	Barges, freight and profits are what it's all about in Manila, a speculative contest for 3-5 players. Goods shipments, intended for transport along sea routes, are in danger of gathering dust in the warehouses or being lost at sea in a storm. While the players speculate about success and failure, the ultimate fate of the ships will be determined by the dice.&#10;&#10;There are four shipments that need to get to Manila - jade, ginseng, silk and nutmeg. A round begins with an initial auction to become harbour master. If you win, you'll be allowed to buy a share of one of the shipments, choose which three shipments you'd like to take down river and how likely they are to make it to their destination in the harbour. If they make it to Manila, their share price will increase. The aim of the game is to bet on the outcome of these shipments, with dice ultimately determining their fate. How many of the three boats will make it and which ones? Would you like to provide insurance against possible failed ships or perhaps you think pirates will snatch a chance to take control? Manila is a fun family game that takes minutes to learn and brings the river boats of the Philippines to life!&#10;&#10;	\N	3	5	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/dU0cm4_NP8QiQqiXP9Jclw__original/img/WxzkPQdX41PI-Lz-94wPL1ZrEQk=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic902372.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/dU0cm4_NP8QiQqiXP9Jclw__thumb/img/fgRQKglhHBKsRP-nUi0EE-iuxvM=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic902372.jpg
221	270971	Era: Medieval Age	Era: Medieval Age serves as the spiritual successor to Roll Through The Ages. While Roll Through The Ages was a pioneer for roll-and-write-style games, Era is a pioneer for roll-and-build!&#10;&#10;In Era, your dice represent different classes of medieval society as players attempt to build the most prosperous city. The &quot;build&quot; comes into play as players actually build their cities on their boards. You will use beautifully modeled three-dimensional components such as walls, keeps, farms, and other structures. By the end of the game, each player will have a unique city of their very own!&#10;&#10;Era: Medieval Age is made even more challenging as players interact with each other in ways such as extortion, scorched earth, and, of course, disease! Hey, this is the Medieval Age, right? Speaking of which, Era serves as the first of a new series of standalone roll-and-build games from Matt Leacock and eggertspiele!&#10;&#10;	\N	1	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/WMo5maeCJg0ow-KMyMw7Rg__original/img/8_ATGCcWlAPp72H6XpGfrBWXGEI=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4547154.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/WMo5maeCJg0ow-KMyMw7Rg__thumb/img/Prjny2hfmFhRa81eaP3Mnu9k83k=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4547154.jpg
222	354934	Legacy of Yu	During the reign of Emperor Yao, the people of ancient China were constantly plagued by deadly floods along the Yellow River. Eager to put an end to the devastation, Yao selected Gun, one of his officials, to devise a plan. After nine years of failed attempts using dams and dikes, Gun's employment came to a questionable end. After his passing, Yu inherited his father's work. Learning from Gun's failures, Yu set out to construct a series of canals to direct the surging river into nearby fields and smaller waterways.&#10;&#10;Legacy of Yu is a solo-only, fully-resettable, nonlinear campaign game in which you step into the role of the legendary hero of the Xia Dynasty, Yu the Great. It will be your job to build the canals ahead of the impending flood, while also defending your growing village against neighboring barbarian tribes. With each game, stories will be shared and new gameplay elements added. The campaign features a self-balancing system which adapts to how well you are doing. The campaign ends once you either win or lose seven games.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;	\N	1	1	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/cVE1FZQR3gqdlAmehJpaBw__original/img/F5aSQaJkh-PKGpq7I7mGFn9YFhg=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic6630422.png	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/cVE1FZQR3gqdlAmehJpaBw__thumb/img/D52Pgq1xs7MNiDjkinf4VLGroxQ=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6630422.png
223	11971	Cockroach Poker	Cockroach Poker is a reverse set collection game that has nothing to do with poker &ndash; except that the game is all about bluffing, with cards that show cockroaches, rats and stink bugs. The goal is to force another player to collect 4 of any one type of critter.&#10;&#10;The deck includes 64 cards, with eight copies of eight types of critters. To set up the game, shuffle the deck and deal the cards out to players.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player takes one card from his hand, lays it face down on the table, slides it to a player of his choice, and declares a type of critter, e.g., &quot;Stink bug&quot;. The player receiving the card either&#10;&#10;&#10;     Accepts the card, says either &quot;true&quot; or &quot;false&quot;, then reveals the card. If this player is wrong in her claim, she keeps the card on the table in front of her face up; if she is right, the player who gave her the card places it face up before him.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Peeks at the card, then passes it face down to another player, either saying the original type of critter or saying a new type. This new player again has the choice of accepting the card or passing it, unless the card has already been seen by all other players in which case the player must take the first option.&#10;&#10;&#10;Whoever lost a challenge and had to place the card before him on the table begins the next round.&#10;&#10;The game ends when a player has no cards to pass on his turn or when a player has four cards of the same critter on the table in front of him. In either case, this player loses and everyone else wins.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	6	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/lHadyVLPUQfNz_qV6MMp_Q__original/img/qN8xusrxWyTJfgq1gTUWrdE4B2I=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3218988.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/lHadyVLPUQfNz_qV6MMp_Q__thumb/img/zWiETTyIp4Xo1o0l2mtOdt3G-ls=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3218988.jpg

226	279254	Ecos: First Continent	What if the formation of Earth had gone differently?&#10;&#10;In Ecos: First Continent, players are forces of nature molding the planet, but with competing visions of its grandeur. You have the chance to create a part of the world, similar but different to the one we know. Which landscapes, habitats, and species thrive will be up to you.&#10;&#10;Gameplay in Ecos is simultaneous. Each round, one player reveals element tokens from the element bag, giving all players the opportunity to complete a card from their tableau and shape the continent to their own purpose. Elements that cannot be used can be converted into energy cubes or additional cards in hand or they can be added to your tableau to give you greater options as the game evolves.&#10;&#10;Mountain ranges, jungle, rivers, seas, islands and savanna, each with their own fauna, all lie within the scope of the players' options.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;	\N	2	6	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/MyqAq5_DX27gVQE192gZ4g__original/img/R9jnDzY4JIxQ7H7hmTGr3rSBiAA=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic4720237.png	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/MyqAq5_DX27gVQE192gZ4g__thumb/img/hu4Kc4DS5YZbywwQ_OjcbQD1iBs=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4720237.png
227	66505	The Speicherstadt	The Speicherstadt is an auction card game. Players compete for victory points, which come mainly from contracts (sets of resources) and special cards (like a collected set of 1-4 identical &quot;counting offices&quot;, the port rewarding collected ship cards etc.). The game is built on two core concepts:&#10;&#10;1. Players bid for cards by building &quot;towers&quot; with their meeples over them. Each meeple in a tower increases the cost of a card - but only for players &quot;below&quot; it. This is the main mechanic of the game - players must consider WHEN to bid (place their meeple) over a certain card and when to use their meeples to make others pay more. This is important, because a player can make only three bids during a round.&#10;&#10;2. Players are punished by negative points for not collecting firemen cards. Thus, ignoring security may cost a player a victory. By many players, the &quot;punishing&quot; mechanic is considered a trademark of the author - Stefan Feld.&#10;&#10;The deck is divided into four seasons - winter, spring, summer and autumn. In later seasons, more powerful cards appear, so players need to think ahead in managing their resources.&#10;&#10;---- Promotional blurb from the publisher ----&#10;&#10;Hamburg around 1900 - the gate to the world. Within the harbour there stretches a unique complex of storehouses: Speicherstadt. The network of canals and bridges houses a terminal for spices, coffee, tea and carpets from all over the world.&#10;&#10;As one of Hamburg&acute;s wholesaler at the heyday of the Speicherstadt you acquire shiploads for the storehouses, not too expensive, of course, as you like to make a profit selling them. Who makes the best deals within a year and supplies his clients with the right goods will be the winner of the game. But beware! Sudden fires cause heavy losses. You might be advised to invest in fire protection early.&#10;&#10;Playing Speicherstadt you will be thrilled by the simple and original mechanism of acquiring desired action cards.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	5	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/x1EVKCtIP_tFTH8h5kvXog__original/img/vghLqYXdFa8OH8fUzOJtby16khI=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic686491.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/x1EVKCtIP_tFTH8h5kvXog__thumb/img/8n5m3ZjWQfD-uwM7hOEyqS_93I4=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic686491.jpg
228	19600	Antike	From the publisher's website:&#10;Antike is a challenging strategy game about evolution and competition among ancient civilizations. Ancient nations create cities, build temples, sail the seas, and discover new principles of science and technology. Their legions and galleys open new settlements and defend their people against attacks from their enemies. Two scenarios can be chosen as the game board is two-sided. Players choose from Greeks, Romans, and Germanic tribes and Phoenicians, Carthaginians, Persians, Arabs, Egyptians, and Babylonians.&#10;&#10;Every nation tries to win ancient kings, scholars, generals, citizens, and navigators for themselves. The nation that acquires a specified number (depending on the number of players) of ancient personalities first will win the game!&#10;&#10;Lead one of these nations to victory! But watch out for your enemies, as they will want to conquer your cities to destroy your temples. The game depends not on the luck of dice or cards, but on thoughtful plans and skillful diplomacy.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	6	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/qBeZa2sdkpJYmqBXHjZWOw__original/img/TV8s-PhtTx7oE3EzkGPe5FYeV2o=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic171444.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/qBeZa2sdkpJYmqBXHjZWOw__thumb/img/-u6Eu5lO6yRRnm1XqLpL3aHtQW8=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic171444.jpg
229	554	La Città	Set in the Italian countryside, this game features various city-states vying for population.  Each player is given two cities to start with, and is charged with expanding the different aspects of the cities to attract larger populations.&#10;&#10;Players build farms to feed their people, quarries to finance their expansions, marketplaces to allow growth in their cities, and bathhouses to keep their people clean and healthy.  Additionally, structures can be built that give the city influence in one of three categories.  Superiority in one of these categories will cause population to shift from other nearby cities when the Voice of the People is decided at the end of each turn.&#10;&#10;At the end of six turns, the player with the most victory points, which are determined from well-rounded cities, well-fed populations, and overall size of population, will be the winner.&#10;&#10;Note: The correct pronunciation is like &quot;Cheetah&quot;, but with the accent on the last syllable: &quot;La Chee-TAH&quot;.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	5	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ttXTVgc8Mxr9NnOcFDEyeA__original/img/6HgOUgirKIF9hBqlACyU4Nt9-Qg=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic274350.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ttXTVgc8Mxr9NnOcFDEyeA__thumb/img/4YDgg-cOc7mdF6jMcBds_trIzAI=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic274350.jpg
230	164949	Time of Crisis: The Roman Empire in Turmoil, 235-284 AD	From the publisher's web page:&#10;&#10;During the Crisis of the Third Century, the Roman Empire nearly collapsed in the face of calamitous internal and external strife, including continuous civil war and barbarian invasions from all directions.  Beginning with the assassination of Emperor Alexander Severus, a period of 50 years saw nearly as many different men seize imperial power over all or part of the Empire, until the reforms of Diocletian in 284 AD ushered in an era of peace.&#10;&#10;In Time of Crisis, 2-4 players take the reins of Roman dynasties, gathering and wielding influence among the senate, military, and people of Rome to ensure that their legacies are remembered by history instead of being lost to the mists of time.  Starting from control of one province and a few low-value cards, you are challenged to establish your base of power during this fragile period of Roman history.  You must build your armies, take control of valuable provinces, develop your support, and defend yourself against barbarian incursions, inopportune events, and the machinations of your political opponents.&#10;&#10;Time of Crisis is easy to learn and playable in about 2-3 hours.  It incorporates popular game mechanisms such as deckbuilding and hand management, but also delivers a true light wargame experience.  The historical flavor is strong, with many meaningful decisions and opportunities presented to players on the board.  This game finally fully closes the loop between deckbuilding card games and board games.  Your cards dictate what actions are available to you on the board, and in turn, your position on the board directly determines how you can add or remove cards from your deck to make yourself stronger for future turns.  Will you specialize in manipulating the Senate, wielding the power of the Legions, or being a man of the People?  Or will you master a blend of all three?  In a twist unlike most deckbuilding games, you have the privilege of selecting the cards that compose your hand each turn!  However, you still need to eventually work through  your entire deck before you can use your cards again, so deck management and timing is critical.&#10;&#10;All of the key elements of the era are present in Time of Crisis:  civil wars between competing generals and governors, Roman legions defending the frontiers against barbarian tribes, Senate favoritism, barracks emperors, even angry mobs, inflation, the Praetorian Guard, and the ability to carve off your own piece of the Roman Empire.  Can your dynasty arise as the new leaders of the Roman Empire before Diocletian emerges and brings peace once again?&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/AzbAevS1luPIpQZgdqRJrA__original/img/niUQQ0MZL8rl1Sgi0T3jgrHUPYg=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3372197.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/AzbAevS1luPIpQZgdqRJrA__thumb/img/jvuKcxYKE49i-mqwPfI3BqFr-Dg=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3372197.jpg
231	171669	Discoveries: The Journals of Lewis & Clark	The Lewis and Clark Expedition, which was commissioned in 1803 and ended in 1806, was the first party of men that went through the North American continent, then returned. During these three years, the leaders Meriwether Lewis and William Clark, along with Sergeant Gass and Sergeant Ordway, wrote page after page about their trip, describing the new plants and animals species they discovered and drawing the maps of unknown areas.&#10;&#10;In Discoveries, you play one of the Expedition members: Lewis, Clark, Gass or Ordway. Your goal is to compile as much knowledge as possible in your journal, and in this way advance science thanks to your discoveries.&#10;&#10;The Tribe/Discoveries cards you gain during the game score discovery points at the end. To get these cards, you have to perform exploration actions, and to do this you use dice. On your turn, you either:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Play the dice in your action area or on the game board; by doing this, you prepare or perform the exploration, change your dice, or get new possible actions.&#10;    Get dice back from the game board or from your opponents' action areas.&#10;&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/3OjspN1BMrUEL1YN-Q8UKQ__original/img/TDdGcOgqmW-ZhEu6ja98GwEkJgI=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2571301.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/3OjspN1BMrUEL1YN-Q8UKQ__thumb/img/no8Q5IdChPD2Fx1YyDNn_xJyRqw=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2571301.jpg
232	276894	Ticket to Ride: London	Ticket to Ride: London features the familiar gameplay from the Ticket to Ride game series &mdash; collect cards, claim routes, draw tickets &mdash; but on a scaled-down map of 1970s London that allows you to complete a game in no more than 15 minutes.&#10;&#10;Each player starts with a supply of 17 double-decker buses, two transportation cards in hand, and one or two destination tickets that show locations in London. On a turn, you either draw two transportation cards from the deck or the display of five face-up cards (or you take one face-up bus, which counts as all six colors in the game); or you claim a route on the board by discarding cards that match the color of the route being claimed (with any set of cards allowing you to claim a gray route); or you draw two destination tickets and keep at least one of them.&#10;&#10;Players take turns until someone has no more than two buses in their supply, then each player takes one final turn, including the player who triggered the end of the game. Players then sum their points, scoring points for (1) the routes that they've claimed during the game, (2) the destination tickets that they've completed (by connecting the two locations on a ticket by a continuous line of their buses), and (3) the districts that they've connected. (A district consists of 2-4 locations, and you score 1-5 points for a district if you link all of its locations to one another with your buses.) You lose points for any uncompleted destination tickets, then whoever has the high score wins!&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/gJq8JOmOmmZSFpbrWGQMDQ__original/img/nrik6K05TtQl7RSfCD-syaOnBoU=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic4666620.png	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/gJq8JOmOmmZSFpbrWGQMDQ__thumb/img/kjppa8fi_pMWlWpMVfC6xAMgec8=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4666620.png
233	8203	Hey, That's My Fish!	In Hey, That's My Fish!, players want to catch as many fish as possible with their waddle of penguins. Each turn, a player moves one penguin in a straight line over hex-shaped ice tiles with 1, 2 or 3 fish on them. The player then collects the hex from where the penguin started its movement from the table, thereby creating a gap which penguins can't cross on future turns. When a penguin can't move, it's removed from play with its owner claiming the tile on which it stands. The player who collects the most fish wins.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/aEtNj7BH3PDwjOcylyDx6w__original/img/3qds684KEL3fDTVuV3mxydxLhyU=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic7563283.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/aEtNj7BH3PDwjOcylyDx6w__thumb/img/rwsIZDzVir-gRUFkM7OZT2OifHk=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7563283.jpg
234	242684	Reavers of Midgard	Reavers of Midgard is a single worker placement game with elements of set collection, dice combat and engine building set in the Champions of Midgard universe.&#10;&#10;In Champions of Midgard, your quest was to become Jarl.  You battled back the trolls, draugr and some of the epic monsters that once threatened the sanctity of your humble port town.  Now it's time to go on the offensive.&#10;&#10;In Reavers of Midgard, you'll be looking to gain glory by raiding nearby villages for their riches, sacking well-fortified castles and battling both man and monster on the open seas. You'll not only need to take your rowdy crew of vikings and the food needed to keep them happy along for the ride but you'll also have to recruit a crew of elite warriors - the Reavers.&#10;&#10;Reavers can be used in three different ways. They can be made your ship's leader, earning you a one-time bonus and enabling your warriors to be more versatile in combat. They can also be used to rally more warriors to your cause, filling your ship to the brim with the right fighters for the right situations. Finally, they can also be used to help your crew specialize, earning you a bonus every time your crew sails into battle.&#10;&#10;Whoever can earn the most glory after six rounds will be the winner.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/RCV5d4ZMgzm20MosK3zADQ__original/img/TQBvSyATFkPKRmILIC14phaxpfQ=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic3916976.png	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/RCV5d4ZMgzm20MosK3zADQ__thumb/img/MYsrcgv_ztbdhHkSboUN4jfOJjo=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3916976.png
235	178336	World's Fair 1893	The World's Fair of 1893 in Chicago was a spectacular international exhibition that showcased many great achievements in science, technology, culture, and entertainment. Acting as organizers of the fair, players work diligently to increase their influence throughout the fair and obtain the grand exhibits that will be put on display. The organizer who has earned the best reputation when the fair begins will emerge the victor.&#10;&#10;On each turn of World's Fair 1893, the active player sends a supporter to one of the five areas and gathers all of the cards in it. New cards are then added to some of the areas, and the next player takes a turn.&#10;&#10;The five areas represent sections of exhibits, like Fine Arts and Electricity. Cards may represent exhibit proposals in one of those five areas, influential people who provide bonus supporters, or tickets for attractions and concessions along the Midway.&#10;&#10;The game consists of three scoring rounds, each triggered when players collectively gather a certain number of Midway tickets. Players gain reputation points for leading in number of supporters in an area and for gathering the most tickets in each round. The leaders in an area also receive approval for exhibit proposals they have gathered that match the area. Players gain reputation points at the end of the game based on the breadth and diversity of their approved exhibits.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/iHERVAfyVClk_eNT6noIlg__original/img/_kR0iKFzRApg-2TyikSMMu_qJAQ=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic2721792.png	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/iHERVAfyVClk_eNT6noIlg__thumb/img/Za-pR3Js9cMJ_CoAdy6ET1F__-0=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2721792.png
236	299169	Spicy	Once upon a time, three big cats became exhausted fighting to be top cat. They agreed to quit the fight and spice up their nine lives with a hot spice eating contest. Alas, everyone was soon cheating, so the cats invented a very hot, often tearful, bluffing game.&#10;&#10;Spicy is a bluffing card game for 2-6 players. The cards are played face down, so you can cheat when you announce your card. That said, this clever card game isn't just about bluffing for you can almost always play a card that is at least half right if you cleverly play your hand. This means tactically deciding which card to use to get through: Do I play a &quot;Pepper 10&quot; or a color wild on a &quot;Wasabi 9&quot; and declare it a &quot;Wasabi 10&quot;?

237	241590	Smart10	Smart10 is a quiz game where a player doesn't need to wait for one's turn for long. &#10;There are ten possible answers to each question, and every player gets to answer every question. &#10;If the answer is correct, the player gets an answer marker. &#10;But should you answer or pass?&#10;If you don't score your answer markers on time (and thereby pass on this round), you can end up losing them.&#10;So if you are not 100% certain of an answer - do you gamble or do you pass?&#10;Plays great in teams.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	8	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/pwa0lKfmlE4PvFo-YVxrLQ__original/img/M-q1H7vjciksvgG4H73R8W-Zq70=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4945756.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/pwa0lKfmlE4PvFo-YVxrLQ__thumb/img/4RXK5M7g8_GRW_2HjyLdTjS3_fw=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4945756.jpg
238	224	History of the World	History of the World works under the assumptions that all empires eventually fade and that the only things differentiating great empires from lesser ones is how much territory they conquer and how long it takes for their civilizations to disappear.  The game is played out over 7 epochs or rounds, from the ancient 3000 B.C. Sumerians to the pre-WW1 Germany, with every player controlling a new rising empire from history.  Some empires are stronger than others (like the Romans), but the game's clever mechanisms can help balance that out.  At the end of each epoch, players score points for all units of their color (from both the current and any previous empires) remaining on the board.&#10;&#10;Before the start of their turn a player may play up to two Event cards from their hand.  The Events played are resolved before the player starts his Empire's actions.  If the player's active Empire has navigation a ship token is placed in each sea or ocean listed (if an ocean is listed all adjacent seas to the ocean have ship markers put into them).  A Reallocation Greater Event allows an Empire with Navigation to exchange Fleets in seas and oceans for Coins that can be used to buy back defeated troops (1 coin per troop).  If the active Empire has a capitol it is taken and placed in the Empire's starting land with one unit of the Empire's available troops.  Since each land space may only contain one troop the player begins expanding from their starting land by placing troops in any adjacent land space that they wish to occupy or conquer.  To conquer a land the attacker moves one unit into the land space either from adjacent land or through a sea with a ship in it.  Then dice are rolled, the attacker gets 2 dice and the defender only one, unless the attacker traveled across a strait or the defender's land has either a forest, the great wall of China, or mountains on the border of the land that the attacker came from.  In this case the defender receives 2 dice as well.  If the attack comes from the sea the defender gets 3 dice for defense.  Highest score wins with ties killing off both the defender and attacker.  In this case the attacker can merely place the next troop, if he has any left, in the now-empty land space.&#10;&#10;At any time the active Empire player may exchange an unplaced troop for a fort.  On later turns, a fort gives the player a +1 to defensive rolls in that land.  Also, if the defender in a fort loses or ties with an attacker only the fort is removed and the battle continues.  Whenever an army conquers a land with a capitol the capitol mini is flipped reducing it to a city (if it was a city to begin with it is removed from board when conquered).  After the active player's Empire is finished with it's actions check to see if it conquered to land spaces with resource symbols, if so it can build a monument.&#10;&#10;Then scoring takes place.  Each area (Middle-East, Northern Europe, Eurasia, etc...) has a tile with 3 values for the current Epoch.  One value is for having a presence in the area (at least one land).  Another value is for having Dominance in the area (at least 2 lands and more than any other player in area). The last value is for having Control of an area (at least 3 lands and no other player has any in area).  These values vary from Epoch to Epoch and Area to Area (Middle-East is more valuable in early Epochs and fades in later Epochs, for example).  Total the scores from each area for all pieces of the player's color from all Empires controlled that remain on board.  Then add 2 points for each capitol controlled, 1 point per city and one point for each monument controlled. After all areas are scored the next Empire called takes its turn.&#10;&#10;After all players have taken their turns and scored, for the first Epoch, the player with the highest score gets to take a pre-eminence marker and places it in front of him.  These are secret bonus points (worth somewhere from 3 to 6) for the end of the game and may not be examined till then.  This bonus to leader helps balance the Empire-draw mechanic and makes it valuable to score maximal points even early in the game, rather than tanking to get a better draw later. Then drawing begins for the next Epoch with the player having the lowest score drawing first on up to the person with the highest score drawing last (and likely being given a less than optimal Empire by another player).&#10;&#10;After the last player has scored for Epoch 7 and the leader has drawn a pre-eminence marker, all players reveal their pre-eminence markers and add them to their scores.  The player with the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;	\N	3	6	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/2pr-83ghWQUlwXSLuSTCtw__original/img/_MRG_pnmZQwScJWus84gwaXNflE=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic287451.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/2pr-83ghWQUlwXSLuSTCtw__thumb/img/4XPSkcdNf6CXGWsDGSRXrP7VUBc=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic287451.jpg
239	1382	Winner's Circle	A lively game of horse racing where players bet on several of seven horses to try to gain the most money by the end of three races.&#10;&#10;Winner's Circle is a re-issue of Knizia's Turf Horse Racing (published by Gibsons Games). This new version has updated graphics and uses the same mechanism of 4 symbols on the horse cards also appearing on the die. Players roll the die and choose which horse they want to move (from those that haven't moved this turn yet). The seven horses vary in strength, but even the weakest horses have some amazing bursts of speed. Players bet on the horses before each race and must either cooperate or compete to get their horses over the finish line.&#10;&#10;There are various differences between Winner's Circle and Turf Horse Racing. There are only 3 races instead of 4. The circuit is oval instead of a straight line. The horses start on separate starting spaces instead of all together on the same space. During the race, horses cannot share spaces so if a horse has to move to an occupied space, they have to move back to the last available space. A Pace chip has been added to space 18 where the first horse to pass it receives it and earns a higher payout at the end of the race (if they finish top 3). Also, there is a variant where the betting is done secretly with players using a 0 betting chip (for bluffing) in addition to the 1, 1, and 2 betting chips of the basic game.&#10;&#10;Originally called &quot;Royal Turf&quot; but was then republished by Face 2 Face Games as &quot;Winner's Circle&quot; in 2006.&#10;&#10;&quot;Royal Turf&quot; is #2 in the Alea small box series.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	6	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/oS9H9GsVkOuS0B40bT5V8g__original/img/tKMXXehPoVnH0QGldWdtUlsoNgk=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic7745780.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/oS9H9GsVkOuS0B40bT5V8g__thumb/img/Fa-16jnJ8nLVVtT19JBefYZ0Tzg=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7745780.jpg

241	218509	Empires of the Void II	The Kurross Empire emerged from the deep, endless pool of space, dark and undetectable. They crushed Earth&rsquo;s paltry fleet within a week, and broke through the great planetary shield that protected the surface. Bright blue oceans turned to an irradiated wasteland as they bombarded the planet, shredding the remnants of thousands of years of human history. Markan, last captain of Earth&rsquo;s forces, made a final, desperate attempt to survive, salvaging an abandoned Worldship from hundreds of years past. She took command and headed for the fringe of the galaxy, where there was a chance to gain a foothold, grow in strength, and find new allies for the fight against the Kurross. Earth&rsquo;s long-time enemies, the Zun and Decima Empires, soon followed in their own Worldships, leaving behind decimated worlds and lost family, determined to stake their own claim of the fringe.&#10;&#10;In Empires of the Void II, you have been given a mission  to establish a foothold at the fringe of the galaxy for your galactic empire. The game begins when your massive Worldships reach the fringe, where you must explore, wage war, use diplomacy, and construct buildings to gain victory. The fringe is sparsely populated and the few local sentient species are struggling to survive, leaving huge regions of planets open for exploration and colonization. Many species are eager to ally themselves with a powerful empire to gain security and stability in a chaotic and difficult time.&#10;&#10;As you explore and interact with planets, you will discover unfolding stories of the fringe. Each inhabited planet is home to a unique alien species, with their own goals, values, and problems. Will you give aid by fighting off pirates, transporting goods, and curing strange diseases? Or will you invade and rule with a cruel hand? This may be your last chance to prepare before the Kurross meet you again.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	5	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Nf-Ct6JAgZU8GDycOvU1JQ__original/img/rNrFQhMhDXQgJgA483uDYqyd0Fw=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3762134.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Nf-Ct6JAgZU8GDycOvU1JQ__thumb/img/7sukhQsGSenns7guA_cazIjTM-s=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3762134.jpg

243	241266	Little Town	In Little Town, you lead a team of architects and must dispatch workers to the town, collect resources and money, build buildings, and develop this little town.&#10;&#10;In the game, which lasts four rounds, you can acquire resources such as wood, stones, fish, and wheat from the surrounding squares by putting workers on the board, with three workers being placed each round. When you place a worker, you acquire the resources available in all eight surrounding spaces. You can build buildings by using these resources, and you &mdash; or any other player &mdash; can gain the effect of the building when place a worker next to it; if you place next to a building owned by another, however, you must pay them a coin before you can collect those resources.&#10;&#10;Players collect victory points by using the powers of buildings, by constructing buildings, and by achieving goals dealt to them at the beginning of the game.

244	161882	Irish Gauge	Irish Gauge &mdash; one of three titles in Winsome Games 2014 Essen Set &mdash; is played on a map of Ireland and is similar in style to many of the stock-based, cube-rail games released by Winsome Games since 2007.&#10;&#10;On each player's turn, they can either place a share of one of five companies up for auction, build track (represented by cubes) in one of these five companies, upgrade a town to a city, or call for dividends. The dividends are paid out to shareholders of certain railroads based on how many cities/towns they connect to and how many shares of this company have been issued. The upgrade and dividend actions also affect game length and the likelihood of further dividends for each company. The game ends when a certain condition is met at the end of a player's turn, and the player with the highest sum of money and stock value at the end of this turn wins.&#10;&#10;Irish Gauge is the first title in the Iron Rail series by Capstone Games.&#10;&#10;	\N	3	5	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/BZW9WTKwGMfb3R4EELel3w__original/img/K3rGKFzRT3m1MAgyAUQaDXdnFMM=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic7628587.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/BZW9WTKwGMfb3R4EELel3w__thumb/img/FowoMM52tGgX2JSUsKFaeuTsM2s=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7628587.jpg
245	204027	Cottage Garden	In Cottage Garden, you compete in the art of gardening and are working two beds with a variety of flowers. Whenever no unplanted box is visible on a bed, you have completed it, then you count your points and replace it with a fresh, unplanted bed. You gain points for all of the visible plant pots and planting bells.&#10;&#10;In more detail, players select various polyomino tiles of flower beds from a central market grid, depending on the location of the &quot;gardener&quot;, then place them on one of their two personal garden boards. Each board has several garden elements that are worth points when not planted over, and these are scored on two different tracks as soon as a garden has been finished. Crossing over a line on each track awards bonus tokens that can fill in empty spaces or give you a better selection of the flower bed tiles. Whenever a garden is finished, you receive a new one to complete. After the gardener completes her fifth lap around the market, the game enters its last round. The player with the most points from their completed gardens at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;Cottage Garden is the first part of Uwe Rosenberg's puzzle trilogy.&#10;&#10;	\N	1	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/7Zk5_GsYycmHYD4RN3kIJQ__original/img/LbvQO9zKGNFn9UKo_adUsarRarQ=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3499059.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/7Zk5_GsYycmHYD4RN3kIJQ__thumb/img/feLpplY6_MLKO4Tzfj5N2bW4a9o=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3499059.jpg
246	297129	Jekyll vs. Hyde	Jekyll vs. Hyde is a trick-taking game for two players based on the famous novella Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde by Robert Louis Stevenson. As Dr. Jekyll, you'll need to resist Mr. Hyde's fierce attacks to protect your mind and keep the secret of your dual nature. As Mr. Hyde, your goal is to dominate Dr. Jekyll to overcome his identity.&#10;&#10;One player is Dr. Jekyll ; the other is Mr. Hyde. The game plays in three rounds. At the end of each round, Dr. Jekyll's identity will progressively disappear under Mr. Hyde's relentless attacks.  Compare the number of tricks that each player has won in this round and subtract the lowest score from the highest one (for instance, if Dr. Jekyll won 6 tricks and Mr. Hyde won 4 tricks, then the final result is 6-4=2). This result indicates by how many spaces the Identity Marker will move to Mr. Hyde's side.&#10;&#10;Evil is relentless! Even if Dr. Jekyll won more tricks that Mr. Hyde, the marker will progress towards Mr. Hyde's side. As Dr. Jekyll, your goal is to keep balance, without giving in to darkness!&#10;&#10;If the marker reaches the last space of the track (far left), then Mr. Hyde instantly wins the game. Otherwise, start a new round: remove the three colored tokens from the board and reshuffle all cards, including the 5 cards that you set aside at the beginning of this round.&#10;&#10;Mr. Hyde wins as soon as the Identity Marker reaches the last space of the Identity Track (far left). If the marker did not reach the end of the track after three rounds, then Dr. Jekyll wins, escaping from Mr. Hyde's dark influence.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	2	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/b7ElE00K6FojMB77rDy7cg__original/img/epKMMRAsQpT-mq7w0qbPzUb1n7o=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5316646.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/b7ElE00K6FojMB77rDy7cg__thumb/img/LNClbXOX3nJ_M2uEgXzPFgLRso0=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5316646.jpg

248	141517	A Study in Emerald	A Study in Emerald is a game for two to five players based on the award-winning short story of the same name by Neil Gaiman. In this stylistic mash-up of Sherlock Holmes and H.P. Lovecraft, the worst has already happened and the world is now ruled by the Old Ones. However, a secret war is being fought to free mankind from their servitude. The game A Study in Emerald fleshes out this core idea by including historical figures from the late nineteenth century, most being persons involved in the anarchist movement of the time.&#10;&#10;Deck-building forms the core of the game. You use influence cubes to bid for the right to draft cards and take control of cities. Each player has a secret identity, either a Restorationist fighting against the creatures or a Loyalist attempting to defend the status quo. Which side you are on determines what you score points for. An additional twist is that the performance of other players on the same side as you can stop you from winning if they are doing particularly badly, so you really want to know who is on which side. More specifically, when the game ends &ndash; and this can result from multiple causes, such as a marker on the War or Revolution track hitting 15 or the assassination of a Restorationist player agent &ndash; then the sides compare their scores; which side has the lowest score automatically loses, then the player with the highest score on the remaining team wins the game.&#10;&#10;The game takes around ninety minutes to play and is more complex than most, so more suitable for the experienced gamer.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	5	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/W_t-KinDa1Ag3JsZrMWMVw__original/img/uxlCFZBzr0LAge9KmQ-I6DKVVDw=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1638689.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/W_t-KinDa1Ag3JsZrMWMVw__thumb/img/rzgzAAHJZFQ7rSIHxWwiKUJu9hY=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1638689.jpg
249	191300	Archaeology: The New Expedition	Archaeology: The New Expedition is a reimplementation of the popular Archaeology: The Card Game (with several changes).&#10;&#10;You are an archaeologist working the dig sites of the Egyptian desert. Search for the right pieces to complete torn parchments, broken pots, and other priceless artifacts. Explore an ancient pyramid in the hope of uncovering a huge stash of treasure! Trade shrewdly at the local marketplace to increase the value of your collection. Sell your treasures to the museum at just the right time for maximum profit.&#10;&#10;But beware, the desert also has its dangers! A devastating sandstorm can throw your expedition into disarray, and cunning thieves lurk around the dig site ready to steal your prize discovery!&#10;&#10;In Archaeology: The New Expedition, you want to find treasures and make the most money possible by selling them to the museum. Players start with four treasure cards in hand; one monument tile is chosen at random, then the chambers of the monument are loaded secretly with treasure cards.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player digs for treasure by drawing from the deck. If they find treasure, they don't show anyone and keep it; if they find a thief, they steal a card at random from an opponent; and if they find a sandstorm, all players lose half of their cards in hand to the marketplace, which starts the game with five face-up cards. (Each player has a tent that they can discard to avoid the effects of one sandstorm.) After digging, a player can:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Discard one or more maps to explore one chamber of the monument, looking at all the cards there and keeping some number of them.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Trade at the marketplace by laying down one or more treasure cards and picking up cards with equal or lesser trading value.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Sell to the museum by placing sets of treasure cards in front of them; in general, the more cards you have of a type, the more the set is worth.&#10;&#10;&#10;Players can explore only once, but they can do the other actions repeatedly, and they can take these actions in any order. Once the deck is empty, players keep taking actions until they all pass in turn, after which they sell treasures to the museum. Whoever ends up with the most money wins!&#10;&#10;According to the designer, Archaeology: The New Expedition differs from Archaeology: The Card Game through the inclusion of tent cards, the addition of new treasure types and additional cards to allow for five players, the adjustment of some treasure values, and the inclusion of six monuments instead of one to have more variety when exploring.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	5	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/5fsW7qzvnkg8L0iVx_AM1A__original/img/4EIwkLf_b6eVmziTozPeDKKOymc=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic2805898.png	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/5fsW7qzvnkg8L0iVx_AM1A__thumb/img/kDJbSE0lHm1iNprMUGjjJXzi8bM=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2805898.png

536	172081	Burgle Bros.	Burgle Bros. is a cooperative game for 1-&shy;4 players. Players are unique members of a crew trying to pull off a robbery of a highly secure building &mdash; without getting caught. The building has three floors (4x4 tiles), each with its own safe to crack. Players start on the first floor and have to escape to their helicopter waiting on the roof.&#10;&#10;Players each have three stealth tokens. Whenever they are on the same tile with a guard, they lose one. If any player is caught without a stealth token, the game is over.

252	174570	Legendary Encounters: A Predator Deck Building Game	Legendary Encounters: A Predator Deck Building Game is based on the first two movies of the Predator series. Taking on the roles of characters from the films, players take turns recruiting cards for their deck from a central selection in order to improve their deck and defeat Predator cards that are added to the central game board.&#10;&#10;In more detail, within the setting for each film you can play as the humans or as the Predators. As the humans, you play the co-op version of the game as in Legendary Encounters: Alien, recruiting, scanning and attacking the same way while trying to achieve objectives. When you play as the Predators, the game is player vs. player instead of co-op, with each player assuming the role of a Predator hunting for the most honor (VPs).&#10;&#10;Legendary Encounters: A Predator Deck Building Game is a standalone game in the Legendary Encounters series that is fully compatible with Legendary Encounters: An Alien Deck Building Game. Specifically, you can use the Predator deck in Alien or the Alien deck in Predator. Similarly, Predator is also compatible with the Marvel superheroes version of Legendary but cannot be fully integrated.&#10;&#10;	\N	1	5	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/L6RumTcXM5O7_QFahBtDlQ__original/img/Gy_9vzTaYypG6Tvyn2bwEvgfTzo=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic2486937.png	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/L6RumTcXM5O7_QFahBtDlQ__thumb/img/pOIf0DDBXcSHxKuxlS9NvdYLxoY=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2486937.png

254	72287	Mr. Jack Pocket	From Bruno Faidutti's site:&#10;&#10;It has been found again by Bruno Cathala and Ludovic Maublanc with Mr.Jack Pocket, the small card game derived from Mr. Jack. The board is replaced by a square grid made of nine street cards. The suspects, and among them Mr.Jack, are pictured on the cards. Holmes, Watson and a dog are turning around the grid, a system already used by Bruno Cathala in several games, and can &ldquo;look&rdquo; at the streets in a row or column. Every round, like in Mr.Jack, four actions are available. The first player selects one, his opponent two, and the first player then uses the last remaining action. Actions allow moving a detective one or two spaces clockwise around the grid, turning a card in order to change the view of the streets, swapping two street cards or drawing an alibi card. At the end of the round, Mr.Jack states if he can be seen by one of the detectives. Of course, the detectives must identify Jack, who must stay hidden long enough to escape.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	2	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/nd44m6n6ykDCsHVt4wcEcQ__original/img/9GFcbKuPOzXXMli4QcQFTBJaKDU=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1519530.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/nd44m6n6ykDCsHVt4wcEcQ__thumb/img/wpEJcfEdHyXDW1Kh3xbevgW2JuA=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1519530.jpg

Each school day one of the penguins is designated to watch over the school, and this is his moment to shine &ndash; for each rascal penguin he catches he would get additional fish!&#10;&#10;A fun run takes place &ndash; the rascals are running everywhere and trying to snatch some fish on their way, but the Hall Monitor is trying to catch each and one of them to have some order in the school. Who will be more successful?&#10;&#10;ICECOOL is a flicking game in which each round one of the players takes the role of the Hall Monitor (also called &quot;the Catcher&quot;) &ndash; his aim will be to catch each other penguin and get points for that. The others (also known as &quot;Runners&quot;) will try to run through several doors, thus gaining fish (that give them points) on their way. When either the Hall Monitor has caught each other penguin once or any of the others has gone through all 3 doors that have fish on them, the round is over. Each player will take the role of the Hall Monitor once and at the end of the game the winner will be the one with the most points on their fish cards.&#10;&#10;The penguins can be flicked in a straight line, make curves and even jump over the walls!

256	163154	Falling Sky: The Gallic Revolt Against Caesar	Late Summer, 54 BC:  In a series of brilliant and brutal campaigns, Caesar has seized Gaul for Rome. But not all tribes rest subdued. In the north, the Belgic leader Ambiorix springs a trap on unwary legions while Caesar is away. In the south, an ambitious son of the Arverni seeks to unite a Celtic confederation in revolt against the hated Romans. And what of the influential Aedui? Their republic appears content to shelter under Roman protection &ndash; but can they be trusted any further than any other Gauls? Meanwhile, along the Rhine, Germanic warbands multiply...&#10;&#10;Falling Sky: The Gallic Revolt Against Caesar, formerly Gallic War, takes 1 to 4 players into the military actions and complex politics of Roman-occupied but not-yet-conquered Gaul. Caesar and his hard-hitting legions cannot be everywhere and will not triumph without powerful allies among local tribes. But each Gallic confederation has its own agenda and must keep its eyes not only on the Romans but also on Celtic, Belgic, and Germanic rivals. Players recruit forces, rally allies, husband resources for war, and balance dispersed action with the effectiveness and risk of concentrated battle.&#10;&#10;Leveraging GMT's popular COIN Series system to integrate historical events with wide-ranging strategic options across the game board, Falling Sky provides accessible and deep historical gaming of war, politics, and diplomacy.

While the players try to optimally develop their own Colonia, they should not fail in supporting the Emperor's building project to the best of their abilities at the same time.

263	156776	Warhammer 40,000: Conquest	In Warhammer 40,000: Conquest, a two-player Living Card Game, you take the part of a warlord, leading your armies into battle against your opponent in a bid to claim glorious victory. Even as you lead your bravest warriors into battle, you must plan for the future, establishing a presence on planets before the tides of war consume them in blood and fire. You must conquer the Traxis sector by strength of arms for in the grim darkness of the far future, there is only war.&#10;&#10;Warhammer 40,000: Conquest introduces seven distinct factions: Space Marines, Astra Militarum, Orks, Chaos, Dark Eldar, Eldar, and Tau. Each of these factions possesses a unique flavor and style of play, and an alignment wheel introduces the possibility of forming an alliance between two factions.&#10;&#10;At the start of play, the Traxis sector lies open before you, with planets awaiting the tramp of armies on the road to war. Each round begins with you and your opponent preparing for battle. Planet cards are arranged in a row between the players at the beginning of the game, and the planet farthest to the left of the starting player is the first planet. Each round, you or your opponent will clash at the first planet, and the victor will capture the first planet.&#10;&#10;Capturing planets is your ultimate goal. Some planets possess essential materials necessary for the armies of the 41st millennium. Others offer strategic advantages to those who hold them, while yet others are home to great technological wealth. Each of the planet cards possesses one or more symbols in the upper left hand corner, designating that planet's assets. These symbols grant no abilities by themselves, but the first player to collect three planets sharing a common symbol dominates the sector and wins the game.&#10;&#10;Your warlord grants powerful special abilities, determines your starting resources and hand size, and serves as a vital part of your army, so you'll want to build your deck around your warlord to take full advantage of his strengths &mdash; and cover his weaknesses, as defeating the opponent's warlord is another way to victory.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	2	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/7u9y7JnR91pkt__MjrU6EA__original/img/gTqjQ8iLbPbjtLbGJHAu_HjoiF4=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2079275.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/7u9y7JnR91pkt__MjrU6EA__thumb/img/QdrvsZBLNHohQ_rIra14zlmBJ3Q=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2079275.jpg
264	40793	Dice Town	Each player gets a cup with five poker dice and eight dollars. Each turn, a player will put together a poker hand and depending on the roll, take control of various key places in Dice Town that will allow him to perform the corresponding action of the location.&#10;&#10;In a turn, all players shake their cup and take out all but one die, which is kept apart from the others. They repeat the process with the remaining dice until all five dice are on the table. Players may want to keep more than one die; they pay one dollar for each additional die.&#10;&#10;Now the locations are checked...&#10;&#10;Nines: In the gold mine, the player with the most 9's may take one nugget from the mine for each nine he has thrown.&#10;&#10;Tens: In the bank, the player with the most 10's may rob the bank and take all bills there - each two bills represent one victory point at game end.&#10;&#10;Jacks: The player who has the most J's goes to the general store and draws as many cards as he had thrown J's, keeping one. These cards may give from one to eight points, or entitle a player to perform the saloon or general store action twice in a row, place a die with a result of a player's choice under the cup without rolling, or steal 4 dollars from another player. There are many more cards of this kind that spice up the game.&#10;&#10;Queens: The player with the most Q's in his roll wins the favor of the girls, and takes advantage of their charm to steal from an opponent. He may take as many cards from his opponent as he has thrown Q's, keeping one and giving back the others.&#10;&#10;Kings: The player with the most K's becomes the new sheriff; he decides who wins in any ties, but the sheriff can be influenced with nuggets, cards, or money.&#10;&#10;Aces/Poker hand: In the town hall, the player with the best poker hand gets a property claim worth from one to five victory points. Having aces in the best poker hand permits taking additional cards.&#10;&#10;Finally, if a player did not win anything during a turn, he might visit Doc Badluck where he can choose any one of the following:&#10;- equip oneself with barbed wire - the player has two property claims that cannot be stolen;&#10;- draw the first card from the general store pile;&#10;- all other players must give the player two dollars;&#10;- an ace will bring a nugget from every other player.&#10;&#10;The game ends when there are no more gold nuggets in the mine or when all property claims have been issued. Players count their points: 1 for each nugget, 1 for every two dollars, 5 for whomever is currently sheriff, and each general store and property card for its value.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	5	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/l49r5hKd5hmevQQ0t17Yiw__original/img/rJZeoSIUEvhLTF-WtUF4p9PYTHI=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3763073.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/l49r5hKd5hmevQQ0t17Yiw__thumb/img/-WfbpNcDeucmvZP4JkMKcap-wvY=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3763073.jpg
265	207691	Railroad Revolution	Ambition and a thirst for wealth have driven humanity to strive for ever greater progress. In America, during the 19th century, battles were waged between huge railway corporations that sought to connect state to state and coast with coast&hellip; making themselves filthy rich in the process. Railroad Revolution drops you straight into the middle of these tempestuous years; a time that changed America forever.&#10;&#10;In Railroad Revolution, you will manage your own railroad company, ruthlessly competing to be the most powerful railroad tycoon across all America. You will build railroads, establish stations in your connected cities, expand the network of telegraph lines, and chase your objectives, increasing the value of your company with every action you take.&#10;&#10;You start with mainly a team of non-specialized workers, but during the game you can hire additional ones with specific skill sets. The cost or effect of an action is determined by the type of worker that does it. To complete your company objectives, you will have to remove some of your workers from your active pool, promoting them to managerial positions. You must carefully assign each of your workers to perform the right action at the right time in order to exploit their specializations in the best way. You need to decide which ones to promote and which are instead still needed to take actions, as your priorities will change from turn to turn.&#10;&#10;Railroad Revolution is a fast paced game with relatively simple rules, and it provides you with interesting and challenging decisions. Having a good strategy and finding the correct timing to implement it, is the key to winning the game.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/0A9aGzLzmBxN_M6rgpb6Dg__original/img/HEY1bQT6vQvTpcfVieS0P7wSRJU=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3200781.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/0A9aGzLzmBxN_M6rgpb6Dg__thumb/img/pupJXts3kO3x05Ki-lhREAPWrhw=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3200781.jpg

On a turn, you either draw two transportation cards from the deck or the display of five face-up cards (or you take one face-up taxi, which counts as all six colors in the game); or you claim a route on the board by discarding cards that match the color of the route being claimed (with any set of cards allowing you to claim a gray route); or you draw two destination tickets and keep at least one of them.&#10;&#10;Players take turns until someone has no more than two taxis in their supply, then each player takes one final turn, including the player who triggered the end of the game. Players then sum their points, scoring points for the routes that they've claimed during the game, the destination tickets that they've completed (by connecting the two locations on a ticket by a continuous line of their taxis), and the tourist attractions that they've reached with their taxis. You lose points for any uncompleted destination tickets, then whoever has the high score wins!&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/v0YHI6x4g8dJdtSqaxMdiA__original/img/U0g-dhZFasfDloAJDxP1NT5ruDI=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4132194.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/v0YHI6x4g8dJdtSqaxMdiA__thumb/img/wqM16CzK9QcarS8s6X6iAxvFe3Q=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4132194.jpg

Players want to fill their tombs with food, canopic jars, statues, amulets and other treasures, and to do so they acquire cards that are laid out in the shape of a pyramid; purchase cards at the base of the pyramid, and it &quot;crumbles&quot; to bring cards higher in the pyramid to the base where they can be bought.  The pyramid resets each round with new offerings.&#10;&#10;You score only for cards that you remove from your deck and stash in your tomb, so if you keep using valuable cards for their effects and don't entomb them before the game ends, you could lose out on big points!

269	75449	Firenze	In the Florence of the 12th-14th centuries, the city's powerful and influential families don't just compete with each other in trade and politics. They also try to outdo one another by building tall, mostly square-based tower homes as status symbols.&#10;&#10;In Firenze, you are master builders working on the families' construction commissions for such towers. Each player competes to earn the most prestige points by completing the commissions from families and the church and by placing their seals on the work they have done. When someone plays their final seal, the other builders get one more turn before the final scoring.&#10;&#10;Colored bricks are the currency of the game, and cards can both help and hinder your progress. On a turn, a player must choose a card from the display, taking the bricks from it and paying a brick to every card skipped. There is an opportunity to exchange three bricks for one on display before the player works in their construction site. Players can have multiple towers under construction at once. However, for every brick they wish to add on a turn, there is an extra cost, and if any towers are not built upon during a turn, then they are torn down as abandoned construction. Players must pay attention to other projects so that commissions they were counting on are not snatched away before they can claim them.&#10;&#10;This game won the second prize at the &quot;Hippodice e.V.

290	153065	Linko	In Linko! (a.k.a. Abluxxen), you take turns playing number cards, and the more cards of the same number you play, the better as cards score points at the end of the game. If someone else plays the same amount of cards with a higher number, however, your cards get nicked! Stealing cards can be good, but if you can't use them later, and end the game with cards in hand, they'll cost you points.&#10;&#10;In more detail, the deck contains 104 number cards (1-13 x8) and five joker cards. Each player starts with a hand of 13 cards, and six cards are laid face-up next to the deck. On a turn, a player lays down one or more cards of the same value, adding jokers if desired; if she already has cards on the table, she lays these cards so that previously played cards are still visible. If any opponent has most recently played the same number of cards and those cards are of a lower value, then the active player &quot;abluxxes&quot; those opponents &mdash; that is, the active player can take the abluxxed cards into her hand and the opponent then draws the same number of cards, either from the display or the deck; if she doesn't take these cards in hand, then the opponent either returns these cards to his hand or discards them and draws that many cards. Refill the display only after someone finishes drawing cards. (Jokers can be played on their own, and they are considered to be higher than all values.)&#10;&#10;As soon as the deck runs out of cards or a player has no cards in hand, the game ends immediately, even if the player would normally abluxx an opponent. Each player scores one point for each card on the table in front of him, then loses one point for each card in hand. Whoever has the highest score wins. If players wish, they can play multiple rounds and sum their scores over the rounds to determine a winner.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	5	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/93dmjdpiUd5J3Vf95uF0HQ__original/img/4Bf2Yn4Zejbv_NFHJ1X9IWldeI0=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic7634588.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/93dmjdpiUd5J3Vf95uF0HQ__thumb/img/4yLeQ5CsTpK8imlGb9WedgAvVeM=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7634588.jpg

They will need to transport their crew among the newly discovered islands to capture livestock, construct outposts and fulfill various other goals. So ready the longships, there are new horizons to explore!&#10;&#10;&#10;Gameplay Overview&#10;Each player starts with 7 Vikings and a Longboat on a shared, central Island. From there players will place tiles and begin to venture out to the newly discovered Islands.&#10;Proceeding clockwise from the starting player, each player takes their turn in full. On their turn, players first place 1 of their 3 tiles, expanding the game board. They can then take up to 4 actions (any number of the following):&#10;&#10;1. Load Longship&#10;2. Unload Longship + Deliver Livestock&#10;3. Move Longship + Destroy an Enemy Ship&#10;4. Move Vikings + Raid a Settlement&#10;5. Transport Livestock&#10;6.

This should be exactly 48 turns (there are 48 Tiles). Victory Points are gained from:&#10;&#10;1. Delivered Livestock&#10;2. Constructed Outposts&#10;3. Destroyed Enemy Ships&#10;4.

275	823	The Lord of the Rings	The Lord of the Rings is a co-operative game in which the object is to destroy the Ring while surviving the corrupting influence of Sauron. Each player plays one of the Hobbits in the fellowship, each of which has a unique power.&#10;&#10;Over the course of the game, you make your way across four conflict game boards, representing some of the most memorable conflicts from the entire trilogy: Moria, Helm's Deep, Shelob's Lair, and Mordor. Each conflict board tests your small Fellowship to the utmost as you must play your quest cards to advance along multiple tracks. These tracks represent fighting, hiding, traveling, and friendship, and by playing quest cards from your hand with matching symbols, you can keep moving forward and push closer to victory.&#10;&#10;The master game board indicates both the physical progress of the fellowship across Middle Earth and the corrupting influence of Sauron on the hobbits. If you're able to slip past your foes, you can hope to escape with minimal corruption, healing your hurts at safe havens along your path, such as the forest kingdom of Lothl&oacute;rien. By playing your cards right and advancing quickly, you can collect powerful runes, unlock legendary cards to aid your journey, or find life tokens to help stave off corruption &mdash; not to mention advancing quickly through the conflicts. As you travel, the One Ring can be a crucial tool in your journey, allowing you to hide from sight, but repeated use will draw the attention of Sauron and corrupt the heart of the Ring-bearer.&#10;&#10;Your journey leads you deeper into the darkness with each passing conflict, and safe havens become few and far between. You must carefully watch the corruption track because if the Sauron miniature ever meets a Hobbit, that player is eliminated &mdash; and if the Ring-bearer is eliminated, all players lose as Sauron reclaims the power of the One Ring. To win, throw the One Ring into the volcanic fires of Mount Doom.&#10;&#10;This game should not be confused with Reiner Knizia's children's game (Lord of the Rings) with the same title, or with his very different two-player Lord of the Rings: The Confrontation.&#10;&#10;Lord of the Rings - Limited Edition&#10;&#10;A special edition limited to 500 copies in the English language and 250 in German published by Sophisticated Games and Kosmos in November 2001.

276	157809	Nations: The Dice Game	From the humble beginnings of civilization through the historical ages of progress, mankind has lived, fought and built together in nations. Great nations protect and provide for their own, while fighting and competing against both other nations and nature itself. Nations must provide food as the population increases, build a productive economy, and amaze the world with their great achievements to build up their heritage as the greatest nations in the history of mankind!&#10;&#10;Nations: The Dice Game is a game for 1-4 players that takes 10-15 minutes per player and shares many concepts with the civilization-building game Nations while still offering its own challenges. The game is played over four ages (four rounds). During each round, players take turns until all have passed. The available actions are:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Buy a tile&#10;     Build a wonder&#10;     Reroll some or all your dice&#10;&#10;&#10;Buildings and military provide dice. Colonies and wonders provide resources and victory points. Advisors provide rerolls. New tiles provide benefits immediately, so you can roll new dice at once.&#10;&#10;At the end of each round, War and Famine drawn at the start of the round is checked for each player, giving you victory points if you match or beat the values. Books are accumulated and scored. Player order is checked, with high military strength going first in the next round. At the end of the game, whoever has the most victory points wins.&#10;&#10;	\N	1	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/cAUrzJCm1nNzJ_JyH6N85g__original/img/OJ_xr9s3GeMwG4s4rqp7xJrEgpA=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3743789.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/cAUrzJCm1nNzJ_JyH6N85g__thumb/img/mB-g90DCrvuRHH2V8ErYeYwF6p0=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3743789.jpg

The winner will be the Empire with more population and prestige at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;With a growing empire, feeding your people is the main goal. Wheat was scarce in Greece, so both players must secure other goods supply and the route to five markets in order to trade them for wheat. Each territory may give you different amount of wood, metal, wine, olive oil, silver and some wheat; these two last ones are hard to get but precious. It&rsquo;s up to you if you want to get more of only one good or less from several of them. Every turn you get goods from a territory you must have some population there (supporting your Empire) but in the end they also have to be fed.&#10;&#10;Fighting for the control of the territories and the sieges of the polis will be the job of your hoplites, your triremes will struggle to secure the routes to Egypt, Persia...so you can trade with them when the price is low, and a good use of your Diplomatic may convince a Polis to join your League easily.&#10;&#10;A Polis may be your ally, but they are very proud of their independence, so you will have to create some Projects (statues, temples, artists, philosophers, games...) in order to gain Prestige which is needed for all your military manoeuvres.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	2	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/9O_e79sEzNqpd6R-442d-w__original/img/Ea37T1CWiOjPx5Vv5e-4m90DP84=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1032795.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/9O_e79sEzNqpd6R-442d-w__thumb/img/nwyG0AnwDYpQtbDZJSzqutsBGyM=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1032795.jpg

After shuffling the deck of cards, draw and reveal the first card. Each player takes a number tile matching the card and places it on the table. With each new card drawn after that, each player takes the appropriate number tile, then adds it to the tiles that they already have in play, with each player building their own arrangement of tiles.&#10;&#10;The new tile must touch at least one other tile on the same level along one side of a square. A tile can also be placed on top of two or more other tiles as long as no part of the new tile overhangs the tiles below it; new tiles placed on this same level must touch at least one other tile, while also covering parts of at least two tiles and not overhanging.&#10;&#10;Once all the cards have been drawn and the tiles placed, players take turns calculating their score. A tile on the bottom level &mdash; the 0th level, if you will &mdash; scores 0 points; a tile on the 1st level above this is worth as many points as the number on the tile; a tile on the 2nd level is worth twice the number on the tile; etc. Whoever scores the most points wins!&#10;&#10;	\N	1	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/a6j6yZmBJ5J2hcuo0KOW-A__original/img/PtqzpYyf8ENzK589ZVNifR62V3Y=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3328269.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/a6j6yZmBJ5J2hcuo0KOW-A__thumb/img/w62iXqdK9cU_QCAwJffXewexjaU=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3328269.jpg

With nothing else to compete for, the bored populace has turned to the Super Brawl for entertainment. These same powerful magics are now used to reach back into the timelines to pluck out the finest warriors from every civilization in order to compete against each other in the greatest entertainment spectacle ever staged.&#10;&#10;Super Fantasy Brawl is a fun, fast-paced competitive miniatures board game.

A mysterious burst in the sky gave ordinary men and women extraordinary powers. They're called Epics. But, every Epic turned out to be evil. Today, in the city once known as Chicago (now Newcago), an all-powerful Epic named Steelheart reigns supreme!&#10;&#10;Nobody fights back... nobody but the Reckoners! This is where you come in. You are a member of the Reckoners, a skilled group of normal humans who assassinate Epics. Your mission is simple, but not easy.

Throughout the game, you will work with your fellow Reckoners to research and attack Steelheart, but he is not alone. Numerous Epics are scattered throughout the city, and they will wreak havoc upon the population, if left unchecked. If the Epics manage to destroy Newcago by reducing the population to 0, then all Reckoners lose.&#10;&#10;The Reckoners determine which actions to take primarily through a simultaneous, dice rolling mechanism, where each player can keep and reroll results up to three times at their own pace. Equipment Cards and Plan Tokens will also allow you to gain extra actions or improve/manipulate the results of your dice. Actions are resolved simultaneously as well, so communication and collaborative planning are key to ensuring optimal outcomes.&#10;&#10;Your dice can be used to attack Epics, research Epics, contain Epics, attack Enforcement, earn money, acquire Plan Tokens, move around the game board, remove barricades, and activate special equipment powers. Researching and Attacking Epics will help you earn valuable rewards, including clues about Steelheart's weakness. But, there will always be more Epics than you, so you have to choose your battles wisely. When all actions have been taken by The Reckoners, then it's the Epics turn.&#10;&#10;Each round, all of the Epics are going to activate, performing an array of actions and then powering up to be even more devastating next round. Each Epic also has a unique set of actions it performs, so you're always facing multiple threats that function very differently. The crux of the game is deciding how to resolve these competing threats and prioritize your actions together to eliminate Epics and ultimately win the game. How, when, and where you act will determine your victory or failure.&#10;&#10;Summary:&#10;In short, The Reckoners plays like a challenging, ever-shifting puzzle. If you like co-operative games where you carefully manage resources, build powerful action combos, create tactical plans with your teammates, and work together to take down the bad guy while on the brink of defeat, then be sure to check out The Reckoners.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;	\N	1	6	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/pErtwXL-jxcz_l7akqACmg__original/img/jnXGhPo2KV4cbL1yGsbzIJtTrYk=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3584095.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/pErtwXL-jxcz_l7akqACmg__thumb/img/ixsm739pmLZwGaqksGykCp-pkXI=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3584095.jpg
291	306481	Tawantinsuyu: The Inca Empire	The great Sapa Inca Pachacuti turned to his offspring and ordered them to worship Inti, the Sun God, and to expand the Inca Empire as far as the llamas roam. With Chinchaysuyu, Antisuyu, Qullasuyu, and Kuntisuyu &mdash; the four regions of the new empire &mdash; now ripe for conquest, the time has come for Pachacuti's true successor to arise.&#10;&#10;Gather your people from the villages below and use their unique abilities to strategically place them where they can perform the greatest tasks for you. Climb the steps of the Sun Temple, reaping the rewards of your piety. Build structures that both nourish your people and provide you with benefits no other has at their disposal. Muster an army and conquer villages in the four realms of Tawantinsuyu. Prove yourself a worthy successor to Pachacuti and lead the Inca to glory!&#10;&#10;During Tawantinsuyu: The Inca Empire, players place workers onto various locations on the game board, performing actions, collecting resources (potatoes, corn, stone, and gold), constructing buildings and stairs, sculpt statues, expanding their military strength, and collecting weavings.&#10;&#10;The game board features a hill located within the old Inca capital of Cusco, the sides of which are terraced and divided into five sections. Atop the hill sits the Coricancha, The Golden Temple, the most important temple of the Inca Empire. Within the Coricancha, each player has a High Priest. On the terraced sections below exist a variety of worker placement locations, interconnected by paths and individually marked by symbols. On your turn, you must either place a worker onto a location outside the Coricancha OR choose two of the following:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Recruit one worker.&#10;     Take two god cards.&#10;     Draw two army cards and keep one of them.&#10;     Move your High Priest one or two steps clockwise within the Coricancha.&#10;&#10;&#10;When placing a worker, you must first discard a god card with a matching symbol or pay one gold. Once placed, the worker remains on the game board for the rest of the game! Each worker placement location is connected to exactly three action spaces. You must always perform at least one of these actions. However, for each adjacent worker (i.e., connected to your worker's location via direct path through one of the action spaces) that matches the type of worker just placed, you receive one additional action!&#10;&#10;While some locations will result in you being able to perform multiple actions, other actions and placements may be more desirable, especially since each of the five types of workers has a unique ability:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Warrior: Remove one of the adjacent workers, placing it in your player area.&#10;     Craftsman: Gain +1 action if placed onto a craftsman space.&#10;     Architect: Gain +1 action if placed onto an architect space.&#10;     Courier: Decreased placement cost; +1 action if it's the first worker placed within a given area.&#10;     Priest: Take one god card; you may pay one potato to gain +1 action.&#10;&#10;&#10;All god cards feature one of the different symbols found on the worker placement locations. Before placing a worker, you must either discard a god card with a matching symbol or pay valuable gold resources. God cards also depict special abilities that can be activated only if you have previously built a matching statue!&#10;&#10;Army cards allow you to send one or more units to conquer villages in nearby regions. You must compete against the other players for control of each region as well as for valuable rewards that can be gained as a result of military conquest.&#10;&#10;The position of your High Priest within the Coricancha has a significant impact on your overall strategy, affecting your access to powerful actions and determining any potential resource costs when placing your workers. More specifically, when placing a worker, you must pay additional resources the farther your worker is from your High Priest, from nothing all the way up to eight potatoes or corn!&#10;&#10;Additionally, when moving your High Priest, you can activate powerful actions available only within the Coricancha:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Produce: Gain all rewards from your production buildings.&#10;     Worship: Sacrifice previously sculpted statues to gain permanent temple advancements.&#10;     Offering: Pay resources to gain temple advancements.&#10;     Conquer: Engage in military conquest of nearby villages.&#10;     Rejuvenate: Refresh previously activated buildings and military units.&#10;&#10;&#10;Throughout the game, you score victory points whenever you construct stairs or sculpt statues. Gain bonus victory points whenever another player makes use of the stairs you have constructed. Score victory points from temple advancements and control of the four regions.&#10;&#10;The game ends when the worker pool has become exhausted, symbolizing the full incorporation of nearby regions and villages into the newly risen Inca Empire. You then score bonus victory points from reaching the top of the temple, from your woven tapestries, and from various buildings and resources you have accumulated.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from publisher&#10;&#10;	\N	1	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/pxqUJZDKEyHAY0Ex5zk66A__original/img/DxhdgQiNz_n8zlg3nuv5nYJhr40=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5325153.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/pxqUJZDKEyHAY0Ex5zk66A__thumb/img/Vr0kZZ70HW9N-wOBVoEGMks3d6w=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5325153.jpg
739	355093	Woodcraft	In Woodcraft, you play as forest people running competing workshops in the woods, with you gathering wood and crafting goods for your customers. Along the way, you hire helpers, improve your workshop, and buy different types of wood and other tools to create the best workshop you can.&#10;&#10;During the game, players complete their projects with wood (dice) that can be cut down to size, glued back together, and adjusted using dice manipulation to be as efficient as possible with their resources.&#10;&#10;Whoever builds the best, most successful workshop wins.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;	\N	1	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/S1_USNVBwzwidSpxAoKhuw__original/img/v6Siq5_xrd8ONpw_jrcWCLPjVSI=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic6940296.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/S1_USNVBwzwidSpxAoKhuw__thumb/img/26QtSRyUNOySkhtk6tnkzVqPx5A=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6940296.jpg

283	131646	Merchant of Venus (Second Edition)	Merchant of Venus uses many elements that come together to form a very interesting game. Players take on the roles of space traders who move their ships through interconnected systems discovering new alien worlds to trade with. As players start to make money delivering commodities in a unique supply-and-demand system, their earnings can be used to purchase better ships and equipment (shields, lasers, engines, etc...) and construct their own spaceports (which speed up trading) and factories (which create better commodities). Variations included in the rulebook allow for interplayer combat. The player who first acquires enough total value ($1000, $2000, $3000, $4000) in cash and port/factory deeds takes the day.&#10;&#10;For the 2012 edition of Merchant of Venus from Fantasy Flight Games, the company promises that this revision &quot;remains true to its magnificently campy core while updating the map and game components and expanding game play in surprising ways that will cause even the most hardcore fan to celebrate.&quot; That said, the player count has been lowered from six (in the Avalon Hill edition) to four, with the four races in the game being Human, Whynom, Qossuth, and Eeepeeep.&#10;&#10;	\N	1	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/2aHxs1ljNAD2Q2e8q6vW2w__original/img/Rf75ATYGTpO-54sPSj4X3XhLI70=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1134632.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/2aHxs1ljNAD2Q2e8q6vW2w__thumb/img/_XGWw_z41Vp3M5Ycn2YXmqK53SE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1134632.jpg
284	207243	The City of Kings	This world used to be a garden full of life; from the flying Vadora to the deep-dwelling Dwarves &ndash; but that was before Vesh came. The world has been lost and only one city remains; the oldest city in the world &ndash; and the last refuge for all of us. Now... we fight back.&#10;&#10;The City of Kings is a co-operative, puzzle-based, fantasy adventure board game for 1 - 4 players in which your character is tasked with exploring the hazardous world, trading for vital resources, and battling your enemies whilst uncovering a story of a world imperiled.&#10;&#10;You start by choosing one of seven stories or twelve scenarios, then select your hero, with each of the six heroes featuring twelve unique skills and nine customizable stats that allow you to specialize in attacking, healing, tanking, worker management, or whatever you desire. Aside from your hero, you need to manage your workers, who must gather resources in order to trade for new items and build structures to gain powerful bonuses.&#10;&#10;You explore across the Ageless Realms by turning over tiles, discovering resources, side quests, hazards, building sites, traders and creatures as you continue to power up whilst preparing to enter Azure Rise.&#10;&#10;At its heart, The City of Kings is a complex puzzle featuring endless strategic battles. Each creature is generated from a pool of spells, characteristics and stats offering over 10,000,000 unique battle situations. There are no dice, damage is persistent, it&rsquo;s up to you to customize your characters and work together to come up with a strategy to defeat whoever stands in your way.&#10;&#10;	\N	1	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/uHWXusF0SPY6jWbKNSa-DQ__original/img/0-O0KWKywJGhYQS6VqLvFCiZkc8=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic3407111.png	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/uHWXusF0SPY6jWbKNSa-DQ__thumb/img/six2Xwh3YniHHk3nTnZLCJvGGtw=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3407111.png
285	35497	Fauna	360 animals on big cards are waiting for the players of Fauna. Every round a single animal presents itself by name and picture. The 2-6 players try to guess the animal's weight, length, height, tail length and - most important - the areas in which the animal lives on the Earth. The early bird gets the worm: an area on the big map or a sector on the scales already occupied by a player token cannot be chosen a second time. When no player wants to set another token the round ends and the scoring is performed. Tokens on correct spaces get points for the corresponding player, also tokens in the direct neighborhood of correct spaces score points. Tokens not earning points are temporarily out of the game - so risk should be carefully considered. Next round - next animal - starting player changes. The first player who reaches a certain total score wins (normally after 8-12 animals).&#10;&#10;	\N	2	6	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/0H16R7djqxCy6S9p7TCvNQ__original/img/DpSKZ5CCmLkZkkdrH9Hn19P-yl4=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1091049.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/0H16R7djqxCy6S9p7TCvNQ__thumb/img/UB6Qwid9D12Vytb33HytQZH8Blo=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1091049.jpg
292	309630	Small World of Warcraft	In Small World of Warcraft, players vie for conquest and control of a world that is simply too small to accommodate everybody.&#10;&#10;Small World of Warcraft is set on the fantasy world of Azeroth, where the races of the Alliance and the Horde &mdash; including Orcs, Dwarves, Trolls, and Worgen &mdash; clash in a world-consuming conflict. In the game, players choose combinations of special powers and races from the Warcraft universe, such as Portal Mage Pandarens or Herbalist Goblins, and vie for control of Azeroth. To help them achieve dominance, players will occupy legendary terrains and seek control of powerful artifacts. However, all empires must eventually fall, so players need to be ready to put an overextended race into a state of &quot;decline&quot; and lead a new one to rule Azeroth.&#10;&#10;In more detail, on each turn either you use the multiple tiles of your chosen fantasy race to (normally) occupy adjacent territories, possibly defeating weaker enemy races along the way, or you give up on your race and let it go into decline. A race in decline is designated by flipping the tiles over to their black-and-white side. At the start of the game or after you go into decline, you choose a new race/power combination at the start of your turn, with the 16 races and 20 powers being paired randomly each game.&#10;&#10;At the end of your turn, you score one coin for each territory your races occupy. You may have one active race and one race in decline on the board at the same time. Your occupation total can vary depending on the special abilities of your race and the territories they occupy. After the final round, the player with the most coins wins.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	5	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/KVLeGFlhzRVDHILRABi-Vg__original/img/bxdc4acrih9phJ951CswF5-aCHg=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic5643225.png	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/KVLeGFlhzRVDHILRABi-Vg__thumb/img/bn16cR_XTwbrR6y4OEK3CZBGXD8=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5643225.png
286	127518	A Distant Plain	This volume in Volko Ruhnke's COIN Series takes 1 to 4 players into the Afghan conflict of today&rsquo;s headlines, this time in a unique collaboration between two top designers of boardgames on modern irregular warfare.  A Distant Plain teams Volko Ruhnke, the award-winning designer of Labyrinth: The War on Terror, with Brian Train, a designer with 20 years' experience creating influential simulations such as Algeria, Somalia Interventions, Shining Path: The Struggle for Peru, and many others.&#10;&#10;A Distant Plain features the same accessible game system as GMT's recent Andean Abyss and upcoming Cuba Libre but with new factions, capabilities, events, and objectives.  For the first time in the Series, two counterinsurgent (COIN) factions must reconcile competing visions for Afghanistan in order to coordinate a campaign against a dangerous twin insurgency.&#10;&#10;A Distant Plain adapts familiar Andean Abyss mechanics to the conditions of Afghanistan without adding rules complexity.  A snap for Series: COIN (GMT) players to learn, A Distant Plain will transport them to a different place and time.  New features include:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Coalition-Government joint operations.&#10;     Volatile Pakistani posture toward the conflict.&#10;     Evolution of both COIN and insurgent tactics and technology.&#10;     Government graft and desertion.&#10;     Coalition casualties.&#10;     Returning Afghan refugees.&#10;     Pashtun ethnic terrain.&#10;     Multiple scenarios.&#10;     A deck of 72 fresh events.&#10;&#10;&#10;... and more.&#10;&#10;As with each COIN Series volume, players of A Distant Plain will face difficult strategic decisions with each card.  The innovative game system smoothly integrates political, cultural, and economic affairs with military and other violent and non-violent operations and capabilities.  Flow charts are at hand to run the three Afghan factions, so that any number of players&mdash;from solitaire to 4&mdash;can experience the internecine brawl that is today's Afghanistan.&#10;&#10;	\N	1	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/-PI0iVHeKyFfjYST0xi9dQ__original/img/SofoqBXs6Ns_1IeqQ-XvpKkYJV4=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1733403.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/-PI0iVHeKyFfjYST0xi9dQ__thumb/img/k3pBQFl0qxKOEREh-jeJBEvaVmc=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1733403.jpg
287	146312	Ghost Fightin' Treasure Hunters	In a dark and dreary house, every sound sends a cold chill through your bones. A door opens &ndash; is someone there? You hear whispers, but no one answers when you call. Your eyes and ears may deceive you, but the hair on your neck tells you what you already know: There are ghosts here &mdash; and not just one for these spirits are legion.&#10;&#10;In Ghost Fightin' Treasure Hunters, a.k.a. Geister, Geister, Schatzsuchmeister!, four intrepid treasure hunters are on a quest, searching for precious hidden jewels, but the phantoms  in this house do not give up their bounty easily. As their ghoulish numbers grow, the treasure hunters must work together to acquire all eight jewels and escape the house before it becomes fully haunted or else face their own gruesome demise.&#10;&#10;Players roll dice to determine how many spaces they move this turn and whether a new ghost is added to the board. Players may move up  to the number of spaces shown on the die. If they end their movement in a space with a treasure, they may pick it up and place it in their backpack. If they end their movement in a space with a ghost, they fight that ghost by rolling a fight die. If they roll the matching symbol, they remove the ghost from the game board.&#10;&#10;If the players must add a third ghost to a room, it transforms into a haunting. A haunting requires at least two people in the room to attempt a fight with it. Players win if they can get all eight treasures and their whole team out of the house; they lose if all six hauntings are on the board.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/2IQdeGbxKaS0LxllRQal4w__original/img/lNxubEdIZg5DWyLIxBNOIBaaMP4=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3518338.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/2IQdeGbxKaS0LxllRQal4w__thumb/img/YxLV6k2BCT9f2mIRliseLiPlZ3s=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3518338.jpg
288	245476	CuBirds	Every day, dozens of birds have a stop on the fences of our countryside. When it is time to leave, all these birds mix together, unable to organize themselves into flocks to fly home. Help them find their way back to their nest.&#10;&#10;Players begin each new round of CuBirds with eight bird cards in hand. Some birds also sit on four distinct fences on the table. On your turn, you lay a series of identical birds from your hand on one fence's extremity. These birds instantly gather with any identical bird already present on this fence, making all birds placed in-between them fly into your hand. With enough identical birds in your hand, you can perform a flock, allowing you to add some of these birds in your scoring area.&#10;&#10;Your ultimate goal is to be the first player to gather in your scoring area either seven different species, or two species with at least three identical birds in each. Each bird comes with one small and one big flock scores, so you may want to wait to reach a big flock to add more birds at once to your scoring area. Beware, though, as the round ends as soon as a player empties their hand, forcing all players to discard their current hands and plans!&#10;&#10;	\N	2	5	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/FDBUwGFBkniyl8q4Alvq8A__original/img/PQee1I5tS1r2TjNXMj7XR6uCsxE=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic7491534.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/FDBUwGFBkniyl8q4Alvq8A__thumb/img/EiGltQvI5VsmCSYYxjgD7kXY2eg=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7491534.jpg

294	191231	Via Nebula	Crafters, builders and carriers &mdash; your help is needed to dispel the mists of Nebula! The people of the valley will reward you handsomely if you harvest and exploit our many resources, open paths through the mists, and help our settlers build new structures. Cooperate temporarily with other builders in order to create paths and share goods, but do not forget your own objectives. Will you have a statue erected in your honor on the Nebula City plaza?&#10;&#10;A game of Via Nebula starts with a board showing a hexagonal grid, some production sites with a few available resources on them (wood, stone, wheat, and pigs), building sites in various areas scattered over the whole board, and a lot of mist.&#10;&#10;Turn after turn, players have two actions at their disposal from these options: They may clear the mist of a hex to create new paths of transportation, open new production sites, open a building site in a city, carry resources from any production site to their own building sites, and, of course, achieve a construction. Resources and paths through the mist may be used by all the players. This initially induces a kind of cooperation, but eventually other players will take advantage of your actions!&#10;&#10;To achieve a construction, you fulfill a contract on one of your cards. You start the game with two contracts, and four more contracts are available for all players to see and use on a first come, first served basis &mdash; and that's where the cooperation abruptly stops. Additionally, most contracts have special powers that are triggered on completion.&#10;&#10;The game ends when a player finishes a fifth building. Opponents each take two final actions, then players score based on the number of cleared hexes and opened production sites and the point value of their contracts, with a bonus for the player who ended the game.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/fBgqTXGvFnr4mzdJo3CJvw__original/img/-dyC6qxjFUYJYapJzAA20yeteAg=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic2839651.png	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/fBgqTXGvFnr4mzdJo3CJvw__thumb/img/wkmN5b3_P3RXe7z095TsOeEt-6U=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2839651.png
295	334590	For Northwood! A Solo Trick-Taking Game	For Northwood! Is a solo hand management and precision trick-taking game. Your objective is to peacefully unify the kingdom of Northwood through conversations with their rulers.  Over eight rounds, you must visit eight animal fiefs and engage their rulers in dialogue (tricks). Each ruler's suit represents the trump for that fief. Each ruler also requires you to win an exact number of tricks to join your alliance, so the game gets harder as your options dwindle.&#10;&#10;You start with four allies, each with an ability that you can use once per visit.

296	72225	CO₂	In the 1970s, the governments of the world faced unprecedented demand for energy, and polluting power plants were built everywhere in order to meet that demand. Year after year, the pollution they generate increases, and nobody has done anything to reduce it. Now, the impact of this pollution has become too great, and humanity is starting to realize that we must meet our energy demands through clean sources of energy. Companies with expertise in clean, sustainable energy are called in to propose projects that will provide the required energy without polluting the environment. Regional governments are eager to fund these projects, and to invest in their implementation.&#10;&#10;If the pollution isn't stopped, it's game over for all of us.&#10;&#10;In the game CO&#226;&#130;&#130;, each player is the CEO of an energy company responding to government requests for new, green power plants. The goal is to stop the increase of pollution, while meeting the rising demand for sustainable energy &mdash; and of course profiting from doing so. You will need enough expertise, money, and resources to build these clean power plants. Energy summits will promote global awareness, and allow companies to share a little of their expertise, while learning still more from others.&#10;&#10;In CO&#226;&#130;&#130;, each region starts with a certain number of Carbon Emissions Permits (CEPs) at its disposal. These CEPs are granted by the United Nations, and they must be spent whenever the region needs to install the energy infrastructure for a project, or to construct a fossil fuel power plant. CEPs can be bought and sold on a market, and their price fluctuates throughout the game. You will want to try to maintain control over the CEPs.&#10;&#10;Money, CEPs, Green Power Plants that you've built, UN Goals you've completed, Company Goals you've met, and Expertise you've gained all give you Victory Points (VPs), which represent your Company's reputation &ndash; and having the best reputation is the goal of the game ... in addition to saving the planet, of course.&#10;&#10;	\N	1	5	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/7CdjkzPByup72oLWuOg9AA__original/img/bHBtxtjTnbKtSyUKwO50gNjSxcc=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1350204.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/7CdjkzPByup72oLWuOg9AA__thumb/img/NUltG_U1uGXWs3rwv86Om0hQgHE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1350204.jpg
297	130176	Tales & Games: The Hare & the Tortoise	The Hare &amp; the Tortoise, originally published as Royal Turtle, is a card-driven betting game about animal racing loosely based on one of Aesop's Fables.&#10;&#10;At the start of a race, each player secretly bets on up to two of five animals: turtle, rabbit, lamb, wolf and fox. One animal is chosen at random for each player, then after receiving a hand of seven cards, each player places one of his cards face-down (possibly the same animal) as an additional bet. Players then take turns laying down 1-4 cards, with all cards needing to show the same animal, then refilling the hand to five cards. As soon as eight total cards have been played or four cards of any one animal, the animals move (maybe).&#10;&#10;Each animal has a distinct characteristic that players can use to their advantage. The turtle always moves one space, but it moves two if four of its cards were played. The rabbit always moves two spaces as long as cards are played. &mdash; unless four cards are played and it's at the head of the pack, in which case it sleeps and doesn't move. The fox moves as many spaces as the number of cards played. The lamb moves one more space than the number of cards played &mdash; but if it reaches water, it stops moving to take a drink. The wolf moves 1 space if one to two cards are played, and one less space than the number of cards if more are played.  The wolf also has 3 cards with a howl, if one of these is played no one but the wolf moves.(The track consists of eleven road cards, two covered with water.)&#10;&#10;After the animals move, players start a new round of card-playing. A round ends when three of the five animals reach the goal, after which each player scores points based on the ranking of the animals and how they bet. After three rounds, the player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;The original title of Royal Turtle is a homage to Reiner Knizia's Royal Turf, another betting game about animals racing (albeit horses in that game).&#10;&#10;	\N	2	5	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/MabiuZo226P_M7PO8AJTWA__original/img/9CG7RPtceY_dUzs3XgoInPTfxZo=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2688992.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/MabiuZo226P_M7PO8AJTWA__thumb/img/WTTPtTgmU6b_glj8FGrqsEErNFI=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2688992.jpg
303	223750	Hardback	Hardback is a deck-building word game, a prequel to Paperback. As an aspiring 19th-century novelist, you work to pen your next masterpiece, earning prestige along the way.  Specialize your deck in certain genres to exploit card combinations, and press your luck to draw extra cards &mdash; but make sure you can still string a word together!&#10;&#10;Players build a deck of letters with various powers and race to 60 fame points to win.  Some of the features:&#10;&#10;&#10;    No wilds in your deck - any card can be wild.&#10;    Push your luck for more cards with the Ink system.&#10;    Match genre colors to gain bonus abilities on your cards.&#10;    New &quot;Timeless Classic&quot; letter cards stay in play until an opponent uses them.&#10;&#10;&#10;In addition to the competitive race mode for 2-5 players, the base game includes several variant rules, including Literary Awards, Adverts, Player Powers, and Events; and a co-op mode for 1-4 players, in which players join forces against one of four simulated opponents, each of which is proficient in a different deck genre.&#10;&#10;	\N	1	5	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/QKo6ujrTGJBgXoG1oEuoAQ__original/img/bPquvg26GUQ1icN94avjE3RY2PE=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3968823.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/QKo6ujrTGJBgXoG1oEuoAQ__thumb/img/owRLmPoUxcdR0JBDl5BzZ3RFLhI=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3968823.jpg
298	25568	Metropolys	Talented Urban planners and architects rival each other to construct luxury, elegant buildings of glass and steel, defying the laws of balance. Who will eventually impose their style to leave an indelible trail in the history of the city? The answer is in your hands!&#10;&#10;The players are urban planners in quest of prestige. Over the course of the game, players will try to construct their buildings in the best locations. As soon as a player has placed all of their buildings, the game ends. The player with the most prestige is the winner.&#10;&#10;Each turn a player will pick a space on the board and place one of their buildings (bidding markers) into the space, with the bidding number shown. Each following player can then either pass or raise the bid by placing a higher numbered building into an adjacent space. The eventual winner of the bid flips his building number side down and all losing bids are returned to players. A new round commences.&#10;&#10;Spaces on the board are differentiated by Metro spaces, which are worth points and reward the player with the most at game end; archaeological sites, which are worth minus points and penalize the player who most recently built on one; and fashionable locations, which are just worth extra points. In addition, each player has up to two hidden agendas that they are secretly trying to achieve, such as trying to surround water fountains or occupy both sides of bridges.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/nDR7wvOFkjReg5RGtIGpng__original/img/PZNFoTk0A7D7HMN41Ej8B_CE2ag=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic297075.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/nDR7wvOFkjReg5RGtIGpng__thumb/img/IQF7J0ktj0AN80yv70HH248Kiuo=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic297075.jpg
299	171233	The Big Book of Madness	So far your first year at the Elementary College has been slightly disappointing. They taught you to light a flickering flame at the tip of your finger, but other than that you've spent much more time reading books than learning powerful spells as future great wizards like you should.&#10;&#10;So when you heard about the Big Book of Madness hidden in the great school library, you couldn't help but to sneak in and peek in this intriguing tome in spite of your professors' warnings. When you slowly lift the cover of the terrible book, dozens of dreadful creatures rush out, threatening to destroy the world itself! This was your mistake, and only you can fix it now! Learn from the library to fight back against the monsters, and try not to sink into insanity...&#10;&#10;The Big Book of Madness is a challenging co-operative game in which the players are magic students who must act as a team to turn all the pages of the book, then shut it by defeating the terrible monsters they've just freed.&#10;&#10;Each player has their own element deck that they build during the game and use for several purposes, such as learning or casting a spell, adding a new element to their deck, destroy or healing a curse. Spells allow you to support your playmates, improve your deck, draw cards, etc. &mdash; but the monsters from the book fight back. Each comes with terrible curses that are triggered every turn unless you dispel them in time. They will make you discard elements, add madness cards to your deck, or lose spells...&#10;&#10;If you manage to turn six pages and defeat all of the monsters, you win the game!&#10;&#10;	\N	2	5	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/-LL30JqMelQiFx51xjzIVg__original/img/xxc0HZxHgBnPPe5GNJ3kQ1Xyd4Q=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2750172.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/-LL30JqMelQiFx51xjzIVg__thumb/img/1zS0iG4Y_mY8RNwJqTZm6o5YztI=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2750172.jpg
300	252526	Pictomania (Second Edition)	Is she drawing an elk or a moose? Is he drawing a pegasus or a unicorn? These are the types of questions you will probably be asking yourself during a game of Pictomania!&#10;&#10;There's no time to draw a complex masterpiece in Pictomania, the drawing game in which everybody draws and everybody guesses &mdash; all at the same time! Players sketch the essence of the word with a few quick lines and try to guess the others' drawings while there's still time.&#10;&#10;This second edition of Pictomania features revised word cards with a brand new look. One big change for this edition compared to the base game is that only three word cards are in play no matter the player count, allowing you to jump into each round more quickly since you don't have to read as many words to guess who might be drawing what.&#10;&#10;	\N	3	6	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/AXnDLnuXrmbQRoFpCMvTJA__original/img/TKTOPSUFA-zKMipbpznhxY8E-XU=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4122381.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/AXnDLnuXrmbQRoFpCMvTJA__thumb/img/eBxAUMxxsKEagCdV_l-hBlh_mjs=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4122381.jpg

304	104363	Rex: Final Days of an Empire	Game description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;Rex: Final Days of an Empire, a reimagined version of Dune set in Fantasy Flight's Twilight Imperium universe, is a board game of negotiation, betrayal, and warfare in which 3-6 players take control of great interstellar civilizations, competing for dominance of the galaxy's crumbling imperial city. Set 3,000 years before the events of Twilight Imperium, Rex tells the story of the last days of the Lazax empire, while presenting players with compelling asymmetrical racial abilities and exciting opportunities for diplomacy, deception, and tactical mastery.&#10;&#10;In Rex: Final Days of an Empire, players vie for control of vital locations across a sprawling map of the continent-sized Mecatol City. Only by securing three key locations (or more, when allied with other factions) can a player assert dominance over the heart of a dying empire.&#10;&#10;Unfortunately, mustering troops in the face of an ongoing Sol blockade is difficult at best (unless, of course, you are the Federation of Sol or its faithless ally, the Hacan, who supply the blockading fleet). Savvy leaders must gather support from the local populace, uncover hidden weapon caches, and acquire control over key institutions. Mechanically, this means players must lay claim to areas that provide influence, which is then &quot;spent&quot; to (among other things) smuggle military forces through the orbiting Sol blockade. Those forces will be needed to seize the key areas of the city required to win the game. From the moment the first shot is fired, players must aggressively seek the means by which to turn the conflict to their own advantage.&#10;&#10;While the great races struggle for supremacy in the power vacuum of a dead emperor, massive Sol warships execute their devastating bombardments of the city below. Moving systematically, the Federation of Sol's fleet of warships wreaks havoc on the planet's surface, targeting great swaths of the game board with their destructive capabilities. Only the Sol's own ground forces have forewarning of the fleet's wrath; all others must seek shelter in the few locations with working defensive shields...or be obliterated in the resulting firestorm.&#10;&#10;Although open diplomacy and back-door dealmaking can often mitigate the need for bloodshed, direct combat may prove inevitable. When two or more opposing forces occupy the same area, a battle results. Each player's military strength is based on the sum total of troops he is willing to expend, along with the strength rating of his chosen leader. A faction's leaders can therefore be vitally important in combat...but beware! One or more of your Leaders may secretly be in the employ of an enemy, and if your forces in combat are commanded by such a traitor, defeat is all but assured. So whether on the field of battle or the floor of the Galactic Council, be careful in whom you place your trust.&#10;&#10;All this, along with a host of optional rules and additional variants, means that no two games of Rex: Final Days of an Empire will play exactly alike. Contributing further to replayability is the game's asymmetrical faction abilities, each of which offer a unique play experience.&#10;&#10;	\N	3	6	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/HFhHL5g_mSWx-wOj9DaG7g__original/img/5EcNv8iZdIJBBTmh0GrTdIr1d6s=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1246187.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/HFhHL5g_mSWx-wOj9DaG7g__thumb/img/ozRX0wtjJ9ghZgTc6K2Mn-ltj2o=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1246187.jpg

311	318983	Faiyum	The oasis-like basin Faiyum was artificially built 3,900 years ago by enlarging the Bahr Yussef channel that connected to the Nile to create a regulated flood plain. During the Middle Kingdom of Egypt, this swampland was slowly changed into farmland under the aegis of pharaohs such as Amenemhet III and Sesostris II. They ordered their advisors to build a system of canals and dikes to reclaim the land surrounded by desert and inhabited by crocodiles to turn it into a granary for Egypt.&#10;&#10;Now, during the reign of Amenemhet III, you are the pharaoh's advisors, commanded to harvest goods, build roads, found settlements, and do much more for the good of Faiyum! You are being supplied with the necessary manpower, resources, and money, which means that if another advisor needs to use &quot;your&quot; roads, farms, and other buildings, they may do so since everything you build is owned by the pharaoh. The only thing you will own is the only thing that matters: the respect of the pharaoh.&#10;&#10;Faiyum is a strategic game for enthusiasts of planning games. The basic rules are simple: Play your cards one by one on your personal discard stack. After playing some or all of your cards, you take them back into your hand in &quot;reverse&quot; playing order, so playing cards in the best order is important. Newly purchased cards go directly into your hand, so the timing of getting and playing them is important, too. Each of the individual cards has easy-to-understand actions, but only by creating the best combined &quot;engine&quot; will you be a master advisor of Faiyum.&#10;&#10;This game features a card mechanism reminiscent of deck builders and the market mechanism successfully used in Power Grid. Gain more and more valuable cards, and use the structures built on the game board to your advantage &mdash; in other words, for your reputation. In the end, the most cunning advisor who creates the best card combinations will win Faiyum.&#10;&#10;	\N	1	5	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/sl0ReaWGqY1LQjNoGtCPWg__original/img/9NqkDmUrzhYEOAOHGRE4zU6W71U=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5638086.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/sl0ReaWGqY1LQjNoGtCPWg__thumb/img/wH5S7oMLlZsHZ-K2RLcsXIXRyi0=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5638086.jpg

In each round, players interpret Dixit cards on a board after receiving a common clue word. Each player observes the Dixit cards and secretly associates these cards with the clue word, marking on their erasable personal slates the cards that they choose. Selecting the same cards as the other players allows you to score more points. Conversely, selecting a card that no one else chooses may cost you dearly.&#10;&#10;At the end of the fourth round, each player calculates their total score. Whoever has the most points &mdash; which is possibly more than one person &mdash; wins.&#10;&#10;Take calculated risks, but beware of the fall.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from publisher&#10;&#10;	\N	3	6	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/j3vn68o2ovUim3zh-JiWIA__original/img/hQyaMSdfLsbyghE-mZ6T5HI3M_s=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic6738101.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/j3vn68o2ovUim3zh-JiWIA__thumb/img/J-AoVapdE_5tkdmPRe39ltN0FwU=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6738101.jpg
313	21523	Runebound: Second Edition	Runebound is a classic adventure game from Fantasy Flight Games in which mighty heroes must take on the perils of Terrinoth. The game can be largely played without conflict between the players but victory can only be claimed by the first player to defeat the Dragonlord Margath, so the players are actually in a race to level up and acquire powerful weapons, armour and allies in order to take on the final adversary.&#10;&#10;Runebound features a series of 4 Adventure Decks that helps to pace the speed of the game and ensures that the players level up by acquiring experience before they are ready to take on a harder set of challenges (events and monsters).&#10;&#10;Several of the key features of Runebound are that combat is played out in 3 phases, Ranged, Melee and Magic and a player has the ability to specialise in a particular discipline, although this may make them vulnerable against certain creatures. The game also features a novel movement system using a series of terrain dice.&#10;&#10;Runebound is playable solo and is expandable by many adventure packs that alter the final challenge (replacing the Dragonlord for example). Runebound 2nd Edition also has a series of big box expansions that provide a new map or central map overlay to alter the game in some way.&#10;&#10;Runebound 2nd Edition is different from 1st Edition in that the original game featured a d20 and this was replaced by 2 10-sided dice, which helped to better balance the luck factor.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	6	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/9ihKYaEPIQD7d1KkTWfFpQ__original/img/Tf_yZ6myNWnWkY6lyMvBvLU7g9s=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic178189.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/9ihKYaEPIQD7d1KkTWfFpQ__thumb/img/JQGLbThEtF14BEuaf6RHi4cWm-4=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic178189.jpg
314	16992	Tsuro	From the publisher:&#10;&#10;A beautiful and beautifully simple game of laying a tile before your own token to continue its path on each turn.  The goal is to keep your token on the board longer than anyone else's, but as the board fills up this becomes harder because there are fewer empty spaces left... and another player's tile may also extend your own path in a direction you'd rather not go.  Easy to introduce to new players, Tsuro lasts a mere 15 minutes and actually does work for any number from 2 to 8.&#10;&#10;Theme:&#10;&#10;Tsuro has an Asian spiritual theme - the lines representing the &quot;many roads that lead to divine wisdom&quot;, and the game as a whole representing &quot;the classic quest for enlightenment&quot;.&#10;&#10;This theme is very light and the game essentially plays as an abstract.&#10;&#10;Gameplay:&#10;&#10;The game consists of tiles with twisting lines on them, a 6x6 grid on which to lay these tiles and a token for each player. Each player has a hand of tiles. On your turn you do two things: place a tile from your hand onto the board next to your token and move your token as far as it can go along the line it is currently on, until it is stopped by an empty space with no tile in (yet), the edge of the board or colliding with another player's token. If your token reaches the edge of the board or collides with another player's token, you are out of the game. The aim of the game is to be the last player left with a token on the board. Strategy therefore consists of trying to drive your opponents either into each other or off the board whilst extending your own route in directions that will make it difficult for your opponents to do the same.&#10;&#10;Other notes:&#10;&#10;Tsuro was originally patented by McMurchie in 1979 under the name Squiggle Game, but was apparently not published at that time.  Somewhat similar to Metro and Spaghetti Junction.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	8	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/2V3d4ryhxkS3RoPtDrvpUw__original/img/TP5U-O2eujPBK9IVmmifdfkWwdQ=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic875761.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/2V3d4ryhxkS3RoPtDrvpUw__thumb/img/NWgNhoxUIF7Lmj1apRkZQhFL6NU=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic875761.jpg

316	122522	Smash Up	The &quot;shufflebuilding&quot; game Smash Up begins with a simple premise: take the 20-card decks of two factions, shuffle them into a deck of forty cards, then compete to crush more Bases than your opponents! Each faction involves a different gaming mechanism - the pirates move the cards, the zombies bring back the cards from the discard pile, the dinosaurs have enormous power - and each combination of factions brings a different gaming experience.&#10;&#10;During the game, basic cards (each with their own difficulties and abilities) are at stake. You try to have the most power on the basis of your minions when the base is broken. Sounds easy? Is it easy when an opponent's Alien-Ninja decides to tie your minions to other Bases - flat Murder them? What happens when the Pirate-Dinosaur Full Sails player and frees King Rex to trample your minions in the ground, or when wizard-zombies use their mystic power to create an outbreak, suddenly flooding minions on the base of the discard pile? Or if you were facing a Zombie-Dinosaur player instead and he created an epidemic of massive beasts at the same time?!?&#10;&#10;When a base is smashed, each player in first, second and third place scores points. Fourth place? Sorry, brother, next time.&#10;&#10;With eight different factions, Smash Up includes dozens of combinations to try. Pirate-Aliens play different Ninja-Aliens, for example. Which one will you use to crush your opponents?&#10;&#10;And did we mention dinosaurs have laser beams?&#10;&#10;Integrates with:&#10;&#10;    Smash Up: Munchkin&#10;    Smash Up: Pretty Pretty Smash Up&#10;    Smash Up: The Big Geeky Box&#10;    Smash Up: Science Fiction Double Feature&#10;    Smash Up: Monster Smash&#10;    Smash Up: The Obligatory Cthulhu Set&#10;    Smash Up: Awesome Level 9000&#10;    Smash Up: It's Your Fault!&#10;    Smash Up: Cease and Desist&#10;&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/c1DOHkXD35OcqfPoxoSXlA__original/img/QhTMABCVrt58dLsps9sAWEu8CpI=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1269874.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/c1DOHkXD35OcqfPoxoSXlA__thumb/img/kdzBzdj4prsoztFNEFZ6eWv1RVI=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1269874.jpg

The dreamer can guess what the element of the Dream is at any time, placing the card to the good spirits team side if the guess was correct and in the naughty spirits pile if it was not. &#10;At the end of the round the Dreamer and the good spirits get a point for every card in the good spirits pile, when the naughty spirits get one point for every card in the naughty spirits pile. The tricksters get points according to how well balanced the two teams were at the end of the round, gaining extra points if they managed to equally balance the two piles.&#10;&#10;At the end of the round, the dreamer must use the words he guessed and story-tell his dream for extra points before he opens his eyes.&#10;&#10;You can learn how to play in a few minutes and have a great laugh right from the start.

320	319910	Pagan: Fate of Roanoke	Pagan: Fate of Roanoke&nbsp;from&nbsp;Kasper Kj&aelig;r Christiansen&nbsp;and&nbsp;K&aring;re Werner Storgaard is a deduction expandable card game set in colonial America of 1587. The essence of the asymmetrical game is the witch's struggle against the witch hunter. As the witch strives to complete a ritual, the hunter tries to track her down and find out her true identity. Both players access variable card decks with 50 cards each and use different resources to defeat the other side. Many tactics and strategies are possible and necessary to survive in this fight between the two powers. Embedded in the dark graphics of illustrator Maren Gutt the fictional story of the lost colony of Roanoke comes to life.&#10;&#10;Pagan is an asymmetrical card game for 2 players taking on the roles of witch or witch hunter. The witch tries to carry out a ritual of renaturation before being exposed by the witch hunter and terminated. Nine villagers are under suspicion and only the Witch player knows who is the real witch. Each turn the two players use their action pawns on active villagers to draw cards, play cards, and gain influence. Moreover, the witch can brew powerful potions, improve their familiar, and cast enchantments and charms, while the witch hunter enlists allies, claim strategic locations, and ruthlessly investigates the villagers.&#10;&#10;In Pagan, two players compete to be the first to complete their individual objective. As the Witch, your objective is to collect enough secrets to perform a ritual so potent, that the entire region will fall under your spell and Mother Nature will reclaim the Island. As the Hunter, you gather all the allies and support you can muster, to bring the Witch to justice before its fatal ritual comes to fruition.&#10;&#10;The prototype has already won the Danish design award Otto at the Fastaval for best game of show in 2018.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;	\N	2	2	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/rDVo_h2DLjKIyTDGpYye-Q__original/img/CisR-Jea1v3VHLC6Z0l8DCGsgtY=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5697622.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/rDVo_h2DLjKIyTDGpYye-Q__thumb/img/cSVU9JzRq4C454GUhgUyeyIcO5E=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5697622.jpg

While the knights are only moved by the corresponding player, Merlin can be moved by all players, which makes integrating Merlin in one's plan a tricky endeavor.&#10;&#10;There are multiple ways to score victory points such as defeating barbarians, building manors in the surrounding area and increasing one's influence in the six counties.

Take a typical deckbuilding game, add the speed and fun of dice and in 60 minutes you&rsquo;re on your second or third game trying unique strategies against your opponents.&#10;&#10;Alternate Description of Quarriors&#10;&#10;In Quarriors, each player plays as a Quarrior competing for Glory in the eyes of Quiana, the Empress of Quaridia. Each player starts with an identical set of 12 dice in their dice bag. At the start of the game, Creature and Spell dice (Quarry) are dealt at random to form &quot;the Wilds&quot; in the center of the table. As play progresses, players roll their dice to attempt to summon Creatures, cast Spells, and harness the magical power of Quiddity (the in-game resource) to capture Quarry from the Wilds to add to their repertoire and into their dice bag. Players draw and roll 6 dice a turn from their bag, making that controlling bag composition is key to victory.&#10;&#10;Quarriors is a fast-paced game where players must strategically balance their choices each turn. Do I use my Quiddity to summon Creatures in the hopes of scoring Glory or should I spend it all to capture more powerful Quarry from the Wilds? Players must outmaneuver their opponent's through strategic Spell use, the acquisition of powerful Quarry, and ultimately, by striking down opponent's Creature in combat. If your Creatures survive until your next turn, you will score Glory points and move closer to victory!&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/12Bgvi0MpA10redngwI5MA__original/img/i2BO-n_bbR4Du2iV3dQtjMd0U1w=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1604985.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/12Bgvi0MpA10redngwI5MA__thumb/img/z985bdF5fL4hmuWuQUa5QLSmpYA=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1604985.jpg

331	175199	Mottainai	&quot;Mottainai&quot; (pronounced mot/tai/nai or like the English words mote-tie-nigh) means &quot;Don't waste&quot;, or &quot;Every little thing has a soul&quot;. In the game Mottainai, a successor in the Glory to Rome line, you use your cards for many purposes. Each player is an acolyte in a temple who performs tasks, collects materials, and sells or completes works for visitors. Every card can be each of these three things.&#10;&#10;You choose tasks to allow you to perform actions, keeping in mind that other players will get to follow up on your task on their next turn. Clever planning and combining of your works' special abilities is key, as is managing which materials you sell.&#10;&#10;Mottainai is a quick, but deep, game experience.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	5	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/CTOlrpzG8J6JxkCnrL_cPw__original/img/JW4j6faFmXvDA9tD0_DSJmQRYdA=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2688214.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/CTOlrpzG8J6JxkCnrL_cPw__thumb/img/dnbQMm4EEd49clYRara1V5S9DEQ=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2688214.jpg
332	60	Vinci	Along the lines of History of the World by The Avalon Hill Game Co, players cycle through a series of European civilizations as they attempt to score the most points using the civilization's special powers.  The game is set in Europe. Each player is provided with a pool of wooden tokens to represent their civilizations.  Each player selects a combination of civilization tiles, which give his civilization special abilities or characteristics.  Players enlarge their empires through territorial expansion, often at the expense of other players.  The key to the game lies in choosing when to allow your active civilization to go into decline in order to select a new one that will generate more points.  Play continues with the cycling of civilizations until a certain score is reached, whereupon final rounds are played and a victor is determined.&#10;&#10;Reimplemented by:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Small World (released in March 2009)&#10;&#10;&#10;	\N	3	6	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/16rNX4_Zj2nUtfKP7d1Wxw__original/img/tMG5f6Jgt1XKTXbHnFWJrWFpzo8=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic168171.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/16rNX4_Zj2nUtfKP7d1Wxw__thumb/img/9LgknaiMCuT4jFlsyPO8j2I1U7E=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic168171.jpg
333	181796	The Prodigals Club	Welcome to The Prodigals Club! You and your fellows are proper Victorian gentlemen who have realized that the lower classes have more fun. Now you are in a friendly competition to see which of you can destroy his own social standing most thoroughly.&#10;&#10;In The Prodigals Club, you compete in three separate competitions: trying to lose an election, trying to get rid of all your possessions, or trying to offend the most influential people in high society. You can play any two competitions in combination or play all three simultaneously. Each competition interacts with the other two. To win, you need to balance your strategy and play all the competitions well.&#10;&#10;The Prodigals Club is thematically related to Vladim&iacute;r Such&yacute;'s Last Will.

334	85897	Thunderstone: Dragonspire	Thunderstone: Dragonspire is a fantasy deck-building game much in the style of Dominion. Before the game starts a selection of Village and Hero cards will be randomly chosen that players may add to their specific decks. Like Dominion, every player starts with a basic deck of weaker cards that they can use to purchase other more powerful cards. In Thunderstone these cards may be different Heroes such as mages, archers, thieves, or warriors; or they may be supplies the heroes need like weapons, rations, or light to reach further into the dungeon.&#10;&#10;A dungeon deck is also created by combining several different groups of monsters together. Certain groups of monsters may be more or less susceptible to different Hero types so players must take this into account when they choose what to buy.&#10;&#10;Rather than buying puny Victory Points, players will use their deck to defeat monsters in the dungeon. From the monster deck a row of cards is laid out. On their turn, players may choose to visit either the dungeon or the village. Plays can purchase other cards for their deck or level up their heroes in the village. If they instead go to the dungeon, they play their heroes, weapons, items, and spells to defeat any one of the available monsters. The deeper the monster is in the dungeon, the more light is needed or the monster will gain power. Some monsters also have special abilities which may hinder the player. If they have enough strength they defeat the monster and place that card in their deck. This card is worth victory points and often can be used as money to purchase other cards. In addition to this players are awarded experience points for defeating monsters which can be used to upgrade their heroes into more powerful versions. The game is played until the Thunderstone is revealed from the dungeon and a player is able to claim it. The player with the most victory points in their deck is the winner.&#10;&#10;From the publisher:&#10;&#10;Thunderstone returns with Dragonspire! Featuring all-new art for every card (even Militia and Daggers), experience point tokens (not cards!), and the all new &quot;Setting&quot; cards which alter the game on a global scale.  Dragonspire includes 18 new village cards, 11 new heroes, and 8 new monster sets.&#10;&#10;With enough cards to play the game right out of the box, this is a great Thunderstone edition for those just getting into the game.&#10;&#10;Dragonspire also has a new storage box format, plastic XP tokens, and a brand new Dungeon board to help players keep up with light and darkness.&#10;&#10;Thunderstone: Dragonspire is not a an expansion, but is instead a separate stand-alone game that may be played along with components of Thunderstone.&#10;&#10;NOTE: The Dragon-Humanoid divider included with the game is meant for a future expansion as a promo.&#10;&#10;	\N	1	5	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/P3leDpredE7MnVMZtd6J0g__original/img/4ZtoXrJgyZqXDFQZcrwMIfyL_Xs=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic837358.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/P3leDpredE7MnVMZtd6J0g__thumb/img/iXamEqwaAB5wSLxBqL9H6bc5ZsU=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic837358.jpg
368	234669	Legacy of Dragonholt	Gather your band of heroes and journey to Realms of Terrinoth in Legacy of Dragonholt!&#10;&#10;The first game to use the Oracle system, Legacy of Dragonholt captures the spirit of a roleplaying game without needing a game master. This narrative game for one to six players allows players to build their own unique hero and embark on six noble quests. Battle goblins, foil the plot of an evil lord, and add a new story to your tale!&#10;&#10;Prepare for Adventure&#10;Legacy of Dragonholt is a narrative adventure game that creates a unique experience by blending aspects of roleplaying and adventure games, open world concept video games, and even Choose Your Own Adventure books. Unlike many games, Legacy of Dragonholt is not about winning or losing, but rather about the act of creating a story. Without the need for a Game Master, this game ensures that every player has the opportunity to shape how their adventure plays out while its intuitive gameplay means that you waste little time before jumping into your tale.&#10;&#10;Before you first set out on your adventure, you must confront one of the most difficult questions in gaming: who will you become? Legacy of Dragonholt gives you the opportunity to play as one of six humanoid races that reside in Terrinoth: humans, elves, dwarves, orcs, gnomes, and catfolk. Next, you'll select a class, before defining your physical and personality traits, and scribing a personal history. Each of these features creates a multifaceted character and defines the types of traits you possess, which in turn affect how you will approach obstacles throughout your journey and how you'll contribute to your party. For an in-depth look at the character creation process, you may look at our previous article here. Once you've created your own unique character, you're ready to dive in to a narrative adventure unlike any you&rsquo;ve seen before.&#10;&#10;Explore The Realm&#10;Once your journey begins, Legacy of Dragonholt combines two forms of gameplay between the comprehensive Village Book and the six quest books that provide the plotlines of your tales. Within Dragonholt Village, you will encounter many colorful characters, each with their own stories that progress and interweave regardless of your involvement. The world is yours to explore, but it is not yours to control. Like a real community, the places you can explore vary depending on when you visit, and your encounters with the locals change depending on your traits and past experiences. For instance, a bakery may only be open early in the day, and the baker themselves may take a shine to you if you&rsquo;ve already met their cousin, or if they&rsquo;ve heard of the great deeds you&rsquo;ve accomplished earlier in your stay in the village. Outside the relative safety of the village, thrilling dangers and mysteries await that you can experience in six unique quests. You will investigate strange happenings within in the village and venture into the wilds beyond to journey through deep woods, delve into dark crypts, and confront creatures long thought dead. As you progress throughout the game you will find that, like your village experience, your quests also change based on your past experience, who you have or have not met, and how much time has passed. After all, if you learn that someone is in peril to the west of Dragonholt Village, they are not likely to wait patiently for three days while you explore in the east. Your actions have consequences, but ultimately the choice lies with you. You do not have to be a hero. This is your story, and it is yours to define.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;	\N	1	6	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/RAdppZ1_dduI7vnJi3mtZQ__original/img/evc4kIOTJl3PEC1opktfjRNZtzI=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3754388.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/RAdppZ1_dduI7vnJi3mtZQ__thumb/img/lSVVIS6MP8Hvn_qLj7DAHYQtl-4=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3754388.jpg
338	1301	Netrunner	Netrunner is a cyberpunk-themed collectible card game.  The two players are the Corp (who wins by completing Agendas) and the Runner (who wins by infiltrating the Corp and liberating Agendas).&#10;&#10;Each side has a limited number of both actions and bits (money) to spend per turn; bits are gone once used, and actions must be spent to gain more.&#10;An important thing when evaluating the power of cards is to see the Bit per action ratio.&#10;&#10;One unique feature of this game is that the Runner physically moves on the &quot;board&quot; created by facedown Corp cards.  It has the feel of a &quot;capture the flag&quot; game, with the Runner moving in dataforts to steal Agendas from the Corp.&#10;&#10;Another unique feature is that the Cards are NOT the primary strategy of the game; in fact, players can win by simply &quot;playing with the rules&quot; itself (a concept difficult to understand if you've never played Netrunner).&#10;&#10;Both players play as both Corp and Runner in a game, one after the other, with each player's Runner going against the opponent's Corp.  A winning match provides 10 points and the loser scores points equal to the number of agenda points scored/liberated. The winner of the game is the one who has the most points in the 2 submatches.&#10;&#10;Though Netrunner is traditionally a two-player duel, there are formats that allow for more players (called &quot;The Big Sell Out&quot;).&#10;&#10;	\N	2	2	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Xv_C5PpqX8kDwU-8iktmgQ__original/img/C4u4nrMitMztbos3TN8SjIL87_w=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic92015.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Xv_C5PpqX8kDwU-8iktmgQ__thumb/img/cmWb4qmyF5aLkAmrj7fhe77ODlo=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic92015.jpg
339	37628	Haggis	Haggis is a climbing game in the same family as Zheng Fen and Big Two.

340	221	Ikusa	Shogun / Samurai Swords is the last game in the original Milton Bradley Gamemaster series. It was later rereleased by HAH under the name Ikusa. The game focuses on the chaotic feudal society of Japan during the Middle Ages. Players play one of several factions that erupt into a civil war, trying to consolidate their strongholds and then defeat other armies for the right to be called Shogun, the supreme ruler.&#10;&#10;In the game, players command forces on islands of feudal Japan.  Player forces include provincial forces in the provinces and mobile armies commanded by daimyos.  In each turn, players will allocate their koku into bids and purchases for the round.  The round begins with the allocation of turn order, which is determined by bid, and in the case of tied bids, by player agreement or random draw.  Then players other bids and payments are accounted for in purchases of castles and fortresses, drafting of new troops and ronin, and a bid for the lone ninja.  Following the bids phase, players in turn order plan and execute attacks against enemy territories, with attacks resolved through die rolls.  A player wins the game when he or she has captured a certain number of territories, either via straight conquest or by vanquishing the last of an opponent's diamyos and taking over that player's forces.&#10;&#10;The game was originally published as Shogun and was later changed to Samurai Swords due to a name conflict with James Clavell's Shogun. Ikusa is the latest iteration of the game.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	5	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/fwG7yJFb4Py3ZGRNXHIYEw__original/img/To7hx1UUqgDS271spiodHss2Lkw=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1050037.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/fwG7yJFb4Py3ZGRNXHIYEw__thumb/img/QDGmr3zU-g0sjtCe_3WkQY7qP5o=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1050037.jpg

Land in a cup, and you get to stack it on your player board; land in a cup on someone else's board, and you get to move it to yours.

343	18100	China	China is an abstracted game of political influence in China. Players use cards to place pieces (Houses or Emissaries) into the nine regions on the board. When all house spaces in a region are filled (or at the end of the game), players score for majorities of houses in that region. At game end, players then score for having majorities of emissaries in two adjacent regions. Players also score for having four or more houses in an uninterrupted sequence along one of the roads on the board.&#10;&#10;This fascinating game of domination combines multiple tactical possibilities with simple-to-learn rules and a short playing time!&#10;&#10;Even today in China, the unmistakable evidence of a fascinating story is everywhere. Hundreds of years ago, the country teetered on the brink of a change in power. Regional rulers fought continuously with each other with only one goal in mind: to become the new Emperor. They erected imposing houses and sent their emissaries to the regional courts.&#10;&#10;China is based on the award-winning game Web of Power by master game designer Michael Schacht. China differs from Web of Power in that there is no &quot;half-time&quot; scoring of regions as there is in the earlier game; there are four face-up cards to draw from instead of just two; and all adjacent regions have Emissary scoring opportunities, whereas in Web of Power, some adjacent regions did not. &#10;A special variant with fortifications is included.&#10;&#10;Aside from these differences, the two games are essentially the same.&#10;&#10;	\N	3	5	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/JpLM08UVFMBTpxg2_L71Ug__original/img/pera_XSRM3I1nAH69mP8VzOUb0s=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic63275.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/JpLM08UVFMBTpxg2_L71Ug__thumb/img/tpNmOUjT0PXk5eki_BthGcG2CsQ=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic63275.jpg
344	206051	Insider	Do we really have free will? Who decides this? Are we controlled by what we hear and what we see, even while thinking we decide freely? Insider is a game that deals with these questions. While communicating to others, you have to find the right answers to a quiz or find the &quot;insider&quot; who is manipulating the discussion. The insider will do everything to hide their identity while misleading the others.&#10;&#10;In more detail, players are assigned roles at random. One player is the &quot;master&quot;, and they secretly select a word from a set given in a deck of cards. (In a variant given in the rulebook, they can freely select and write down a word.) The &quot;insider&quot; player, whose role is not known to the other players, will then secretly view the word. The rest of the players are known as &quot;commons&quot;. The commons then have approximately five minutes in which to ask the master &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;-type questions so that they can deduce the secret word. The insider attempts to secretly lead the commons towards the correct word. If the commons fail to guess the correct word, everyone loses.&#10;&#10;If, however, the word is correctly guessed in the allowable time, the master flips the sand timer, and the commons and master have until the sand runs out to discuss the game and deduce the identity of the insider. If they guess correctly, they win the game together; if they do not, the insider wins.&#10;&#10;	\N	4	8	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/VW7K2SmGbr-Eim9nNhxfJw__original/img/UY2k4aU_0kF24cYks1b0awwE3gU=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3325362.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/VW7K2SmGbr-Eim9nNhxfJw__thumb/img/0eBd_mdXuJE_sHVMZHawEHenSvM=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3325362.jpg
345	24068	Shadow Hunters	Shadow Hunters is a survival board game set in a devil-filled forest in which three groups of characters&mdash;the Shadows, creatures of the night; the Hunters, humans who try to destroy supernatural creatures; and the Neutrals, civilians caught in the middle of this ancient battle&mdash;struggle against each other to survive.&#10;&#10;You belong to one of these groups and must conceal your identity from others since you don't know whom you can trust&mdash;at least not initially. Over time, though, someone might decipher who you are through your actions or through Hermit cards, or you might even reveal yourself to use your special ability.&#10;&#10;The key to victory is to identify your allies and enemies early because once your identity is revealed, your enemies will attack with impunity using their special abilities like Demolish, Teleport, and Suck Blood or their equipment cards such as the Rusty Broad Ax or Fortune Brooch. This ancient battle comes to a head and only one group will stand victorious&mdash;or a civilian, in the right circumstances, might claim victory.&#10;&#10;The 2011 edition of Shadow Hunters from Z-Man Games includes the Shadow Hunters: Expansion, a set of ten new characters previously sold separately.&#10;&#10;	\N	4	8	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/_eXzp4yCWA4_b-VmFQf3IA__original/img/Q74kX8HEBSQZLsZ9G_N_C3q3v1o=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1215982.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/_eXzp4yCWA4_b-VmFQf3IA__thumb/img/CbkIn6FQ-CU8vl3C-8VWNTcdZi8=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1215982.jpg

The hedgehog wants to stand on top of the pyramid but the height is making him dizzy.&#10;&#10;Tier auf Tier (a.k.a.

Of course, if any pieces fall off whilst you are building, you get up to two of them back.

348	142326	Eight-Minute Empire: Legends	Build a small empire in a land of legends!&#10;&#10;Eight-Minute Empire: Legends is a standalone sequel to the area control game Eight-Minute Empire and does not require the original game to play.

The card has an action that the player takes immediately, and actions help players take over the map &ndash; but what's new and different in this version?&#10;&#10;&#10;    Instead of goods, cards now have special abilities, which give players unique advantages and ways to break the rules throughout the game&#10;    Each card has a unique, beautiful illustration of a fantasy creature or location&#10;    A modular board for increased variety&#10;    New variants&#10;&#10;&#10;Is Eight-Minute Empire: Legends still playable in eight minutes? Yes, but only if you hurry!&#10;&#10;Eight-Minute Empire: Legends is a quick game that implements the Civilization/Exploration theme using card-driven area control (by placing armies and cities in a small map) and set collection (by getting abilities from the cards). Players spread through the map in order to collect points at the end of the game by having majorities in regions and continents. All actions (such as land or sea movement, army production, or the founding of cities) are driven by cards that are face-up (six at a time) and available by increasing prices. Cards also belong to sets, which also give points when the game ends if properly collected.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/4aL5A2NIxKmITsXZboABvw__original/img/f1g5F2zkWi63MiVvaO2d3PpuGAA=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1708628.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/4aL5A2NIxKmITsXZboABvw__thumb/img/41zP3EQvuAQGa64VFBhu72oxCpU=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1708628.jpg

351	271319	Las Vegas Royale	Las Vegas Royale combines the original Las Vegas dice game from 2012 with some elements of the Las Vegas Boulevard expansion from 2014.&#10;&#10;Las Vegas is an easy-to-learn, dice-rolling game that includes six cardboard casino mats, one for each side of a normal six-sided die. For each mat in the basic game, players draw money cards until at least $50k is showing, but the amount may end up being a lot more, making that casino more desirable.&#10;&#10;Each player has eight dice of a different color, which they take turns rolling. When you roll your dice, you can choose to place them on the relevant casino cards; for example, a die showing a 1 will be placed on the casino mat marked &quot;1&quot;. You must place all dice of one number on one casino in your turn. All players take turns doing this until all the dice have been used. Finally, the player with the most dice on each casino card takes the highest-valued money associated with it, then the player with the secondmost dice takes the next highest-valued money card. In case of a tie, the non-tied player with the most dice takes the highest-valued money card at that casino, while the tied players get bupkis.&#10;&#10;Las Vegas Royale includes twelve expansion tiles, and to play a more involved game, you can place an expansion tile at random by each casino. These tiles have special abilities on them, and by placing dice on them, players can activate these abilities. The expansion components also include a larger than normal die for each player that counts as two dice.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	5	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/4BDkj75aMObXau8L08jX5w__original/img/NLdUQTH9CQX5FgaqCcNbmAccQr8=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4673729.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/4BDkj75aMObXau8L08jX5w__thumb/img/ICsFoIjh4k2TlrByRP_sWL9sDKw=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4673729.jpg

354	222514	Batman: Gotham City Chronicles	In Batman: Gotham City Chronicles, one villain faces off against a team of heroes in one of multiple scenarios. Each hero has their own character, and they control this character by spending energy to perform actions (such as Melee and Ranged attacks, defusing bombs...) recovering more or less energy at the beginning of their turn depending on their stance. If the hero gets damaged, energy moves to a wound area, and if they lose all of their energy, then they're out of action for a while to recover their strength. Each hero has differing strengths for their abilities, and these strengths are represented by colored dice with different values; the more energy a hero spends on an ability, the more dice of that color they can roll.&#10;&#10;The villain controls a team of henchmen and iconic villains of the Batman universe, and these characters are represented by tiles on their command board, with the characters costing 1, 2, 3, etc. energy to activate as you move left to right down the line. Once a character is activated, they move to the end of the line, boosting their cost to the maximum value should you want to use them again immediately, and decreasing the cost of the other tiles.&#10;&#10;The game-play in Batman: Gotham City Chronicles is based on that of Conan, with revisions to character abilities, the addition of two different types of dice (w/ five types total), and a modified two-player set-up, the Versus Mode, in which each player has a command board and their own team of tiles that they can draft, with heroes facing off against villains.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/YGNk9UF-QqLWT58aWiRV7w__original/img/KdB7vv0-cUujU4-eE3udGR1xYKA=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic3893551.png	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/YGNk9UF-QqLWT58aWiRV7w__thumb/img/OJRkVH8OmPyCtrpExfCW63phnkE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3893551.png

356	176544	Automania	In Automania, you run a car factory, trying to produce the most popular cars in the market. To achieve this, you buy tiles to upgrade and customize your factory, and hire specialist employees to help you.&#10;&#10;Central to the game are the factory boards: Each player has a factory with three assembly lines, and each assembly line produces one type of car. You can put machine tiles along your assembly lines to change the specifications of your cars. However, your three assembly lines intersect, so each machine tile placed might affect more than one type of car &mdash; which means you have to think carefully about where you put those machines.&#10;&#10;When a car is produced, it must be sold in one of two markets, and the better the specifications of the car is in line with the demand in the chosen market, the more popular the car will be. The most popular cars reap the highest profits, earning money or prestige &mdash; which is what you need to win this game.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/fPIcD46QczD1Og8EUafUTw__original/img/WlD-PrL3ETDG9JemVquElolw2Gs=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3749920.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/fPIcD46QczD1Og8EUafUTw__thumb/img/U72WAOEnl64mhQ5bqd3Tqkbh4N0=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3749920.jpg

357	129736	Cockroach Poker Royal	As in its parent game Kakerlakenpoker, Kakerlakenpoker Royal has nothing to do with poker &ndash; except that the game is all about bluffing, but with cards showing cockroaches, rats and stink bugs instead of queens, 10s and aces. To set up the game, shuffle the deck and deal the cards out to players. On a turn, a player takes one card from his hand, lays it face down on the table, slides it to a player of his choice, and declares a type of critter, e.g., &quot;Stink bug&quot;. The player receiving the card either:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Accepts the card, says either &quot;true&quot; or &quot;false&quot;, then reveals the card. If this player is wrong in her claim, she keeps the card on the table in front of her face up; if she is right, the player who gave her the card places it face up before him.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    Passes the card to another player, peeking at it first, then keeping it face-down and either saying the original type of critter or saying a new type. This new player again has the choice of accepting the card or passing it, unless the card has already been seen by all other players in which case the player must accept it and make a true/false claim.&#10;&#10;&#10;The game ends when a player has no cards to pass on his turn or when a player has four cards of the same critter on the table in front of him. In either case, this player loses and everyone else wins.&#10;&#10;To this, Kakerlakenpoker Royal adds new rules and new nasty &quot;royal&quot; critters to create more options for players during the game.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	6	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/loNpxkO1sWM_Xs4Pk2AMgA__original/img/jM2Vk0_umdKL9hrsBK_ePnzqptk=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4129570.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/loNpxkO1sWM_Xs4Pk2AMgA__thumb/img/-Njqo9AWuBO_P0H94U_f1lJW1hA=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4129570.jpg
358	229265	Wendake	&quot;Wendake&quot; is the name that the Wyandot people use for their traditional territory. This population, also known as the Huron Nation, lived in the Great Lakes region, together with the tribes who formed the Iroquois Confederacy, and many others. In this game, you will explore the traditions and everyday life of these tribes during the 1756&ndash;1763 period, when the Seven Years&rsquo; War between the French and the English took place in these territories.&#10;&#10;But this white man&rsquo;s war is only a marginal aspect of the game; the focus is on life in the native villages, fields, and forests. In this game, you won&rsquo;t find the traditional tipis, which were used by southwestern tribes who moved their camps to follow the bison herds. The natives of the Great Lakes were more sedentary, living in longhouses. The women farmed beans, corn, and pumpkins, while the men hunted beavers in the forests, mainly to sell their pelts as leather.&#10;&#10;In Wendake, you step into the shoes of the chief of a Native American tribe. You will have to manage the most important aspects of your tribe&rsquo;s daily existence, thereby earning points on the Economic, Military, Ritual, and Mask tracks. The core of the game is the action selection mechanism: you will have the opportunity to choose better and better actions over 7 years (i.e., rounds), and the winner will be the chief who finds the best combinations of actions and uses them to lead their tribe to prosperity!&#10;&#10;	\N	1	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/N_oaV30_ImihsgPhYAUyiQ__original/img/BfzNBdQu-iHq3nA9Dfnwhz06EyQ=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4110410.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/N_oaV30_ImihsgPhYAUyiQ__thumb/img/5Ux0lbcU6kZPSGW3SpKFQhdw9ww=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4110410.jpg

Open your minds and find the truth!&#10;&#10;Set in the lights of a 1950's US fairground, Mysterium Park shares the same core mechanism with the famous award-winning game it reimplements, though bringing a different approach: it is smaller and faster, thanks to very quick setup and simplified rules.&#10;&#10;Mysterium is a milestone in immersive and eye-catching experiences close to role-playing; with Mysterium Park, you can enjoy the heart of it in a more condensed way.&#10;&#10;&mdash; description from the publisher&#10;&#10;	\N	2	6	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/U2CYPYgIEC1cLF45Rh0UGw__original/img/472oJ1mqGHWxFxuOsnXFiZBshUc=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5581038.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/U2CYPYgIEC1cLF45Rh0UGw__thumb/img/bTRB0-Qnb-tvrYxN3vJJZRBEZ1s=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5581038.jpg
361	89409	BattleCON: War of Indines	BattleCON is a fast-paced head to head card game for 2 players, based loosely around the mechanics and tactics present in 2D fighting games. In BattleCON, players choose characters with unique abilities and powers to test against one another in a battle of tactics, strategy, and intuition.&#10;&#10;BattleCON: War of Indines is a standalone dueling card game designed for head-to-head play. Each player selects a character who uses a unique gameplay mechanism to give them an edge in combat. Take control of 18 different characters, from a fire elemental, an ocean guardian and her panda familiar, a space-bending trapper, a shadowy assassin, and more! Each character's play style requires new strategies, but uses the same foundational tactics, making a new character easy to learn, but challenging to master.&#10;&#10;Players move along a seven-space-long board, trading blows and attempting to strike the opponent, using attacks formed by combining a character's unique styles and abilities with a set of basic cards that all characters share. There is no hidden information: you always know exactly what cards the opponent holds, just not the ones they'll choose! The last player standing wins!&#10;&#10;BattleCON: War of Indines can be played on its own or combined with other BattleCON sets to create an even greater pool of characters and play variants.&#10;&#10;______________________________________________________________________________&#10;&#10;BattleCON: War of Indines has two versions, now dubbed &quot;Classic&quot; and &quot;Remastered.&quot;  The &quot;Classic&quot; version contained multiple art styles, as different fighters were drawn by different artists. This version contains multiple errors and outdated cards, and is now permanently out of print.&#10;&#10;The new &quot;Remastered&quot; version features the same 18 fighters, but updated to match the uniform art style of Devastation of Indines.  It also includes balance changes to a few fighters, new double-sided finishers, updated art and components, and a streamlined version of the rulebook that focuses on standard 2-player duels. The variants included with &quot;Classic&quot; that were removed in &quot;Remastered&quot; are still present in the Devastation rulebook and other expansions.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/AfUbbvjhx4Q3LFOIjy_d7g__original/img/jAxaAm8HFEYHDkaBgjZaTJKZgPc=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2039033.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/AfUbbvjhx4Q3LFOIjy_d7g__thumb/img/LMmSnD0OV6vHT9o0g_aJ0GRQnQU=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2039033.jpg
362	152162	Diamonds	Diamonds is a trick-taking card game in which players collect Diamonds &mdash; not cards bearing that suit, mind you, but rather actual &quot;Diamond Crystals&quot; (acrylic crystals) included in the game.&#10;&#10;What makes the game of Diamonds different from other trick-taking card games is that when you cannot follow suit you get a &quot;Suit Action&quot; based on what suit you do play. Suit Actions are also taken by the winner of each trick, as well as at the end of a full Round of play.&#10;&#10;Suit Actions will enable players to take Diamond Crystals from the Supply, moving them to their Showroom (where they may score 1 point) or to their Vault (where they will score 2 points). The Vault is a secure area, but the Showroom is vulnerable to theft by the other players.&#10;&#10;The deck in Diamonds consists of sixty cards, numbered 1-15 in the standard suits. In each round, the players start with a hand of ten cards. One player leads a card, and everyone else must play one card, following suit if possible.  As you play a card, if you cannot follow suit, you immediately get a Suit Action in the suit you did play. The player who played the highest card in the suit that was led wins the trick, and also gets a Suit Action.&#10; The player who won the trick leads a card to start the next trick. After a full Round of ten tricks, whoever has taken the most cards in each suit once again gets a Suit Action. If a player has taken no tricks, that player gets two Diamonds Suit Actions. Players then start a new round.&#10;&#10;Whoever has the most points in Diamond Crystals at the end of the game wins!&#10;&#10;	\N	2	6	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/jWa2swVQ1oJ_lmBjOqKvJA__original/img/kT1-MhelQgFGYSXiJsIZnQRG4zQ=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4812860.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/jWa2swVQ1oJ_lmBjOqKvJA__thumb/img/F4sphH6518FTStZ5iH10525L8Nc=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4812860.jpg

Players manage a hand of cards that provide different orders to your troops in the right flank, left flank and center position of the battlefield.&#10;&#10;This game is the first to use what would evolve into Richard Borg's Command and Colors system.&#10;&#10;The game rules include the following scenarios:&#10;First Bull Run--21st July, 1861&#10;Pea Ridge--7th March, 1862&#10;Kernstown--23rd March, 1862&#10;Shiloh--6th April, 1862&#10;Gaines Mill--27th June, 1862&#10;Brawner's Farm--28th August, 1862&#10;Antietam--17th September, 1862&#10;Fredericksburg--13th December, 1862&#10;Murfreesboro--31st December, 1862&#10;Chancellorsville--3rd May, 1863&#10;Gettysburg--2nd July, 1863&#10;Gettysburg--3rd July, 1863&#10;Chickamauga--20th September, 1863&#10;New Market--15th May, 1864&#10;New Hope Church--25th May, 1864&#10;&#10;	\N	2	2	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/NQtwxlqZJveWv0Sm9SZVSg__original/img/a_S_P0dbH5q51nJTsrMb4ENNoak=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic6531255.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/NQtwxlqZJveWv0Sm9SZVSg__thumb/img/CkPgv8E1sK6fdzJEn_0T2xET6Hw=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6531255.jpg
364	91080	Andean Abyss	(from GMT website:)&#10;&#10;Colombia: Nation at the Edge of Abyss&#10;&#10;Colombia in the 1990s hosted one of the world&rsquo;s last Marxist guerrilla armies, brutal drug lords, and right-wing death squads and appeared close to failing as a state.  A decade later, its Marxists had lost their top leaders and rural sanctuary, its big drug bosses were dead or in prison, and its paramilitaries were negotiating demobilization.  The Government had extended its writ to most of the countryside, restored its popularity, and improved the economy and respect for human rights.&#10;&#10;Andean Abyss takes 1 to 4 players into this multifaceted campaign for control of Colombia:  guerrillas and police, kidnapping and drug war, military sweeps and terror.  Each of four factions deploys distinct capabilities and tactics to influence Colombian affairs and achieve differing goals.  Players place and maneuver 160 wooden pieces across a colorful map and exploit event cards that cannot be fully predicted.  Accessible mechanics and components put the emphasis on game play, but Andean Abyss also provides an engrossing model of insurgency and counterinsurgency in Colombia&mdash;smoothly accounting for population control, lines of communication, terrain, intelligence, foreign aid, sanctuaries, and a host of other political, military, and economic factors.&#10;&#10;A New Kind of Card-Assisted Wargame&#10; From the award-winning designer of Wilderness War and Labyrinth, Andean Abyss features unique mechanics relating events and operations that guarantee difficult player decisions with each card flip.  Most of the game&rsquo;s 72 events are dual-use, representing alternative historical paths:  players can choose either version of the event or from an array of operations and special faction activities.  Every choice has implications for how the next card will be played.  There is no hand management:  the focus is on the map and on planning for the foreseeable&mdash;and the unforeseeable.  Die rolls are only a small part of game:  the key to victory is not luck but the ability to organize the most effective campaign.&#10;&#10;Multiplayer, 2-Player, Solitaire&#10;&#10;Andean Abyss provides up to 4 players with contrasting roles and overlapping victory conditions for rich diplomatic interaction.  For 2- or 3-player games, players can represent alliances of factions, or the game system can control non-player factions .  Or a single player as the Colombian Government can take on the leftist FARC, the right-wing AUC, and the narco-trafficking cartels.  The non-player insurgents will fight one another as well as the players, but too much power in the hands of any one of them will mean player defeat.&#10;&#10;Series: COIN (GMT), Volume I&#10;&#10;Andean Abyss presents a game system on modern insurgency readily adaptable to other conflicts, particularly those featuring the interaction of many sides (thus our new COunterINsurgency series).  A rich and under-represented history of guerrilla warfare beckons.   Series: COIN (GMT) Volume II is Cuba Libre&#226;&#128;&#148;Castro's Insurgency 1957-1958, Volume III is A Distant Plain&#226;&#128;&#148;Insurgency in Afghanistan, and Volume IV is Fire in the Lake&#226;&#128;&#148;Insurgency in Vietnam.&#10;&#10;TIME SCALE: multiple years per Propaganda round&#10;MAP SCALE: Area Movement&#10;UNIT SCALE: Varies&#10;NUMBER OF PLAYERS: 1-4 (full solitaire system)&#10;&#10;DESIGNER: Volko Ruhnke&#10;DEVELOPER: Joel Toppen&#10;MAP and CARD ART: Chechu Nieto&#10;COUNTER ART: Chechu Nieto &amp; Xavier Carrascosa&#10;&#10;The first edition does not include a bot to play the Government faction.

365	135382	Shadowrun: Crossfire	The shadows of the Sixth World have every kind of danger you can imagine: ultra-violent gangers, flesh-eating ghouls, mages that summon spirits from toxic waste, backstabbing corporate raiders, hard-nosed police officers, and even dragons. You don't have much &mdash; mainly your guts, your wits, and your friends &mdash; but maybe that's enough. Between you and your teammates, you can sling spells, hack the Matrix, talk a tiger out of his stripes, and bring down a charging ork from a hundred yards away. Will that be enough to face down the worst the mean streets can throw at you? You're about to find out.&#10;&#10;Shadowrun: Crossfire is a cooperative deck-building card game for two to four players set in the gritty, cyberpunk fantasy world of Shadowrun. Play a shadowrunner team and take on tough jobs such as protecting a client who's marked for death, shooting your way out of downtown when a run goes sour, or facing down a dragon. In each game you'll improve your deck with a mix of strategies, while earning Karma to give your character cyber upgrades, physical augmentations, magical initiations, weapons training and Edge.&#10;&#10;Shadowrun: Crossfire includes two obstacle decks, a black market deck, a crossfire event deck, mission sheets, role cards, runner cards, and upgrade stickers.&#10;&#10;	\N	1	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/y0nfrP1exlJeWbYEdmD9bA__original/img/XKI9_MNe0oqeblKUADHw9n9z4nk=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2060466.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/y0nfrP1exlJeWbYEdmD9bA__thumb/img/-OuMWt8vmQ3l5tPUUVwgvDQ0M78=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2060466.jpg
366	327	Loopin' Louie	In Loopin' Louie, a battery-powered motor placed in the center of the table rotates a boom with a little plastic plane. Four radial arms lead out to the players' barns and the chickens they're trying to protect. Each barn has a little lever, which is used to knock the rotating plane away from your chickens and hopefully into someone else's. When only one player has chickens remaining, he or she wins the game. Very silly and very addictive.&#10;&#10;Extremely similar versions of the game, but with different themes, are available.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/e9CWevSJC03NzLybnCKEVQ__original/img/FZ8ti8jTLQPuHuQHWDt0hE6YHDs=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic4025029.png	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/e9CWevSJC03NzLybnCKEVQ__thumb/img/vQZYNWt9xSZez7NCoMB5Lz9yBdY=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4025029.png
367	5737	Domaine	The king shall return... But before he does, the realm falls into anarchy and chaos. The lords of the kingdom struggle to improve their place and standing. New borders are drawn, and expanded through strength of arms and subtle maneuver. Each duke seeks to establish a claim over the most valuable parts of the kingdom before the king finally returns. In the dark of the Middle Ages, control of the land was the key to wealth and power. Can you control enough territory to become the most prestigious duke before the king&rsquo;s return?&#10;&#10;In Domaine, players form domaines by placing walls on the modular board to enclose territory. Completed domaines can then be expanded, even into your opponents'. Protect domaines by placing knights, which resist expansion.&#10;&#10;Actions are taken by playing cards that have a cost associated with them. Gain money by selling cards and controlling mines. Sold cards can be acquired by other players.&#10;&#10;Players score points based on the quantity and type of terrain enclosed in their domaines, as well as by controlling many mines of a single type. The winner is the first player to cross a specific point threshold or the player with the most points when the card deck runs out.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/9OCBvjQKVfNattSqBy4k1Q__original/img/Z4BHJ1OVovYSNeLgJvOkT1GYVJQ=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic21368.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/9OCBvjQKVfNattSqBy4k1Q__thumb/img/jB1stUC9_7i5MwBhadEXIVTBbpw=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic21368.jpg
373	278	Catan Card Game	Catan Card Game bears only a slight resemblance to The Settlers of Catan, the original game in the Catan series.  There are six resources: wool, wood, bricks, grain, ore, and gold. Before beginning the game, the players receive six square cards showing the resources, with a different die number on each card. In addition, the players start the game with two village cards and a road card connecting them. There are card stacks of more roads and villages, as well as cities, to be purchased during the game. With each new village or city comes two new resource cards. Villages and cities give victory points.&#10;&#10;When the number die is rolled, instead of collecting more cards, the players rotate the corresponding card 90 degrees to indicate a gain of one more of that resource; i.e., the brick card shows a picture of one brick on one edge of the card, two bricks on the next clockwise edge, three bricks along the third edge, and zero bricks on the fourth edge. There is also an event die, with five possible outcomes:&#10;&#10;&#10;     a reward for the player with more knight points or more 'windmill' points (a picture of a windmill on some cards),&#10;     a bonus resource,&#10;     an attack if a player has too many resources, and&#10;     one of six special events - civil war, conflict, master builder, plague, productive year, or progress.     &#10;&#10;&#10;There are 62 expansion cards in six stacks in the center of the table. Before beginning the game, players choose one stack, go through it, and choose three cards to hold in their hands. Forty-two of the expansion cards require spending resources to be put into play, gaining civic improvements or knights. Every civic improvement serves some useful function or adds victory points or both. Twenty of the cards are actions benefiting one of the players or harming the other. After a player pays to put a card down or uses an action card, he blindly draws a replacement. Unwanted or unusable cards can be traded in future turns. Some of the cards have flags on them, indicating victory points.&#10;&#10;Whoever first has twelve victory points wins the game!&#10;&#10;The Anniversary edition of this game (Jubil&auml;umsausgabe, tin box edition) can be found under a separate game entry due to some differences in content: Die Siedler von Catan: Das Kartenspiel &#226;&#128;&#147; 10th Anniversary Special Edition Tin Box.&#10;&#10;Belongs to the Catan Series.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	2	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/CRCOv0p4FgZaze_3fGuhIA__original/img/OiugGzMENFVOzMTKBFZnEVOPzto=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic706443.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/CRCOv0p4FgZaze_3fGuhIA__thumb/img/m3u-LAThaaVm0fBYatEMsbrl_bk=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic706443.jpg

375	145371	Three Kingdoms Redux	The Han Dynasty, founded in 206 BC, ruled the central plains and much of modern day China for nearly four hundred years. However, by late second century, court politics and poor governance has left it in rapid decline. The government was dominated by corrupt eunuchs and officials who levied heavy taxes on the peasants, resulting in public discontent. This culminated in the Yellow Turban Rebellion led by Zhang Jiao in 184 AD during the reign of Emperor Ling (168-189 AD).&#10;&#10;Although the Yellow Turban Rebellion was eventually put down, many surviving followers went on to become bandits and continued to create problems for the government. The Han army was unable to control the bandits and Emperor Ling granted direct administrative power over provinces and command of regional military to local lords. Many feudal lords took the opportunity to sever ties with the Han government and ruled independently. The more ambitious lords annexed neighboring territories to expand their power bases. This led to the emergence of the three power blocs of Wei, Wu and Shu, and ushered in the Three Kingdoms period.&#10;&#10;Three Kingdoms Redux is a board game that seeks to recreate the tripartite between the states of Wei, Wu and Shu. You assume the role of one of the three lords &ndash; Cao Cao leading Cao Wei, Sun Jian leading Eastern Wu or Liu Bei leading Shu Han. Players start the game from asymmetrical positions, reflecting the manpower advantages Wei enjoyed in the early part of the period. The weaker states of Wu and Shu protect themselves by forming an alliance. As a feudal lord, you manage the different aspects of running a state whilst guarding your borders against both rebellious border tribes and external enemies. Managing each aspect well earns victory points for your state. But beware, for the balance of power shifts constantly during the game. Understand and take advantage of the power shifts, and you will fulfill your grand ambition of re-unifying China!&#10;&#10;In more detail, Three Kingdoms Redux is played over a number of rounds, up to a maximum of twelve. Players bid for various actions with their general tokens. The highest bidder of each action space obtains the right to carry out the actions.&#10;&#10;These actions allow players to improve your state&rsquo;s domestic development, gain military strength, construct state enhancements, increase popularity with your people, improve relationships with border tribes and gain promotion for the lord, to the next higher rank.&#10;&#10;The actions available to each player are: &#10;&#10;     develop your state&rsquo;s farm or marketplace, &#10;     recruit or train army units, &#10;     produce weapons, &#10;     trade resources, &#10;     construct state enhancements,  &#10;     control the Han emperor, &#10;     demand tributes from your vassals, &#10;     win support from your people, &#10;     import technology, &#10;     improve your relationship with your border tribe, or &#10;     wage battle against other states to expand your borders.&#10;&#10;&#10;The winner is the player with the most victory points (VPs) at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;	\N	3	3	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/YrOY2Id05RPDUyCe0EdNxw__original/img/gkwBxQymju0-xHXn6uvdmgTC6-Q=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1981282.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/YrOY2Id05RPDUyCe0EdNxw__thumb/img/SvOlTLv7XwRIqCcUvf7xSbbP2Ms=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1981282.jpg
376	71671	Yggdrasil	Yggdrasil is a co-operative game in which players are different gods of the Norse mythology: Odin, Thor, Tyr, Frey, Heimdall and Freyja.

Together the players have to resist to the impending coming of the Evil forces in Asgard, the gods' world.&#10;&#10;Game flow&#10;During his turn, the active player first draws an Enemy card, corresponding to one of the six Evil creatures. The corresponding counter is moved one space forward in Asgard and the associated effect applies. Then the active player performs three different actions among the nine at his disposal in order to resist to the advance:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Ask for the Elves' help&#10;    Get (or improve) a Weapon from the Dwarves&#10;    Send the Valkyries looking for Vikings' souls on the mankind world of Midgard&#10;    Fight the Fire Giants and try to gather the parts of a magic rune&#10;    Negotiate with the Vanir&#10;    Get rid of the Fire Giants who invade Midgard&#10;    Get the Vikings back from Hel's world&#10;    Exchange forces with another god&#10;    Fight against the Enemies in Asgard&#10;&#10;&#10;Each player, depending on the god he plays, has a specific power that allows him to perform some actions better. All of these actions have to be used at the right moment or the victory will be unreachable. The players will need cleverness, calm, and team spirit to challenge the game.&#10;&#10;	\N	1	6	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ZXSzvS1pL0qUoOPG6OzoAQ__original/img/5UytqB4ECzcsU9Y5mddEF2DKb9w=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4314491.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ZXSzvS1pL0qUoOPG6OzoAQ__thumb/img/NWUiczjWlEXPJcwNDlwE2qkDFng=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4314491.jpg

Next, B will share both his information and A's information to C while D talks to A.&#10;&#10;After two more rounds of the most inefficient crime-solving system ever created, players read the conclusion of the case, which might offer additional information or another visual, then they each individually answer three questions about the case, with the group scoring one point for each correct answer for a final score ranging from 0 to 12.&#10;&#10;	\N	4	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/E-432DX7M9-UJpFO88uJ6w__original/img/1EbX-Sm44IJZ1XUXqVOs4mjndpo=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2336025.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/E-432DX7M9-UJpFO88uJ6w__thumb/img/5FX8yNyKO898-jHjxI5JviBHTpE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2336025.jpg

Players are lords and ladies of noble houses seeking new lands and opportunities for fame and fortune.&#10;&#10;One game of Honshu lasts twelve rounds, and each round is divided into two phases. First, map cards are played in a trick, and the player who played the highest valued card gets to pick first from those cards played. Then the players use the map cards picked to expand their personal maps. Each player must expand their personal maps to maximize their scoring possibilities.&#10;&#10;Manipulating your position in the player order is crucial for mastering Honshu.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	5	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/eqDAlJIqk1rjnoY0MDR5-w__original/img/hT1fCJW8HxRyZxtyg68Qz4PRTCg=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3627583.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/eqDAlJIqk1rjnoY0MDR5-w__thumb/img/9DSDZqnYzElelWfO4beAwFbuzHc=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3627583.jpg
383	173090	The Game	Players in The Game try to discard all 98 cards in the deck onto four discard piles in order to win, but they need to do so in the right ways.&#10;&#10;Each player starts with 6-8 cards in their hand depending on the number of players, and four discard pile prompt cards are on the table: two showing &quot;1&quot; and an up arrow and two showing &quot;100&quot; and a down arrow. On a turn, a player must discard at least two cards from their hand onto one or more discard piles, with cards on the 1 piles being placed in ascending order and cards on the 100 piles being placed in descending order. One tricky aspect of the game is that you can play a card exactly 10 higher/lower than the top card of a discard pile even when you would normally have to play in a descending/ascending order, e.g., if a 100 discard pile is topped with an 87, you can play any card lower than 87 or you can play the 97.&#10;&#10;After a player finishes their turn, they refill their hand from the deck. During play, players cannot reveal exact numbers in their hands, but they can warn others not to play on certain discard piles or otherwise make play suggestions.&#10;&#10;Once the deck is emptied, players are required only to play at least one card on a turn. If you play all 98 cards, you win! If you get good, the rules suggest that you play at least three cards a turn to increase the challenge.&#10;&#10;	\N	1	5	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/g4pn1ieUKfIhERl5Ym6joQ__original/img/ZcwvBXraym0wfre1sm9t1d44BBA=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic4203279.png	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/g4pn1ieUKfIhERl5Ym6joQ__thumb/img/IRLfNA-yFg0etLOeNFp7QKFsea4=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4203279.png

386	232918	Fallout	Fallout is a post-nuclear adventure board game for one to four players. Based on the hit video game series by Bethesda Softworks, each Fallout scenario is inspired by a familiar story from the franchise. Survivors begin the game on the edge of an unexplored landscape, uncertain of what awaits them in this unfamiliar world. With just one objective to guide them from the very beginning, each player must explore the hidden map, fight ferocious enemies, and build the skills of their survivor as they attempt to complete challenging quests and balance feuding factions within the game.&#10;&#10;As they advance their survivors' stories, players come across new quests and individual targets, leading them to gain influence. Who comes out ahead depends on how keenly and aggressively each player ventures through the game; however, if a single faction is pushed to power too quickly, the wasteland will be taken for their own, and the survivors conquered along with it.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;	\N	1	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/9gjrMWDqLCBb-G0AYbKuSQ__original/img/t5RBBMPvLBa4_vEbK7ZrNbD8IdY=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3728149.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/9gjrMWDqLCBb-G0AYbKuSQ__thumb/img/Idbk30GnVx4RDeZrsUgTXe2RZHs=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3728149.jpg

It was released at Spiel '09 in Essen, Germany.&#10;&#10;Each player owns a factory and tries to earn the most money during the game. To be successful, each player must use his workers to buy the best machines and robots at the market and to run the machines most effectively in his factory. Because of increasing energy prices, the players must be careful to check the energy consumption of their factories and to avoid using only energy-consuming machines.

389	281549	Beast	Welcome to the Northern Expanse, a place where nature is still unexplored, mystical and dangerous. When the humans first arrived, they thought they found an unspoiled paradise, filled with bountiful forests, lakes swimming with fish and cold freshwater flowing from the mountains. But as their settlements expanded and the surrounding forests grew thinner, nature itself pushed back. Great creatures known as Beasts emerged, and with their fangs, claws and mystical powers, they proved an incredible threat to the humans. In order to protect the settlements, humans enlisted specialised hunters, tasked with tracking and killing the Beasts before too many of their kin perish.&#10;&#10;The Beast uses a deck of direction cards to move over forests, swamps and caverns, using guile and deceit to hide its track from the hunters. However, whenever a hunter moves over a location where the Beast has previously been, a trail appears. Only when a hunter searches a location or the Beast itself attacks an unsuspecting target is the Beast's actual position revealed. More so, each hunter has but one chance of searching each round, making it a tense and difficult decision. Hunters seldom have full information whether the trail they&rsquo;re pursuing contains the Beast&rsquo;s actual location, or if the trail has already gone cold.&#10;&#10;Each action you perform in this game is done by playing a card from your hand (up to a maximum of two cards per turn). This means that if a player wants to search, attack or move, they need to have a card in their hand that lets them do that. Before each round, both hunters and Beast participate in a draft for the most important cards. All action cards can be used by both Beast and hunters alike.&#10;&#10;In order to win this game, you either need to cooperate every step of the way if you play as a hunter, or skillfully outmaneuver your opponents if you play as Beast. On their own, hunters are never stronger than the Beast. Only when hunters communicate, strategize and combine their actions can they bring down the Beast before it&rsquo;s too late.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/-9NLgO6ASOHgZtMtamqjxw__original/img/h0pnI_UvkAQfMPhQq-7dKzEcHlc=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic6418160.png	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/-9NLgO6ASOHgZtMtamqjxw__thumb/img/fCr4XXnWjrm7TBCL4Vf_VH7pHYA=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6418160.png

390	143884	Machi Koro	Welcome to the city of Machi Koro. You've just been elected Mayor. Congrats! Unfortunately the citizens have some pretty big demands: jobs, a theme park, a couple of cheese factories and maybe even a radio tower. A tough proposition since the city currently consists of a wheat field, a bakery and a single die.&#10;&#10;Armed only with your trusty die and a dream, you must grow Machi Koro into the largest city in the region. You will need to collect income from developments, build public works, and steal from your neighbors' coffers. Just make sure they aren't doing the same to you!&#10;&#10;Machi Koro is a fast-paced game for 2-4 players. Each player wants to develop the city on their own terms in order to complete all of the landmarks under construction faster than their rivals. On their turn, each player rolls one or two dice. If the sum of the dice rolled matches the number of a building that a player owns, they get the effect of that building; in some cases opponents will also benefit from your dice (just as you can benefit from theirs). Then, with money in hand a player can build a landmark or a new building, ideally adding to the wealth of their city on future turns. The first player to construct all of their landmarks wins!&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/_lI2eUDHfesfe5SswJiFAg__original/img/H4XHVffQ4SOxgWoG396I9LUrwg8=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic4783831.png	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/_lI2eUDHfesfe5SswJiFAg__thumb/img/tCTP0XMMmsAfNqzb0iYmp0b-YUc=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4783831.png
391	1634	Warhammer Quest	Warhammer Quest is the original game in the Warhammer Quest Series.&#10;&#10;From the Main Rulebook:&#10;&#10;In Warhammer Quest each player takes the role of a warrior, one of four brave adventurers willing to test their courage in the search for wealth and glory. Each hero comes from a different people. The Barbarian has traveled far from the savage north, a land of bitter cold and ferocious warriors. The Wizard hails from the cities of the Empire, the largest and most important of the realms of men. The Dwarf is drawn by the goldlust for which his race is famous. Dwarfs are grim and rather abrupt, but they are good fighters and loyal friends who remember debts of gratitude as readily as debts of coin. The Elf comes from the green woods of Loren where his kin spend their days hunting and making merry, protected from evil by the strange magic of their land. Elves are incredibly quick and agile, and they are also the best archers in the world.&#10;&#10;In the Warhammer Quest game the players enter a dark and forbidding dungeon. Together they must face the horrific dangers that wait for them. They will be attacked by monsters such as Orcs, Goblins, Skaven and Minotaurs. Other perils lurk in the darkness: scurrying venomous things like spiders, deadly pit traps, and decayed tunnels that cave in at the slightest touch. If they complete their quest the players will be rewarded with gold, treasure and artefacts of magical power. The more gold and treasure you can discover the better.., and the player whose warrior amasses the greatest fortune has done best of all!&#10;&#10;Warhammer Quest is probably unlike other games you have played. Rather than each player competing against the others, all the players must co-operate if they are to win. Also, there is no single board. Instead, the different rooms and corridor sections are clipped together to make a dungeon that is different every time you play. The game rules may seem a little complex at first - but don't worry a lot of the rules are designed to extend the game and are not vital to begin with. The actual game rules you need to play are in this book or printed on the various cards. The hugely thick Role-play Book is all extra and alternative material that introduces you to a whole new hobby of role-playing Warhammer Quest.&#10;&#10;- Warhammer Quest Contents -&#10;&#10;    4 Warrior models: Barbarian, Dwarf, Elf and Wizard&#10;    6 Orc Warrior models&#10;    6 Orc Archer models&#10;    6 Goblin Spearmen models&#10;    6 Night Goblin Archer models&#10;    12 Skaven models&#10;    3 Minotaur models&#10;    12 Giant Spider models&#10;    12 Giant Bat models&#10;    12 Giant Rat models&#10;    12 Snotling models&#10;    10 Dungeon Doorways&#10;    32 Page Rule Book&#10;    16 Page Adventure Book&#10;    192 Page Role-play Book&#10;    1 How to Play sheet&#10;    50 Page Adventure Record Pad&#10;    19 Event Cards&#10;    23 Dungeon Cards&#10;    30 Treasure Cards&#10;    17 Blank Event Cards&#10;    15 Spell Cards&#10;    4 Warrior Cards&#10;    4 Battle-level Cards&#10;    4 Equipment Cards&#10;    4 Warrior Counters&#10;    6 Dungeon Rooms&#10;    5 Objective Rooms&#10;    7 Corridors&#10;    1 Steps&#10;    3 T-junctions&#10;    1 Corner&#10;    1 Portcullis Marker&#10;    1 Cave-in Marker&#10;    3 Pit of Despair Markers&#10;    6 Webbed Counters&#10;    15 Power Tokens&#10;    10 Luck Counters&#10;    24 plastic shields&#10;    18 Scenery Markers&#10;    6 Large Dice &amp; 12 Small Dice&#10;&#10;&#10;	\N	1	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/R_AD0CQfaLhXx_KNHssXow__original/img/tDgTVmzjRvw2mMmIr9q9UcteJJg=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic355859.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/R_AD0CQfaLhXx_KNHssXow__thumb/img/_9pxjeCwEI1_e8ZNdM5b7SJgxDM=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic355859.jpg

393	197070	Massive Darkness	Massive Darkness brings the classic fantasy RPG experience to modern board gaming, with an action-packed campaign chock full of gorgeous miniatures and a streamlined system that keeps the focus on the heroes' actions, with no need for a game master to control the enemies.&#10;&#10;Using the popular Zombicide system as a starting point, Massive Darkness adds all the richness of a dungeon crawl RPG. Pick your hero, choose a class, decide on which skills to spend your XP, and get loot by searching the dungeon or killing special enemies that can use the equipment against you! Face a multitude of different enemy types, coming in all shapes and sizes, whose behavior is resolved automatically...or you can try to sneak around enemies by taking advantage of dark areas of the map.&#10;&#10;Players begin their adventure in Massive Darkness by picking a Hero &ndash; each with two special starting skills &ndash; and pair them with a Class of their choosing. Depending on the combination, another skill can be unlocked, giving players a wide range of choices and play styles. In Massive Darkness, the created Heroes go on Quests, killing monsters, collecting loot, and gaining XP. Players spend their XP to unlock new Skills, growing more powerful as the Quest progresses.&#10;&#10;Throughout the game, players encounter different monsters, including Minions, Agents, Roaming Monsters, and Bosses. An unique mechanism of the game is the Guardian. Any of the monster types have a chance of spawning as a Guardian, meaning it will use a random piece of equipment in the fight against Heroes. However, if players are able to overcome this difficult encounter, they will acquire that piece of loot!&#10;&#10;	\N	1	6	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/4gH_fX2BQPViWLe9pNfSKg__original/img/_bA6dQIzEddE6_i_N7U5zP6ZZ1g=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3687923.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/4gH_fX2BQPViWLe9pNfSKg__thumb/img/dmONbeBrevbppd5nZ7J1bCGvmzg=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3687923.jpg

Napoleon, emperor of France, is seeking to dominate Europe through conquest. France&rsquo;s enemies, led by England, are engaged in a desperate struggle to defeat Napoleon. England, in dire need of men, is impressing men to serve in its navy. Included are Americans who are pressed into service at gunpoint.&#10;&#10;The young American nation objects. Eager to defend its sovereign rights and to strengthen its position in North America, the United States declares war on Britain on June 18, 1812. Taking advantage of the British Army being occupied in its struggles against Napoleon, American forces invade Canada in order to drive the British from its last remaining colony on North American soil. Surprised, Britain reels from the attack and now has to face another enemy threat on another front.&#10;&#10;In 1812 - The Invasion of Canada, players take on one of the roles of the major factions that took part in the War of 1812. On the British side these are represented by the British Regulars (Redcoats), Canadian Militia and Native Americans; and the American Regular Army and American Militia comprise the American players. Players for each side will cooperate with each other in order to plan and conduct their campaigns. Each side will attempt to capture Objective Areas on the map. When a truce is called, the side that controls the most enemy Objective Areas wins.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	5	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/X9d9aA-5vMk2QPX3LPUenQ__original/img/oGuX_HKtaKcJYs6JujCN9Unoshs=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1107292.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/X9d9aA-5vMk2QPX3LPUenQ__thumb/img/kaCwct3z6KPyxJSXsdGmaODksfA=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1107292.jpg
396	104020	Vanuatu	In Vanuatu, you are a Vanuatuan who wants to prosper during the eight turns of the game. In order to prosper, you have to manage with natural resources, rare items, vatus (local currency) and tourists. To earn money or prosperity points, you may also draw on the sand*, carry tourists all over Vanuatu islands, or trade cargo with foreign countries.&#10; On each turn, the archipelago expands and you have to program your actions with five tokens. You put one or more of them on the chosen action spaces, and on your turn, you will only be able to play an action if you have the majority on its space. Thus, sometimes have to wait for other players to remove their tokens by playing their actions. If you are not in majority anywhere, you have to remove all of your tokens from an action and give up hope of playing this action. A good strategy lets you block other players; for example, they won't be able to sell fishes if they haven't caught them first &ndash; order matters! Islands and sea resources are rare, so be quick and take them first!&#10;&#10;There is no such thing as a rich Vanuatuan. When you reach ten vatus, they automatically transform into 5 prosperity points and again, you are poor. Life is hard, but you may encounter ten men to help you; on each turn you choose one of them to increase your benefits from an action. As always, being the first player lets you choose before the others.&#10;&#10;In short, Vanuatu is a strategy game of programming and majorities that features development, blocking, and a lot of interaction between players.&#10;&#10;(*) Sand Drawing in Vanuatu belongs to the Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity of the UNESCO.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	5	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/1ozE0RuBxHf-WpJctDZBRw__original/img/weK6_HFcc18b6wIf9bfOG3notCw=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1288264.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/1ozE0RuBxHf-WpJctDZBRw__thumb/img/d7ZqhcCCpJMzvtjM_Axl8NvmW1I=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1288264.jpg
397	67492	Battles of Westeros	Unfurl the banners of the Great Houses of Westeros! To secure power in the Seven Kingdoms and to ensure the survival of their lines, the Houses of Westeros each follow very different paths. Some forge strategic alliances, some create complex political intrigues, and still others use deceit and betrayal. But there is no more direct or lasting path to power than taking to the field of battle.&#10;&#10;In Battles of Westeros, two players recreate the military conflicts set in George R.R. Martin&rsquo;s A Song of Ice and Fire series, taking part in battles directly from the books... or designing their own. In this epic board game of battlefield tactics, players control either House Stark, the wards of Winterfell who have called their hearty allies to defend their honor and lands, or House Lannister, an aggressive force funded by Casterly Rock&rsquo;s endless supply of gold.&#10;&#10;Battles of Westeros is played over a series of included scenarios, called battles. Each of these has a battle plan that dictates the formation of the map (called the battlefield), starting positions of each House&rsquo;s units, starting resources, special rules, and victory conditions for the game session. A battle is played over several rounds, with each round consisting of alternating player turns. The goals a player needs to accomplish to win a game of Battles of Westeros can vary (some battles require players to earn a certain number of victory points, while other battles require a player to take and hold strategic positions on the battlefield), but this collection of available scenarios, along with the ability to make your own exciting battles with the double-sided map board and over thirty map overlays, gives Battles of Westeros a wealth of replayability!&#10;&#10;Battles of Westeros also offers plenty of strategic complexity, resulting in a satisfying number of compelling choices in every game. For example, each player has a special randomized Leadership Deck, consisting of unique tactics and abilities; this deck will change based on the scenario being played and characters present. Is Jaime Lannister on the battlefield? If you draw the appropriate Leadership Card, he can order nearby troops to aggressively rush their opponents! Is Eddard Stark guiding his forces into battle? Special flanking maneuvers enter your Leadership Deck, to potentially be drawn into your hand.&#10;&#10;Battles of Westeros also features a level of realism that immerses you in the most significant conflicts of the War of the Five Kings. Each plastic figure base, which holds your infantry, archer, cavalry, and kennelmaster units, has a slot for a banner pole &ndash; a small flag-bearing attachment. The plastic banners that attach to each unit bear the crest of that unit&rsquo;s house, and their orientation on the pole indicates at a glance whether that unit has been ordered yet. In addition to the intuitive and useful game effect this provides (differentiating the units you&rsquo;ve activated from those you haven&rsquo;t), the sight of your army&rsquo;s banners spread impressively across the gorgeously designed game board will give you the sense that you are the clever Tywin Lannister, Lord of Casterly Rock... or the stoic Robb Stark, with his direwolf Grey Wind at his side!&#10;&#10;	\N	2	2	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/8THvj65P8JTqfvreVioXkg__original/img/gBzzcu-31LExLYWouT-ZGDElNjI=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic711013.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/8THvj65P8JTqfvreVioXkg__thumb/img/sWtsIamGadaRV1t4_fBPSHChilk=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic711013.jpg

399	154246	La Isla	Ready to start exploring a previously uncharted island? Good! You and the other players each have a team of five scientists, and you want to capture animal species so that you can study them &mdash; and, of course, score points.&#10;&#10;The game board in La Isla consists of a set of oddly-shaped tiles that are placed in a circular arrangement around a central polygonal tile. Thirty-five animal tokens (seven each of five types) are placed at random on spaces numbered 2, 3 and 4 on the game board; these numbers equal the number of camps that surround these spaces.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player has three cards that he places face-down in the A, B and D spaces on his card display. All players reveal their A cards at the same time, then place them in one of the three slots at the top of their display; the image depicted on the top of this card shows the special power that the owner of this card has available. Once a player has filled all three slots on her display, future cards placed with the A action cover an existing card.&#10;&#10;After revealing the cards in their B slots simultaneously, the players collect the goods depicted in the lower-left corner of their individual card.&#10;&#10;Each player in turn then places one of his scientists on a camp, first paying two resources of the type matching that camp. (If all of a player's scientists are on the board, she moves one of these scientists.) If the player now has a scientist on each camp surrounding an animal space, she takes that animal tile, scoring points for it as noted on the board (4, 3 or 2 points).&#10;&#10;Finally, the card in the D slot increases the value of one animal. You (and only you!) immediately score one point per animal of the type you moved up on the scale. If you don't have an animal of that type you don't get any points. Each animal has a points threshold so that if you move an animal up, say, four times, each animal of this type is worth an extra point at the end of the game. The scale goes up to five so that every animal can be worth up five points at the end of the game. When the sum of these values for all five animals equals seven, nine or eleven (based on the number of players), the game ends at the conclusion of the round. Players then tally their final scores to see who wins.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/NR5VdEHv-LilFS3UKG82wg__original/img/PU2IpbxX8KGs_sIV5IoBW6jfIS4=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2073938.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/NR5VdEHv-LilFS3UKG82wg__thumb/img/PO7_SuSMn-k1xOVj4resJoonmnA=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2073938.jpg
429	295486	My City	My City is a competitive legacy game in which you develop a city on your own playing board through the ages.&#10;&#10;The game consists of 24 episodes, beginning with the development of a city in its early preindustrial stages and progressing through industrialization. During each game, players customize their experience by adding elements to their personal boards and adding cards to the game. Players' choices and action made during one session of gameplay carry over into the next session, creating a personalized gaming experience.&#10;&#10;For players who do not want to experience My City as a legacy game, a double-sided game board offers an alternate set-up for repeatable play (some elements from the legacy experience are needed for the repeatable play game, players can unlock these elements by playing through the first 4 episodes).&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/fz4aYmycg9baQlm_DzwyKA__original/img/TvWwknCLoPNxx3uIOhlCg-9F1mM=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic7443423.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/fz4aYmycg9baQlm_DzwyKA__thumb/img/j66PBN_vi0zLs7c-zR-r2NkUT2g=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7443423.jpg
401	68264	No Retreat! The Russian Front	(from GMT's website:)&#10;&#10;No Retreat: The Russian Front is a new deluxe edition of the  two-player Victory Point Games 2008 CSR Award Nominee wargame that retells the story of the titanic struggle between the invading armies of Nazi Germany versus Communist Russia during WW2 at a player-friendly and manageable level of scope and difficulty.  This edition combines both the original game and its two extensions (Na Berlin! and No Surrender!) using deluxe components of &ldquo;Twilight Struggle Deluxe Edition&rdquo; quality. With only 40 Army/Front sized counters for the Tournament game, and 70 for the whole campaign, and with very low stacking, it&rsquo;s a quick-playing yet realistic affair that favours the strategic and offensive-minded player.&#10;&#10;Each turn is alight with intriguing on-board challenges plus the surprise of card hand Events as players vie to win in one of three different ways.&#10;&#10;In a skillfully blended collation of classic hex-based wargaming and modern card-driven simulations, No Retreat: The Russian Front  stays truly story-centric, providing the proper feel of sweeping maneuvers, exploitation and encirclements across the vast steppes and forests of Russia. With a simple-yet-innovative economic model, players will also feel the growing might and sophistication of the Russian&rsquo;s Red Army, and the degradation of the once-invincible German Wehrmacht, over the epic four year sweep of time that this merciless campaign was fought.&#10;&#10;Neither side can afford the disgrace of yielding an inch of ground to their hated foe, so your orders are: &ldquo;No Retreat!&rdquo;&#10;&#10;Components:&#10;&#10;     One Standard size mounted map&#10;     Two Counter Sheets&#10;     One deck of 55 Playing Cards&#10;     Rule booklet&#10;     Scenario booklet&#10;     Player Aid Cards&#10;     Two 6-sided dice (1 black and 1 white)&#10;&#10;&#10;TIME SCALE: 2 months per turn&#10;MAP SCALE: 100km / 60 miles per hex&#10;UNIT SCALE: Armies and Fronts&#10;NUMBER OF PLAYERS: 2&#10;&#10;DESIGNER: Carl Paradis&#10;DEVELOPER: Alan Emrich &amp; Carl Paradis&#10;COUNTER ART: Mark Simonitch &amp; Carl Paradis&#10;MAP ART: Mark Simonitch&#10;&#10;	\N	2	2	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/TTQllPzYNV0MoHmrsytv4w__original/img/v_ajKD6dHClACSunFRftmNMWHqw=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1019831.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/TTQllPzYNV0MoHmrsytv4w__thumb/img/Zjt90vMaHg9WN6vNijmhz1d2HwY=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1019831.jpg
402	314491	Meadow	Meadow is an engaging set collection game with over two hundred unique cards containing hand-painted watercolor illustrations. In the game, players take the role of explorers competing for the title of the most skilled nature observer. To win, they collect cards with the most valuable species, landscapes, and discoveries. Their journey is led by passion, a curiosity of the world, an inquiring mind, and a desire to discover the mysteries of nature. The competition continues at the bonfire where the players race to fulfill the goals of their adventures.&#10;&#10;In this medium-weight board game for 1-4 players, you take turns placing path tokens on one of the two boards. Placing a token on the main board allows the player to get cards, but playing them requires meeting certain requirements. Playing a token on the bonfire board activates special actions (which helps to implement a chosen strategy) and gives the opportunity to achieve goals that provide additional points. Throughout the game, players collect cards in their meadow and surroundings area. At the end, the player with the most points on cards and on the bonfire board wins.&#10;&#10;Meadow also includes envelopes with additional cards to open at specific moments...&#10;&#10;	\N	1	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/9r3qdPijtgoIN24PxFU2gw__original/img/tHQTKwwk4N8J5fpWhsoE8t0FQhw=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5894745.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/9r3qdPijtgoIN24PxFU2gw__thumb/img/tugW5aKyC6Vs31QaBX8YvmQiPTQ=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5894745.jpg
403	171131	Captain Sonar	At the bottom of the ocean, no one will hear you scream!&#10;&#10;In Captain Sonar, you and your teammates control a state-of-the-art submarine and are trying to locate an enemy submarine in order to blow it out of the water before they can do the same to you. Every role is important, and the confrontation is merciless. Be organized and communicate because a captain is nothing without his crew: the Chief Mate, the Radio Operator, and the Engineer.&#10;&#10;All the members of a team sit on one side of the table, and they each take a particular role on the submarine, with the division of labor for these roles being dependent on the number of players in the game: One player might be the captain, who is responsible for moving the submarine and announcing some details of this movement; another player is manning the sonar in order to listen to the opposing captain's orders and try to decipher where that sub might be in the water; a third player might be working in the munitions room to prepare torpedoes, mines and other devices that will allow for combat.&#10;&#10;Captain Sonar can be played in two modes: turn-by-turn or simultaneous. In the latter set-up, all the members of a team take their actions simultaneously while trying to track what the opponents are doing, too. When a captain is ready to launch an attack, the action pauses for a moment to see whether a hit has been recorded &mdash; then play resumes with the target having snuck away while the attacker paused or with bits of metal now scattered across the ocean floor.&#10;&#10;Multiple maps are included with varying levels of difficulty.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	8	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Dpu5nFJu4UUJ4Y50WyKueg__original/img/feQTYcCwgIg4LneCYIoaWz12Z24=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic7069368.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Dpu5nFJu4UUJ4Y50WyKueg__thumb/img/tRPNrLtteyfINpaFLLqEjyfTA10=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7069368.jpg
404	242302	Space Base	In Space Base, players assume the roles of Commodores of a small fleet of ships. Ships begin docked at their stations and are then deployed to sectors as new ships are commissioned under your command. Use cargo vessels to engage in trade and commerce; mining vessels to build reoccurring base income; and carriers to spread your influence. Establish new colonies for a new Commodore in a sector to gain even more influence. Gain enough influence and you can be promoted to Admiral!&#10;&#10;Space Base is a quick-to-learn, quick-to-play dice game using the core &quot;I roll, everyone gets stuff&quot; mechanism seen in other games. It's also a strategic engine builder using a player board (your space base) and tableaus of ship cards you can buy and add to your board. The cards you buy and the order you buy them in have interesting implications on your engine beyond just the ability on the card you buy, making for a different type of engine construction than seen in similar games. Players can take their engine in a number of directions: long odds and explosive gains, low luck and steady income, big end-game combos to launch from last to first, or a mix-and-match approach. Ultimately, Space Base is a game you can just start playing and teach everyone how to play in the first round or two and has a satisfying blend of dice-chucking luck and challenging strategic choices.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	5	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/MHhQxXVjiaa6C-04nGiIWw__original/img/QyWen0FVOKD_4wf7Na7fdsMTjis=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic6640638.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/MHhQxXVjiaa6C-04nGiIWw__thumb/img/rgETRyeuYs_wiZ5y-9Zj5H8kyFo=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6640638.jpg
405	188	Go	By all appearances, it's just two players taking turns laying stones on a 19&times;19 (or smaller) grid of intersections.  But once its basic rules are understood, Go shows its staggering depth. One can see why many people say it's one of the most elegant brain-burning abstract games in history, with players trying to claim territory by walling off sections of the board and surrounding each other's stones.  The game doesn't end until the board fills up, or, more often, when both players agree to end it, at which time whoever controls the most territory wins.&#10;&#10;The earliest mention of Go (&#229;&#156;&#141;&#230;&#163;&#139; (w&eacute;i q&iacute;)- &quot;surrounding game&quot;) appears in the &quot;Analects&quot; of Confucius (551-479 BC), while the earliest physical evidence is a 17&times;17 Go board discovered in 1952 in a tomb of the former Han dynasty (206 BC- 9 AD). There is a tangle of conflicting popular and scholarly anecdotes attributing its invention to two Chinese emperors, an imperial vassal and court astrologers. One story has it that Go was invented by the legendary Emperor Yao (ruled 2357-2256 BC) as an amusement for his idiot son. A second claims that the Emperor Shun (ruled 2255-2205 BC) created the game in hopes of improving his weak-minded son's mental prowess. A third says the person named Wu, a vassal of the Emperor Jie (ruled 1818-1766 BC), invented Go (as well as games of cards). Finally, a fourth story suggests that Go was developed by court astrologers during the Zhou dynasty (1045-255 BC).&#10;&#10;A Go set, consisting of a very general-purpose grid and colored stones, can also be used to play a variety of other abstract strategy games, such as Connect6, Go-Moku, and Pente.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	2	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/6qAiZwWxSSKP2kFcA80cZg__original/img/oClfNpLGqRwyqeq54Na_VoVAA3o=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1728832.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/6qAiZwWxSSKP2kFcA80cZg__thumb/img/COT5I3D_0dKWrSRHChb-SnQl3Zc=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1728832.jpg
407	104006	Village	Life in the village is hard &ndash; but life here also allows the inhabitants to grow and prosper as they please. One villager might want to become a friar. Another might feel ambitious and strive for a career in public office. A third one might want to seek his luck in distant lands.&#10;&#10;Each player will take the reins of a family and have them find fame and glory in many different ways. There is one thing you must not forget, however: Time will not stop for anyone and with time people will vanish. Those who will find themselves immortalized in the village chronicles will bring honor to their family and be one step closer to victory.&#10;&#10;Village is a game full of tactical challenges. A smart and unique new action mechanism is responsible for keeping turns short and yet still tactically rich and full of difficult decisions. Also unique is the way this game deals with the delicate subject of death; as a natural and perpetual part of life in the village, thoughts of death will keep you focused on smart time-management.&#10;&#10;Paraphrased from Opinionated Gamer's review:&#10;&#10;Each player&rsquo;s turn consists of taking a cube and then taking the action of the area they just took the cube from.  The board has multiple different zones with specific attributes, a market, a travel zone, a crafting zone, a church, and a council house.  Many of these offer multiple options, so even if you take a cube from the crafting area, you can get an ox, a horse, a cart, a plow, a scroll, or convert wheat to gold.  Each zone is seeded with cubes of four colors plus black cubes which serve as curses, there are lots of turns per round. Some areas offer short-term scoring, others offer long-term scoring, and still others offer only end-game scoring. The round ends when there are no cubes at any location.  The game ends when either the village chronicle or the anonymous graveyard is full.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/5FBIAvZi3Sw8dvmfwwJTjg__original/img/HZYRVZoUtl7COYnS0NvXNSuaf80=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2760568.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/5FBIAvZi3Sw8dvmfwwJTjg__thumb/img/5H-bOQSAtO8LaWI3i3_oG3CQHHg=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2760568.jpg
408	322289	Darwin's Journey	When all you can identify in the horizon for many long days is the line that detaches the sea from the sky, the glimpse of a distant shore appearing before you will make you shiver at the understanding that the adventure is about to begin.&#10;&#10;You find yourself astonished, landing on the shore that will be the origin of an extensive exploration through the Galapagos, a magic place of inconceivable beauty and endless biodiversity. There, you will gather repertoires and expand your knowledge of the natural sciences. Your eyes will learn how to detect the hidden species in the tropical forest, gazing at the countless colors and textures of nature. After inspiring hours spent studying and getting to enlightening conclusions, you will rest under a sparkling sky, admiring the stunning complexity of the animal realm.&#10;&#10;Darwin's Journey is a worker-placement Eurogame in which players recall Charles Darwin's memories of his adventure through the Galapagos islands, which contributed to the development of his theory of evolution.&#10;&#10;With the game's innovative worker progression system, each worker will have to study the disciplines that are a prerequisite to perform several actions in the game, such as exploration, correspondence, gathering, and dispatch of repertoires found on the island to museums in order to contribute to the human knowledge of biology. The game lasts five rounds, and thanks to several short- and long-term objectives, every action you take will grant victory points in different ways.&#10;&#10;	\N	1	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/-A_ABjMw4PdoAZrH-FjiiA__original/img/GuDlOog3eTRrkxCUzCEgRc17B-g=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic5726930.png	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/-A_ABjMw4PdoAZrH-FjiiA__thumb/img/_rJRtHzqatLg9OQM0x1UaC1cRGY=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5726930.png

Now you need to save humanity through space colonization...&#10;&#10;Welcome to the Moon uses the same flip-and-write game mechanisms as the earlier title Welcome To..., but now you can play in a campaign across eight adventure sheets. On a turn, you flip cards from three stacks to create three different combinations of a starship number and a corresponding action, then all players choose one of these three combinations. You use the number to fill a space in a zone on your adventure sheet in numerical order, and everyone is racing to be the first to complete common missions.&#10;&#10;The eight adventure sheets feature very different mechanisms from the classic Welcome To... concept, and when you play in campaign mode, you'll make choices that change the next adventure, which means that each campaign will differ from the previous one.&#10;&#10;	\N	1	6	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/eCdiHCB9OobumwaGl4dbOQ__original/img/U4DY7_OUE1XI1m1Fi0iubbf2sEI=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic6204967.png	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/eCdiHCB9OobumwaGl4dbOQ__thumb/img/dyaAIesMyeQWUoLRA25Dj9MhruI=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6204967.png
410	300531	Paleo	Paleo is a co-operative adventure game set in the stone age, a game in which players try to keep the human beings in their care alive while completing missions. Sometimes you need a fur, sometimes a tent, but these are all minor quests compared to your long-term goal: Painting a woolly mammoth on the wall so that humans thousands of years later will know that you once existed. (Okay, you just think the mammoth painting looks cool. Preserving a record of your past existence is gravy.)&#10;&#10;What might keep you from painting that mammoth? Death, in all its many forms.&#10;&#10;Each player starts the game with a couple of humans, who each have a skill and a number of life points. On a turn, each player chooses to go to one location &mdash; possibly of the same type as other players, although not the same location &mdash; and while you have some idea of what you might find there, you won't know for sure until you arrive, at which point you might acquire food or resources, or find what you need to craft a useful object, or discover that you can help someone else in their project, or suffer a snakebite that brings you close to death. Life is full of both wonders and terrors...&#10;&#10;At the day's end, you need food for all the people in your party as well as various crafts or skills that allow you to complete quests. Failure to do so adds another skull on the tote board, and once you collect enough of those, you decide that living is for fools and give up the ghost, declaring that future humans can just admire someone else, for all you care.&#10;&#10;Paleo includes multiple modules that allow for a variety of people, locations, quests, and much more during your time in 10,000 BCE.&#10;&#10;	\N	1	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/85t1wkwgvh3d2mmjsRcDrw__original/img/ejYTb1MVpf9optjLWlwbYua0TMk=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic6039256.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/85t1wkwgvh3d2mmjsRcDrw__thumb/img/K1IMVdd39Or51HpLAfiXz3JNUvI=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6039256.jpg
411	148228	Splendor	Splendor is a game of chip-collecting and card development. Players are merchants of the Renaissance trying to buy gem mines, means of transportation, shops&mdash;all in order to acquire the most prestige points. If you're wealthy enough, you might even receive a visit from a noble at some point, which of course will further increase your prestige.&#10;&#10;On your turn, you may (1) collect chips (gems), or (2) buy and build a card, or (3) reserve one card. If you collect chips, you take either three different kinds of chips or two chips of the same kind. If you buy a card, you pay its price in chips and add it to your playing area. To reserve a card&mdash;in order to make sure you get it, or, why not, your opponents don't get it&mdash;you place it in front of you face down for later building; this costs you a round, but you also get gold in the form of a joker chip, which you can use as any gem.&#10;&#10;All of the cards you buy increase your wealth as they give you a permanent gem bonus for later buys; some of the cards also give you prestige points. In order to win the game, you must reach 15 prestige points before your opponents do.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/rwOMxx4q5yuElIvo-1-OFw__original/img/Y2tUGY2nPTGd_epJYKQXPkQD8AM=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1904079.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/rwOMxx4q5yuElIvo-1-OFw__thumb/img/D4hkkHfOgu22PwgJomjplWAveuo=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1904079.jpg
412	258779	Planet Unknown	Our planet has run out of resources, and we are forced to move. We have discovered a series of planets and sent our rovers to test their environment with the hope of colonization. Our rovers have confirmed 1-6 viable colonization options.&#10;&#10;Planet Unknown is a competitive game for 1-6 players in which players attempt to develop the best planet. Each round, each player places one polyomino-shaped, dual-resource tile on their planet. Each resource represents the infrastructure needed to support life on the planet. Every tile placement is important to cover your planet efficiently and also to build up your planet's engine. After placing the tile, players do two actions associated with the two infrastructure types on the tile. Some tile placements trigger &quot;meteors&quot; that make all planets harder to develop and prevent them from scoring points in the meteor's row and column.&#10;&#10;Planet Unknown innovates on the popular polyomino trend by allowing simultaneous, yet strategic turn-based play via the Lazy S.U.S.A.N. space station in the center of the table.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;	\N	1	6	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/3HkjDovk8Yr2wMumcSUGog__original/img/hl_WEzG4mKaEW_7qrZf-sPxXMpI=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4843622.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/3HkjDovk8Yr2wMumcSUGog__thumb/img/4pF1oDpvn1VR3rbvW88xLK86xmA=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4843622.jpg
413	118	Modern Art	Buying and selling paintings can be a very lucrative business.  Five different artists have produced a bunch of paintings, and it's the player's task to be both the buyer and the seller, hopefully making a profit in both roles.  He does this by putting a painting from his hand up for auction each turn.  He gets the money if some other player buys it, but must pay the bank if he buys it for himself.  After each round, paintings are valued by the number of paintings of that type that were sold.  The broker with the most cash after four rounds is the winner.&#10;&#10;Part of the Knizia auction trilogy.&#10;&#10;	\N	3	5	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/wLto-xaabHwKQe_Bc4iD1Q__original/img/s3Gai8XBTVfWFFlYpL4XF3kIlWU=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic3458036.png	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/wLto-xaabHwKQe_Bc4iD1Q__thumb/img/AUqMholGVlwXLjMcxwiziE_7Ffw=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3458036.png
414	182631	Star Realms: Colony Wars	Colony Wars is a deckbuilding game in the Star Realms series which is both a standalone box set for two players (featuring an 80-card trade deck, as in the original) and an expansion for the base Star Realms set that allows it to be played as a four-player game.&#10;&#10;In Colony Wars, as in Star Realms, players will start with a fleet (deck) of 10 basic ships, and can spend Trade to acquire more powerful ships and bases from a central trade row of 5 cards. This row is continuously replenished by random draws from the trade deck. Many ships and bases deal Combat damage which you can use to attack your opponent and/or destroy their bases. When you reduce your opponent's Authority to zero, you win.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	2	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/FKEjArvFzBTpPJRvU34t8A__original/img/Ixujer_N-Ro0jFErjGdmCdo152k=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4324043.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/FKEjArvFzBTpPJRvU34t8A__thumb/img/v4xPFJ7qUbkc6f7Dpgsn21ZM5YQ=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4324043.jpg
415	215	Tichu	Tichu took much of its rules and mechanics from Zheng Fen. It is a partnership climbing card game, and the object of play is to rid yourself of your hand, preferably while scoring points in the process.&#10;&#10;The deck is a standard 52-card pack with four special cards added: dog, phoenix, dragon and Mah Jong (1). When it's your turn, you may either beat the current top card combination &mdash; single card, pair of cards, sequence of pairs, full house, etc. &mdash; or pass. If play passes all the way back to the player who laid the top cards, they win the trick, clears the cards, and can lead the next one. The card led determines the only combination of cards that can be played on that trick, so if a single card is led, then only single cards are played; if a straight of seven cards is led, then only straights of seven cards can be played, etc.&#10;&#10;The last player out in a round gives all the cards they won to the player who exited first, and the last player's unplayed cards are handed to the opposite team. Fives, tens and Kings are worth 5, 10 and 10 points, with each hand worth one hundred points without bonuses &mdash; but the bonuses are what drive the game. At the start of a round, each player can call &quot;Tichu&quot; prior to playing any card. This indicates that the player thinks they can empty their hand first this round; if they do so, their team scores 100 points, and if not, their team instead loses 100 points. Cards are dealt at the start of a round in a group of eight and a group of six; a player can call &quot;Grand Tichu&quot; after looking at only their first eight cards for a &plusmn;200 point bonus. If both players on a team exit a round prior to either player on the opposite team, then no points are scored for cards and the winning team earns 200 points (with Tichu/Grand Tichu bonuses and penalties being applied as normal).&#10;&#10;The first team to 1,000 points wins.&#10;&#10;	\N	4	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/gz8_8iYP2SSGVAxpp7CwLg__original/img/9ULfNvkyu0k1m0d63-Mk0k5e0MA=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic5854968.png	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/gz8_8iYP2SSGVAxpp7CwLg__thumb/img/5jkPnPGk5LWNzuW5GANPDLa4ZRA=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5854968.png
416	822	Carcassonne	Carcassonne is a tile-placement game in which the players draw and place a tile with a piece of southern French landscape on it. The tile might feature a city, a road, a cloister, grassland or some combination thereof, and it must be placed adjacent to tiles that have already been played, in such a way that cities are connected to cities, roads to roads, etcetera. Having placed a tile, the player can then decide to place one of their meeples on one of the areas on it: on the city as a knight, on the road as a robber, on a cloister as a monk, or on the grass as a farmer. When that area is complete, that meeple scores points for its owner.&#10;&#10;During a game of Carcassonne, players are faced with decisions like: &quot;Is it really worth putting my last meeple there?&quot; or &quot;Should I use this tile to expand my city, or should I place it near my opponent instead, giving him a hard time to complete their project and score points?&quot; Since players place only one tile and have the option to place one meeple on it, turns proceed quickly even if it is a game full of options and possibilities.&#10;&#10;First game in the Carcassonne series.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	5	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/okM0dq_bEXnbyQTOvHfwRA__original/img/aVZEXAI-cUtuunNfPhjeHlS4fwQ=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic6544250.png	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/okM0dq_bEXnbyQTOvHfwRA__thumb/img/88274KiOg94wziybVHyW8AeOiXg=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6544250.png
417	245638	Coimbra	In the 15th and 16th century, Portugal is thriving under its leading role during the Age of Discovery. Nestled in the heart of Portugal, the city of Coimbra serves as a&nbsp;cultural center of the country. As the head of one of Coimbra's oldest houses, you seek to earn prestige by deepening relationships with nearby monasteries or funding expeditions of the era.&nbsp;To reach this goal, you must vie for the favors of the city's most influential citizens, even if you must offer a bit of coin or some protective detail.&#10;&#10;Coimbra introduces an innovative new dice mechanism in which the dice players draft each round are used in multiple different ways and have an impact on many aspects of their decision making. While there are many paths to victory,&nbsp;players should always seek to optimize their&nbsp;opportunities with every roll of the dice.&nbsp;Combined with ever-changing synergies of the citizens, expeditions, and monasteries, no two games of Coimbra will ever be the same!&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/JJFHx0RiUBYdy9bHAgVSuA__original/img/zwcZQov_aUfBN0z9J9PzsJqomeI=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3956079.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/JJFHx0RiUBYdy9bHAgVSuA__thumb/img/-eaAIbixYxRRVj0tDTS1oP_9Njk=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3956079.jpg

A lost love, redemption, acceptance, a family rejoined-- these are the fires that fuel the wanderers' journeys, but can they overcome their own greed and inner demons on the way?&#10;&#10;In Near and Far, you and up to three friends explore many different maps in a search for the Last Ruin, recruiting adventurers, hunting for treasure, and competing to be the most storied traveler. You must collect food and equipment at town for long journeys to mysterious locales, making sure not to forget enough weapons to fight off bandits, living statues, and rusty robots! Sometimes in your travels you'll run into something unique and one of your friends will read what happens to you from a book of stories, giving you a choice of how to react, creating a new and memorable tale each time you play.&#10;&#10;Near and Far is a sequel to Above and Below and includes a book of encounters.

419	21050	Combat Commander: Europe	Combat Commander: Europe is a card-driven board game covering tactical infantry combat in the European Theater of World War II. One player takes the role of the Axis (Germany) while another player commands the Allies (America or Russia). These two players will take turns playing one or more &ldquo;Fate&rdquo; cards from their hands in order to activate their units on the mapboard for various military functions.&#10;&#10;Players attempt to achieve victory by moving their combat units across the game map to attack their opponent&rsquo;s combat units and occupy as many objectives as possible. The degree to which a player succeeds or fails is measured by a scenario&rsquo;s specific &ldquo;Objective&rdquo; chits, the destruction of enemy units, and the exiting of friendly units off the opponent&rsquo;s board edge.&#10;&#10;A game of Combat Commander is divided into several measures of Game Time. There is no sequence of play to follow, however: each Time segment is divided into a variable number of Player Turns, each of which may consist of one or more Fate Card &quot;Orders&quot; conducted by the active player. Fate Card &quot;Actions&quot; may generally be conducted by either player at any time. &quot;Events&quot; &mdash; both good and bad &mdash; will occur at random intervals to add a bit of chaos and uncertainty to each player&rsquo;s perfect plan.&#10;&#10;SCALE: Each hex of a Combat Commander map is roughly 100 feet of distance (about 30 meters). Each complete Player Phase abstractly represents several seconds of real time. Each complete measure of Game Time abstractly represents several minutes of real time.&#10;&#10;Each unit in the game is approximated as either a single Leader, a 5-man Team, or a 10-man Squad. Radios &mdash; and individual weapons larger than a pistol, rifle or BAR &mdash; are represented by their own counters.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#10;	\N	2	2	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/uKaL10FK-u9wfYyK6MQaNg__original/img/_UDsTX8nCwdsynpoVtzHJHc8h6c=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic992459.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/uKaL10FK-u9wfYyK6MQaNg__thumb/img/4KyQXL7NMnaXSVYimKkJRCjQ2I8=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic992459.jpg
420	221194	Dinosaur Island	In Dinosaur Island, players will have to collect DNA, research the DNA sequences of extinct dinosaur species, and then combine the ancient DNA in the correct sequence to bring these prehistoric creatures back to life.

They'll definitely excite potential visitors, but you'd better make a large enough enclosure for them. And maybe hire some (read: a lot of) security. Or they WILL break out and start eating your visitors, and we all know how that ends. You could play it safe and grow a bunch of herbivores, but then you aren't going to have the most exciting park in the world (sad face).

427	91	Paths of Glory	(from GMT Games' website:)&#10;&#10;They called it the Great War. In over four years of titanic struggle, the ancient Europe of Kings and Emperors tore itself to pieces, giving birth to our own violent modern age. The bloody battles fought in the trenches of the Western Front, the icy plains of Poland, the mountains of the Balkans, and the deserts of Arabia, shaped the world we know today. We are all orphans of the Great War.&#10;&#10;Paths of Glory: The First World War, designed by six-time Charles S. Roberts awards winner, Ted Raicer, allows players to step into the shoes of the monarchs and marshals who triumphed and bungled from 1914 to 1918. As the Central Powers you must use the advantage of interior lines and the fighting skill of the Imperial German Army to win your rightful 'place in the sun.' As the Entente Powers (Allies) you must bring your greater numbers to bear to put an end to German militarism and ensure this is the war 'to end all wars.' Both players will find their generalship and strategic abilities put to the test as Paths of Glory's innovative game systems let you recreate all the dramatic events of World War I.&#10;&#10;Components:&#10;&#10;     316 full-color die-cut counters:&#10;         176 5/8&rdquo; die cut counters&#10;         140 1/2&rdquo; die cut counters&#10;    &#10;     One 22x34&quot; full-color mapsheet showing most of Europe and the Near East&#10;     110 Strategy Cards&#10;     32-page Rule Book including sample game replay (21 pages of actual rules)&#10;     Two Player Reference Cards &#10;&#10;&#10;DESIGNER: Ted Raicer&#10;DEVELOPER: Andy Lewis&#10;ART DIRECTOR: Rodger B.

The game covers WWI from its outbreak to American intervention and spans all of Europe and the Middle East.  Not only is the game innovative, but it also plays fast, usually within just an evening.&#10;&#10;While the game itself has all of the normal expectations of a wargame, with various units, CRT charts and period chrome, at heart the game rests within the card play.  Players are given a hand of cards to play out six sub-phases of a turn.  Each sub-phase allows for the use of a card or a pass with a minimal movement of units.  Each card has four possible uses: operational movement, strategic movement, special events, and replacement points.  The cardplay forces players to constantly make tough decsions as they feel that they need to do a little bit of everything but they can only do one thing at a time.  How you play your cards will decide to a large degree the outcome of the war.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	2	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Ip4TygnwFxuR57Vky9ZeZA__original/img/MP1e5GdDAT-4QO734-n8_rUkMv8=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4490515.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Ip4TygnwFxuR57Vky9ZeZA__thumb/img/6yGJ8gs7e_WwYJc5Y7pXgTBFxF8=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4490515.jpg
428	7854	YINSH	In YINSH, the players each start with five rings on the board. Every time a ring is moved, it leaves a marker behind. Markers are white on one side and black on the other. When markers are jumped over by a ring they must be flipped, so their color is constantly changing. The players must try to form a row of five markers with their own color face up. If a player succeeds in doing so, he removes one of his rings as an indication that he has formed such a row. The first player to remove three of his rings wins the game. In other words, each row you make brings you closer to victory-but also makes you weaker, because you have one fewer ring to play with. Very tricky!&#10;&#10;	\N	2	2	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/a9Dco_g83IUWxrpxsw8ibw__original/img/Ho4DXQbjk8ze91242SC_L14toxs=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic2844830.png	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/a9Dco_g83IUWxrpxsw8ibw__thumb/img/2JsnDtb5luvivTuwyHdEkGkxyNs=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2844830.png
430	9209	Ticket to Ride	With elegantly simple gameplay, Ticket to Ride can be learned in under 15 minutes. Players collect cards of various types of train cars they then use to claim railway routes in North America. The longer the routes, the more points they earn. Additional points come to those who fulfill Destination Tickets &ndash; goal cards that connect distant cities; and to the player who builds the longest continuous route.&#10;&#10;&quot;The rules are simple enough to write on a train ticket &ndash; each turn you either draw more cards, claim a route, or get additional Destination Tickets,&quot; says Ticket to Ride author, Alan R. Moon. &quot;The tension comes from being forced to balance greed &ndash; adding more cards to your hand, and fear &ndash; losing a critical route to a competitor.&quot;&#10;&#10;Ticket to Ride continues in the tradition of Days of Wonder's big format board games featuring high-quality illustrations and components including: an oversize board map of North America, 225 custom-molded train cars, 144 illustrated cards, and wooden scoring markers.&#10;&#10;Since its introduction and numerous subsequent awards, Ticket to Ride has become the BoardGameGeek epitome of a &quot;gateway game&quot; -- simple enough to be taught in a few minutes, and with enough action and tension to keep new players involved and in the game for the duration.&#10;&#10;Part of the Ticket to Ride series.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	5	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ZWJg0dCdrWHxVnc0eFXK8w__original/img/LgzEsQlF3xkSEQLoorc8ntiYiIY=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic38668.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ZWJg0dCdrWHxVnc0eFXK8w__thumb/img/a9rsFV6KR0aun8GobhRU16aU8Kc=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic38668.jpg
431	54998	Cyclades	In this latest collaboration between Bruno Cathala and Ludovic Maublanc, players must buy the favor of the gods in their race to be the first player to build two cities in the Ancient Greek island group known as the Cyclades.&#10;&#10;Victory requires respect for all the gods - players cannot afford to sacrifice to only one god, but must pay homage to each of five gods in turn.  Each turn, the players bid for the favors of the gods, as only one player can have the favor of each god per turn - and each player is also limited to the favor of a single god per turn.&#10;&#10;     Ares allows the movement of player armies and the building of Fortresses.&#10;     Poseidon allows players to move their navies and build Ports.&#10;     Zeus allows his followers to hire priests and build temples.&#10;     Athena provides her worshipers with philosophers and universities.&#10;     Apollo increases the income of his worshipers.&#10;&#10;&#10;	\N	2	5	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/6QbaJOS8acWkJ6gSYI0KaQ__original/img/KOGjizqhVHXlKWxXkuyxkHRCNnA=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic584779.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/6QbaJOS8acWkJ6gSYI0KaQ__thumb/img/YSxmsx_zxqdVoqNVGsNnAqyH1lc=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic584779.jpg

433	146886	La Granja	In La Granja, players control small farms by the Alpich pond near the village of Esporles on the island of Mallorca. Over time, the players develop their farms and deliver goods to the village. Players are vying to earn the title of &quot;La Granja&quot; for their country estate!&#10;&#10;Over the course of 6 game rounds, players will expand their farm by adding fields, farm extensions, market barrows, and helpers.  They will earn VPs by delivering goods to the village of Esporles.  It is important to observe the actions of other players, manipulate turn order, and adjust your strategy based on the dice and cards.&#10;&#10;La Granja is a fascinating game that requires careful planning. Timing and speed is crucial. However, successful players must cope with the uncertainty of events during the game.

434	224037	Codenames: Duet	Codenames Duet keeps the basic elements of Codenames &mdash; give one-word clues to try to get someone to identify your agents among those on the table &mdash; but now you're working together as a team to find all of your agents. (Why you don't already know who your agents are is a question that Congressional investigators will get on your back about later!)&#10;&#10;To set up play, lay out 25 word cards in a 5&times;5 grid. Place a key card in the holder so that each player sees one side of the card. Each player sees a 5&times;5 grid on the card, with nine of the squares colored green (representing your agents) and three squares colored black (representing assassins). Three of the nine squares on each side are also green on the other side, one assassin is black on both sides, one is green on the other side and the other is an innocent bystander on the other side.&#10;&#10;Collectively, you need to reveal all fifteen agents &mdash; without revealing an assassin &mdash; before time runs out in order to win the game. Either player can decide to give the first one-word clue to the other player, along with a number. Whoever receives the clue places a finger on a card to identify that agent. If correct, they can attempt to identify another one. If they identify a bystander, then their guessing time ends. If they identify an assassin, you both lose! Unlike regular Codenames, they can keep guessing as long as they keep identifying an agent each time; this is useful for going back to previous clues and finding ones they missed earlier. After the first clue is given, players alternate giving clues.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	2	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/0d1EaMVmAiIBROI2QstFSQ__original/img/udyeiYgfDrEymxhfgtqODm0GwwA=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3596681.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/0d1EaMVmAiIBROI2QstFSQ__thumb/img/J-thZd7Pbbh1CE8QHcvEE4w8FBE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3596681.jpg
435	188834	Secret Hitler	Secret Hitler is a dramatic game of political intrigue and betrayal set in 1930s Germany. Each player is randomly and secretly assigned to be a liberal or a fascist, and one player is Secret Hitler. The fascists coordinate to sow distrust and install their cold-blooded leader; the liberals must find and stop the Secret Hitler before it's too late. The liberal team always has a majority.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of the game, players close their eyes, and the fascists reveal themselves to one another. Secret Hitler keeps his eyes closed, but puts his thumb up so the fascists can see who he is. The fascists learn who Hitler is, but Hitler doesn't know who his fellow fascists are, and the liberals don't know who anyone is.&#10;&#10;Each round, players elect a President and a Chancellor who will work together to enact a law from a random deck. If the government passes a fascist law, players must try to figure out if they were betrayed or simply unlucky. Secret Hitler also features government powers that come into play as fascism advances. The fascists will use those powers to create chaos unless liberals can pull the nation back from the brink of war.&#10;&#10;The objective of the liberal team is to pass five liberal policies or assassinate Secret Hitler. The objective of the fascist team is to pass six fascist policies or elect Secret Hitler chancellor after three fascist policies have passed.&#10;&#10;	\N	5	10	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/rAQ3hIXoH6xDcj41v9iqCg__original/img/7oKwNUYakx3-vHUBLHWVuFNKfl4=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5164305.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/rAQ3hIXoH6xDcj41v9iqCg__thumb/img/xA2T7PiwN3Z8pwAksicoCOA1tf0=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5164305.jpg

437	129437	Legendary: A Marvel Deck Building Game	Legendary: A Marvel Deck Building Game is set in the Marvel Comics universe. To set up the game, players choose a mastermind villain (Magneto, Loki, Dr. Doom, Red Skull in the base game), stack that particular villain's attack cards underneath it, then modify the villain deck as needed based on that villain's particular scheme. Players then choose a number of hero decks &ndash; Spider-Man, Hulk, Wolverine, etc. &ndash; and shuffle them together; since players use only a handful of hero decks out of the fifteen included, the hero deck can vary widely in terms of what's available.&#10;&#10;Over the course of the game, players will recruit powerful hero cards to add to their deck in order to build a stronger and more resourceful deck. Players need to build both their recruitment powers (to enlist more heroes) and their fighting ability (to combat the villains who keep popping up to cause trouble). Players recruit heroes from an array of five cards, with empty slots refilled as needed. At the start of a player's turn, he reveals a villain and adds it to the row of villains. This row has a limited number of spaces, and if it fills up, the earliest villain to arrive escapes, possibly punishing the heroes in some way. Some villains also take an action when showing up for the first time, such as kidnapping an innocent bystander. The villain deck also contains &quot;master strike&quot; cards, and whenever one of these shows up, the mastermind villain (controlled by the game) takes a bonus action.&#10;&#10;As players fight and defeat villains, they collect those cards, which will be worth points at game's end. Players can also fight the mastermind; if a player has enough fighting power, he claims one of the attack cards beneath the mastermind, which has a particular effect on the game. If all of these cards are claimed, the game ends and players tally their points to see who wins. If the mastermind completes his scheme, however &ndash; having a certain number of villains escape, for example, or imposing a certain number of wounds on the heroes &ndash; then the players all lose.&#10;&#10;Hero decks in the base game: Gambit, Black Widow, Hawkeye, Emma Frost, Thor, Spider-Man, Iron Man, Storm, Captain America, Nick Fury, Rogue, Cyclops, Hulk, Wolverine, Deadpool&#10;&#10;	\N	1	5	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ZrRidumkzu62HuwKdgQpHA__original/img/FqPcmpzntFV1FDR6dniHGKvNwvI=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1430769.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ZrRidumkzu62HuwKdgQpHA__thumb/img/Q9zldSDfcsSXiD6SC4MU-dwCl5g=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1430769.jpg

439	156129	Deception: Murder in Hong Kong	Deception: Murder in Hong Kong is a game of deduction and deception for 4-12 players that plays in about 20 minutes.&#10;&#10;In the game, players take on the roles of investigators attempting to solve a murder case &ndash; but there's a twist. The killer is one of the investigators! Each player's role and team are randomly assigned at the start of play and include the unique roles of Forensic Scientist, Witness, Investigator, Murderer, and Accomplice. While the Investigators attempt to deduce the truth, the murderer's team must deceive and mislead. This is a battle of wits!&#10;&#10;The Forensic Scientist has the solution but can express the clues only using special scene tiles while the investigators (and the murderer) attempt to interpret the evidence. In order to succeed, the investigators must not only deduce the truth from the clues of the Forensic Scientist, they must also see through the misdirection being injected into the equation by the Murderer and Accomplice!&#10;&#10;Find out who among you can cut through deception to find the truth and who is capable of getting away with murder!&#10;&#10;Roles&#10;&#10;Forensic Scientist x1&#10;As the game master, the Forensic Scientist holds the solution to the crime. They are responsible for assisting the Investigators in identifying the &ldquo;Key Evidence&rdquo; and &ldquo;Means of Murder.&rdquo; When an Investigator does that successfully, the crime is solved and the Forensic Scientist and the Investigators win the game.&#10;&#10;During the game, the Forensic Scientist is NOT allowed to hint to the solution with words, gestures, or eyes.&#10;&#10;Murderer x1&#10;When the crime takes place, the Murderer chooses 1 Clue card and 1 Means card as the solution to the crime. These will be the &ldquo;Key Evidence&rdquo; and &ldquo;Means of Murder&rdquo; respectively.&#10;&#10;The Murderer tries to hide their role and look for a scapegoat. Even if they are identified, the Murderer still wins the game if no one correctly identifies both the &ldquo;Key Evidence&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Means of Murder&rdquo;.&#10;&#10;Investigators x8&#10;To solve the crime, the Investigators must analyze the hints given by the Forensic Scientist. As long as one of the Investigators correctly identifies both the &ldquo;Key Evidence&rdquo; and &ldquo;Means of Murder,&rdquo; the Murderer is arrested and the Investigators win the game (as does the Forensic Scientist).&#10;&#10;Bear in mind that the Murderer (and sometimes Accomplice) is among the Investigators! The innocent Investigators must make a vigorous effort to defend themselves from false accusation.&#10;&#10;Accomplice x1&#10;The Accomplice is an optional role for games with six or more players. The Accomplice knows who the Murderer is, as well as the solution to the crime. The Accomplice and Murderer both win if the Murderer gets away with his crime.&#10;&#10;Witness x1&#10;The Witness is an optional role when playing with six or more players.* The Witness is an Investigator who has witnessed the culprits leaving the crime scene. They have no way of knowing which is the Murderer and which is the Accomplice and they do not know how the crime was committed.&#10;&#10;If the Murderer is arrested but can identify the Witness, the Witness is considered to be killed, allowing the Murderer and the Accomplice to get away with murder and win the game.&#10;&#10;	\N	4	12	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/1COY3oeK9aN2_XNimKaNww__original/img/ZzyzlO15ggCfkLg9ckeM4PWNePI=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3033330.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/1COY3oeK9aN2_XNimKaNww__thumb/img/8IWDjnSYX-tYAVRgfq-W3y1b_Ww=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3033330.jpg

444	555	The Princes of Florence	In The Princes of Florence, players attract artists and scholars to their palace while trying to become the most prestigious family in Florence.&#10;&#10;Over seven rounds, players attempt to score points in various ways, with most points being earned by playing profession cards to generate &quot;work points&quot;, which can be exchanged for money or victory points. The game includes a variety of professions, such astronomers, organists, and architects; each profession is attracted to a particular combination of building, landscape feature, and social freedom, and players acquire these items via auctions. The more that a player can match these preferences, the more work points they earn &mdash; but the minimum requirement of work points increases each round, and you must meet that threshold in order to convert the work points.&#10;&#10;	\N	1	5	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/GdXWqyTfO8F_M9hFtfo-HA__original/img/832FztQEizwRR3FnHIx1Zgjkw8Y=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic7565506.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/GdXWqyTfO8F_M9hFtfo-HA__thumb/img/z76c9lnWodF4G-JWPYen5oFj3hs=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7565506.jpg

448	109276	Kanban: Driver's Edition	&quot;Kanban&quot; &mdash; or &#231;&#156;&#139;&#230;&#157;&#191;, the Japanese word for billboard &mdash; is a term for the visual cues that might be used in a lean, efficient assembly line in order to expedite and smooth workflow. These signals get the workers what they need, where they need it, when they need it to create a just-in-time (JIT) production system.&#10;&#10;The setting for the game Kanban: Automotive Revolution is an assembly line. The players are ambitious managers who are trying to impress the board of directors in order to achieve as high a position as possible in the company and secure their careers. With promotions come advantages at the factory, such as more space to store precious materials and greater prestige to accelerate your ascent. Through solid management, you must strive to shine next to your peers. You need to manage suppliers and supplies, improve automobile parts, innovate &mdash; anything to stay on the cutting edge, or getting your hands greasy on the assembly line in order to boost production. You must exercise wisdom in choosing which projects you should start, selecting only those that will give you the upper hand and shunning those that will bog you down or cause the unthinkable &mdash; failure &mdash; which would diminish you in the eyes of the board.&#10;&#10;Over the course of the game, you persuade the board and the factory tender to help you develop and improve automobile parts. You make shrewd use of the outside suppliers and the limited factory supplies in order to appropriate needed part when the suppliers come up short. Because the factory must run at optimum efficiency, production doesn't wait for you or for mistakes.&#10;&#10;Like the process itself, Kanban: Automotive Revolution proves to be both innovative and rewarding. Game mechanisms tightly tied to the automobile manufacturing theme include:&#10;&#10;&#10;    The factory manager is a game-driven non-player character with two modes of play (&quot;nice&quot; or &quot;mean&quot;) to offer a friendly or more competitive gameplay environment.&#10;    Two independent player-influenced game timers &mdash; the factory production cycle and work week clock &mdash; provide timing tension to the game, trigger intermediate scoring phases, and factor into the game end conditions.&#10;    A simulation of the factory assembly line with spatial point-to-point movement adds an element to the game that requires optimal timing.&#10;    A design and innovation department, leveraged to manipulate the value of the various car models and component upgrades produced within the factory, drives the economy of the game.&#10;    Departmental training and certification tracks provide players a means to operate more efficiently.&#10;&#10;&#10;If you want a seat on the board someday, you need to show that you can keep a complex machine running smoothly, efficiently, with everything happening just at the right time. Kanban: Automotive Revolution is a pure Eurogame focused on economics and resource management that puts you in the driver's seat of an entire production facility, racing for the highest level of promotion.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/rzSmS-GD8_pGl9bWo07FWQ__original/img/TFtpuGRO0cbVjWl03YhtzTBRk5A=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5638431.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/rzSmS-GD8_pGl9bWo07FWQ__thumb/img/jo2betPcpo8mVZPIs993TT_nOMo=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5638431.jpg
449	165722	KLASK	The KLASK game board is shaped like a ball field with two deep holes functioning as goals in each end of the field. In the middle of the field, three white magnetic pieces serve as &quot;obstacles&quot; &ndash; do NOT attract them to your own gaming piece! Your gaming piece is a black magnet. You control it by holding a large magnet under the board. This magnet is connected to a small magnet placed on the field. The purpose of the game is to push the small, red ball around on the field with your magnet/gaming piece, shoot the ball past the obstacles and your opponent and into the goal hole (Klask). It&rsquo;s so much fun when your opponent suddenly is covered in white obstacles or you drop your gaming piece into the goal &ndash; something which might happen if you get a little too eager!&#10;&#10;Place the game board on a table between the two players. Place the three white magnetic pieces on the white fields on the board. Put two coins in each point slot next to the &quot;0&quot;. Each player has a black magnetic gaming piece in two parts. Place the short (thin) part on top of the board and the long (thick) part under the board in such a way, so the two parts &ldquo;catch&rdquo; each other. Place the ball in the corner start field. Steer it with the black gaming pieces.&#10;&#10;The youngest player starts the game. You score a point if:&#10;&#10;&#10;    The ball ends in your opponent's hole and stays in the hole.&#10;    Two or all of the three white magnetic pieces stick to your opponent's gaming piece.&#10;    The opponent accidentally pulls their gaming piece into their own goal hole.&#10;    If the opponent loses their gaming piece.&#10;&#10;&#10;Each time you get a point, you must move your coin one point forward in the point slot. The player who first reaches the KLASK field wins.&#10;&#10;During the game:&#10;&#10;&#10;    If one of the white magnetic pieces sticks to a gaming piece, the game continues; if two of the white magnetic pieces stick to one gaming piece, the opponent gets one point.&#10;    If the ball falls over the edges of the board, you must place the ball in the corner start field in the half from which the ball fell.&#10;    If one or more white magnetic pieces fall over the edges of the board, the game continues.&#10;    Each time a player scores a point, you must put the white magnetic pieces back on the white fields on the board, and the player who did not score a point places the ball in their corner start field.&#10;&#10;&#10;	\N	2	2	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/oPNuEm_dR987BKoYEF9zGQ__original/img/ZNqEkLMKkrIPxRduZWmWC6VBgoY=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic7414566.png	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/oPNuEm_dR987BKoYEF9zGQ__thumb/img/JeO68IlD-DGB8zg2ozB-3MmpN2s=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7414566.png
450	274637	Unmatched: Battle of Legends, Volume One	In battle, there are no equals.&#10;&#10;Unmatched is a highly asymmetrical miniature fighting game for two or four players. Each hero is represented by a unique deck designed to evoke their style and legend. Tactical movement and no-luck combat resolution create a unique play experience that rewards expertise, but just when you've mastered one set, new heroes arrive to provide all new match-ups.&#10;&#10;Battle of Legends, Volume One features four heroes. King Arthur sacrifices cards to power up his attacks and gets some timely assistance from Merlin's magic. Alice is back from Wonderland with a giant vorpal blade and the Jabberwock by her side as she grows and shrinks to gain advantages on attack and defense. Medusa is happy to attack from range and let her harpies hound you, but just one devastating glance could end the battle quickly. Sinbad grows in power as he gains experience on each of his voyages.&#10;&#10;Combat is resolved quickly by comparing attack and defense cards. However, each card's unique effects and a simple but deep timing system lead to interesting decisions each time. The game also features an updated version of the line-of-sight system from Tannh&auml;user for ranged attacks and area effects.&#10;&#10;The game includes a double-sided board with two different battlefields, pre-washed miniatures for each hero, and custom life trackers that's brought to life with the stunning artwork of Oliver Barrett and the combined design teams of Restoration Games and Mondo Games.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/4AlLbprNustr9G7pbkGRuw__original/img/d7Z89SEv9T_HqPaYEomeKcFmgeA=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4621579.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/4AlLbprNustr9G7pbkGRuw__thumb/img/nVkIL7RgCkFpBuxbJ3BfOxIJscU=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4621579.jpg
451	9216	Goa: A New Expedition	Goa, a strategy game of auctions and resource management, is set at the start of the 16th century: beautiful beaches, a mild climate, and one of the most important trading centers in the world. Competing companies deal in spices, send ships and colonists into the world, and invest money. Are you on top or at the bottom? It depends on how you invest your profits. Will you make your ships more efficient? Enhance your plantations? Recruit more colonists? Only a steady hand in business will help.&#10;&#10;Each turn begins with an auction phase, where each player gets to auction one item (and the starting player two items). The first item being auctioned gives the right to go first the next turn (along with a card that gives an extra action). If you buy your own item, you pay it to the bank. If someone else buys the item you sell, they pay you. Items include plantations complete with crops, income tiles (income in money, ships, plantation refills each turn etc.), ships, settlers, and later on tiles that score points for certain achievements.&#10;&#10;After the auction, players get three actions to either improve their technologies or produce things such as spices on plantations, ships, money or build more plantations. Each player has a board showing their advancement for various things: getting ships, planting new spices, getting colonists, etc. The more a player advances along one track, the better one is doing that particular action. The further you get along a certain track, the more points that track is worth at the end, and there are also rewards to the first player who reaches the last two levels along each track. On the other hand, each player normally needs to perform the actions for all the tracks at some point, so it's not necessarily a good idea to concentrate on just a couple of them. Goa is a game that gives plenty of opportunity for tough decisions, since a player always has at least one action too few.&#10;&#10;The game mixes an interactive element of the auction, which encourages you to nominate things that other players want so you receive cash with the solitaire management of your plantation, which then interacts later on as players race to be first in the top tech levels.&#10;&#10;The 2012 edition of Goa includes four new tiles and a new play variant, as noted on the cover of the Z-Man Games edition.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/9sbSKcc-Fm8Od5wwuf3kgg__original/img/kNoFZrbwsvMvs_iKWeKBHYLka5Y=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1215969.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/9sbSKcc-Fm8Od5wwuf3kgg__thumb/img/pb63LQr94bzh4Z6ofLNJoijRlxU=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1215969.jpg

The earlier you place your bet, the more you can win &mdash; should you guess correctly, of course. Camels don't run neatly, however, sometimes landing on top of another one and being carried toward the finish line. Who's going to run when?

The landscape of Isle of Skye is breathtaking and fascinates everyone.&#10;&#10;In the tile-laying game Isle of Skye: From Chieftain to King, 2&ndash;5 players are chieftains of famous clans and want to build their kingdoms to score as many points as possible&mdash;but in each game only four of the sixteen scoring tiles will be scored.&#10;&#10;Thanks to the scoring tiles, each game is different and leads to different tactics and strategies, but having enough money is useful no matter what else is going on. Managing that money can be tricky, though. Each turn, each player places two area tiles in front of them and sets the selling price for the tiles. Setting a high price is great, but only so long as someone actually pays the price because if no one opts to buy, then the seller must buy the tiles at the price they previously requested.&#10;&#10;In the end, the player with the best kingdom&mdash;and not the richest player&mdash;becomes the sovereign of the island.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	5	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/GCxsnITFBO1pNXiBYkq_qA__original/img/8uoTbz4B_M1GbT4N3vGN-bhZF2Q=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2524838.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/GCxsnITFBO1pNXiBYkq_qA__thumb/img/0BJUretj0lJj09f2JjDGrQzmakI=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2524838.jpg

457	19857	Glory to Rome	In 64 A.D., a great fire originating from the slums of Rome quickly spreads to destroy much of the city, including the imperial palace. Upon hearing news of the fire, Emperor Nero Caesar races back to Rome from his private estate in Antium and sets up shelters for the displaced population.  Reporting directly to Nero, you are responsible for rebuilding the structures lost in the fire and restoring Glory to Rome.&#10;&#10;Glory to Rome is a card-based city building and resource management game with a novel mechanism. Each card may act as a building, a client, a raw material, or a valuable resource, frequently forcing players into difficult decisions regarding how each card should be used. In addition, much of the game is played from the discard pool, giving players some control over what cards are accessible to opponents.  Actions are triggered by a form of card-driven role selection -- the active player leads a role, and other players may follow if they discard a matching card from hand (to the pool).  Players who don't follow may 'think' to draw more cards.  There are thus strong interactions between the different uses of cards.  Scoring is a combination of completing buildings and storing resources, with end-of-game bonuses for storing a diverse assortment. Game length is player-controlled, and is triggered in a few different ways.&#10;&#10;The lighthearted artwork of the original editions was replaced by minimalist art in the 'black box' edition, and both have been the source of great controversy.  Many of the non-English editions use more conventional artwork.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	5	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/S_-n-WRvpzgH-d8xuzJgmg__original/img/cvWVDcSUBsngibbELMhABgIyrVo=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic1079512.png	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/S_-n-WRvpzgH-d8xuzJgmg__thumb/img/2KvAr_TOIvW-9DNxlX-KuyL0Fwo=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1079512.png

460	198994	Hero Realms	Hero Realms is a fantasy-themed deck-building game that is an adaptation of the award-winning Star Realms game. The game includes basic rules for two-player games, along with rules for multiplayer formats such as Free-For-All, Hunter, and Hydra.&#10;&#10;Each player starts the game with a ten-card personal deck containing gold (for buying) and weapons (for combat). You start each turn with a new hand of five cards from your personal deck. When your deck runs out of cards, you shuffle your discard pile into your new deck. An 80-card Market deck is shared by all players, with five cards being revealed from that deck to create the Market Row. As you play, you use gold to buy champion cards and action cards from the Market. These champions and actions can generate large amounts of gold, combat, or other powerful effects. You use combat to attack your opponent and their champions. When you reduce your opponent's score (called health) to zero, you win!&#10;&#10;Multiple expansions are available for Hero Realms that allow players to start as a particular character (Cleric, Fighter, Ranger, Thief, or Wizard) and fight cooperatively against a Boss, fight Boss decks against one another, or compete in a campaign mode that has you gain experience to work through different levels of missions.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/BZiR636JJdSBwThtH42DVw__original/img/ntif6KjmWg9hGgDmT_4qEIIXv5s=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3744052.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/BZiR636JJdSBwThtH42DVw__thumb/img/UNdB7VkSDleswj3iXhVOxVeqxxc=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3744052.jpg

461	421	1830: Railways & Robber Barons	1830 is one of the most famous 18xx games. One of the things some gamers like about this game is that the game has no 'chance' element. That is to say, if players wished to play two games with the same moves, the outcome would be the same also.&#10;&#10;This game takes the basic mechanics from Tresham's 1829, and adds several new elements. Players are seeking to make the most money by buying and selling stock in various share companies located on eastern United States map. The stock manipulation aspect of the game is widely-regarded as one of the best. The board itself is actually a fairly abstract hexagonal system, with track tiles placed on top of the hexes. Plus each 18xx title adds new and different elements to the game. This game features private rail companies and an extremely vicious, 'robber baron' oriented stock market. A game is finished when the bank runs out of money or one player is forced to declare bankruptcy, and the player with the greatest personal holdings wins.&#10;&#10;The 2011 version of 1830 was published by Mayfair Games in partnership with Lookout Games of Germany. This publication was developed under license from Francis Tresham in co-operation with Bruce Shelley (the original 1830 developer). This version contains rules and components for Francis Tresham's original classic design, a faster-playing basic game, and new variants from some of the world's best railroad game developers.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	7	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/3EmD1SEI5fVpR4rbdkU0AA__original/img/M6qiL7ZNU_mjgZXHZjOrVxNamfU=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic882119.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/3EmD1SEI5fVpR4rbdkU0AA__thumb/img/v_GuoUgKbMTvzcRkTcH6aOH9wWs=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic882119.jpg
462	316377	7 Wonders (Second Edition)	7 Wonders&#10;The board game with more awards than any other game on the planet.&#10;With over 30 international awards, and over a million copies sold throughout the world, rediscover 7 Wonders, the game which has won more awards than any other game in the world, in a whole new version.   Lauded by both the public and critics, 7 Wonders has claimed its place as an unmissable reference point in modern board gaming. 7 Wonders is based on a simple and elegant mechanic (drafting) which allows up to 7 players to play with no dead time. Players make their choice and apply all of them at the same time. These choices are varied and their impact is real. Finally, the game is divided into 3 Ages which little by little increase the importance of these choices and thus the tension in the game. The global mechanics and the care given to the artwork are used to immerse the player in Antiquity and have contributed to the game&rsquo;s success.&#10;A game plays out over 3 rounds, called Ages, during which you simultaneously play cards, one at a time, to develop your City.&#10;&#10;These cards represent the various Buildings you can construct: resource producers, civilian, commercial, military, scientific structures, and guilds.&#10;&#10;At the end of each Age, you go to war with your nearest neighbours. At the end of all 3 Ages, you tally up all of the victory points earned by your City, your wonder, your military prowess, and your treasury. The player with the highest score wins the game.&#10;&#10;Content:&#10;7 Wonder boards&#10;148 Age cards: 49 Age I cards, 49 Age II cards, and 50 Age III cards&#10;78 Coins: 54 Coins of value 1, and 24 Coins of value 3&#10;48 Military Conflict tokens: 24 Defeats and 24 Victories (8 per Age)&#10;1 pad of score sheets&#10;3 quick reference sheets describing the effects of the cards&#10;1 List of cards and chaining leaflet&#10;1 rulebook&#10;&#10;	\N	3	7	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Naw8y8J_s-8cvq1GoTON6w__original/img/8wVEVzdf5BoPvSiscnGvCAPNe2Q=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic7416519.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Naw8y8J_s-8cvq1GoTON6w__thumb/img/ieH8A28KJe3truXqQe1nDXSpxUE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7416519.jpg
463	20551	Shogun	Japan during the Sengoku or &ldquo;Warring States&rdquo; Period (approx. 1467-1573): each player assumes the role of a great Daimyo, leading their troops to conquer the provinces of the Japanese islands.&#10;&#10;Each Daimyo has the same 10 possible actions to develop his kingdom and score points.  Each round, the players decide which of their actions are to be played out and in which of their provinces.  If battle ensues between opposing armies, the unique Cube Tower plays the leading role: cubes (representing troops) from both sides are thrown in together, and those that fall out at the bottom show who has won immediately. Owning provinces, temples, theaters, and castles means points when scores are tallied. Whichever Daimyo has the highest number of points at the end of the game becomes &ndash; SHOGUN!&#10;&#10;Shogun is based on the Wallenstein game system. The game is an international edition with language-independent components and five language-dependent rule booklets.&#10;&#10;Re-implements:&#10;&#10;    Wallenstein&#10;&#10;&#10;	\N	3	5	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/j6UzppDoJv9tKHQl-pWpIw__original/img/Yu1D0BNyavkX_SV8EK056FxfRsw=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3336315.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/j6UzppDoJv9tKHQl-pWpIw__thumb/img/BcVo6uokndgMSoFdIdEmgu-2C1o=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3336315.jpg
464	260605	Camel Up (Second Edition)	In Camel Up, up to eight players bet on five racing camels, trying to suss out which ones will place first and second in a quick race around a pyramid. The earlier you place your bet, the more you can win &mdash; should you guess correctly, of course. Camels don't run neatly, however, sometimes landing on top of another one and being carried toward the finish line. Who's going to run when? That all depends on how the dice come out of the pyramid dice shaker, which releases one die at a time when players pause from their bets long enough to see who's actually moving!&#10;&#10;This 2018 edition of Camel Up features new artwork, a new game board design, a new pyramid design, engraved dice, and new game modes, including crazy rogue camels that start the race running in the opposite direction! You never know how a race will end!&#10;&#10;	\N	3	8	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/pRZrHJNoPQ3gay9EkpuZLw__original/img/VHOeHhfYK3n-wYSP0G9RT26U0uQ=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4304741.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/pRZrHJNoPQ3gay9EkpuZLw__thumb/img/e3Kn0hIHVIvWAE9m8IF7icNxw4s=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4304741.jpg
465	240980	Blood on the Clocktower	In the quiet village of Ravenswood Bluff, &zwnj;a demon walks amongst you...&#10;&#10;During a hellish thunderstorm, on the stroke of midnight, there echoes a bone-chilling scream. The townsfolk rush to investigate and find the town storyteller murdered, their body impaled on the hands of the clocktower, blood dripping onto the cobblestones below. A Demon is on the loose, murdering by night and disguised in human form by day. Some have scraps of information. Others have abilities that fight the evil or protect the innocent. But the Demon and its evil minions are spreading lies to confuse and breed suspicion. Will the good townsfolk put the puzzle together in time to execute the true demon and save themselves? Or will evil overrun this once peaceful village?&#10;&#10;Blood on the Clocktower is a bluffing game enjoyed by 5 to 20 players on opposing teams of Good and Evil, overseen by a Storyteller player who conducts the action and makes crucial decisions. The goal of the game is to successfully deduce and execute the demons before they outnumber the townfolk.&#10;&#10;During a 'day' phase players socialize openly and whisper privately to trade knowledge or spread lies, culminating in a player's execution if a majority suspects them of being Evil. Of a 'night' time, players close their eyes and are woken one at a time by the Storyteller to gather information, spread mischief, or kill.&#10;&#10;The Storyteller uses the game's intricate playing pieces to guide each game, leaving others free to play without a table or board. Players stay in the thick of the action to the very end even if their characters are killed, haunting Ravenswood Bluff as ghosts trying to win from beyond the grave.&#10;&#10;If you arrive late to a game, you can enter after it's started as a powerful Traveller character with unusual talents and questionable allegiances. Each character comes with their own special ability and no two players in a game are ever the same character.&#10;&#10;	\N	5	20	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/HINb2nkFn5IiZxAlzQIs4g__original/img/e7izEwSmnBPiErsIF6hlWbgybBE=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic7009391.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/HINb2nkFn5IiZxAlzQIs4g__thumb/img/cRCX-PIROiSFG5aLvwkn2O7tHsg=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7009391.jpg
466	3	Samurai	Samurai is set in medieval Japan. Players compete to gain the favor of three factions: samurai, peasants, and priests, which are represented by helmet, rice paddy, and Buddha figures scattered about the board, which features the islands of Japan. The competition is waged through the use of hexagonal tiles, each of which help curry favor of one of the three factions &mdash; or all three at once! Players can make lightning-quick strikes with horseback ronin and ships or approach their conquests more methodically. As each figure (helmets, rice paddies, and Buddhas) is surrounded, it is awarded to the player who has gained the most favor with the corresponding group.&#10;&#10;Gameplay continues until all the symbols of one type have been removed from the board or four figures have been removed from play due to a tie for influence.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, players compare captured symbols of each type, competing for majorities in each of the three types. Ties are not uncommon and are broken based on the number of other, &quot;non-majority&quot; symbols each player has collected.&#10;&#10;The game is part of what is sometimes called the Knizia tile-laying trilogy.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/o9-sNXmFS_TLAb7ZlZ4dRA__original/img/TPKZgpNxB_C73RNbhKyP6UR76X0=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3211873.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/o9-sNXmFS_TLAb7ZlZ4dRA__thumb/img/22MSUC0-ZWgwzhi_VKIbENJik1w=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3211873.jpg
467	31481	Galaxy Trucker	In a galaxy far, far away... they need sewer systems, too. Corporation Incorporated builds them. Everyone knows their drivers -- the brave men and women who fear no danger and would, if the pay was good enough, even fly through Hell.&#10; Now you can join them. You will gain access to prefabricated spaceship components cleverly made from sewer pipes. Can you build a space ship durable enough to weather storms of meteors? Armed enough to defend against pirates? Big enough to carry a large crew and valuable cargo? Fast enough to get there first?&#10;&#10;Of course you can. Become a Galaxy Trucker. It's loads of fun.&#10;&#10;Galaxy Trucker is a tile laying game that plays out over two phases: building and flying. The goal is to have the most credits at the end of the game. You can earn credits by delivering goods, defeating pirates, building an efficient ship, and being the furthest along the track at the end of the flying phase.&#10;&#10;Building happens in real time and has players build their personal space ships by grabbing tiles from the middle of the table before the timer runs out. Tiles start out facedown so they won't know what they have until they take it, but they may choose to return it faceup if they don't want it. They must place the tiles they keep in a legal manner in their space ship. Usually this just means lining up the connectors appropriately (single to single, double to double, universal to anything) but also includes proper positioning of guns and engines. Tiles represent a variety of things including guns, engines, storage containers, crew cabins, shields, and batteries. They may also peek at the cards they will encounter in phase 2, but they must sacrifice building time to do this. At any time players may call their ships finished and take an order marker from the center.&#10;&#10;Once building is completed, and ships have been checked for errors, the flight begins. The flight cards are shuffled and player markers are placed on the flight board according to the order markers taken. Cards are revealed one at a time and players interact with them in order. They may include things such as pirates, abandoned vessels, disease outbreaks, meteor showers, worlds with goods to pick up, player-on-player combat zones, and other various things.&#10;&#10;Most of the cards will cause players to move back on the flight track and they must decide if the delay is worth their efforts. When all the cards are encountered players sell any goods they have collected, collect their rewards for finishing in first, second, or third place or having the most intact ship, and then lose some credits for damaged components. Space can be a very dangerous place and it is not uncommon to see your ship break into smaller and smaller pieces or lose some very valuable cargo off the side. If your ship gets damaged too much you can get knocked out of the race, so be careful!&#10;&#10;3 rounds of this are done, and in each round players get a bigger board to build a ship that can hold more components. After the 3rd round the player with the most credits wins!&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/gLFt1Kif5Cfag505_COYYw__original/img/5vUNCkVDoQpcTfmlhFzkS4e1EaQ=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3926631.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/gLFt1Kif5Cfag505_COYYw__thumb/img/WOW_QsRuV1KyP8dLjP0yH6TlpvU=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3926631.jpg
468	364011	Great Western Trail: Argentina	In Great Western Trail: Argentina, you own a vast estancia in Argentina at the end of the 19th century, and you will need to travel the plains of the Pampas with your cattle to deliver them to the main train station in Buenos Aires.&#10;&#10;Great Western Trail: Argentina features gameplay elements similar to Great Western Trail such as deck management, the rondel mechanism, and the ability to upgrade your player board, along with twists on these elements and new features.&#10;&#10;The player board features a new type of worker &mdash; farmers &mdash; and different paths await on the game board to confront you with more choices. Will you take the road with buildings or a path past farmers? Maybe you'll have the chance to use your cows &mdash; well, the strength on your cow cards &mdash; to help farmers, getting them on your side and adding grain, a new type of resource, to your income, with grain being used for boat and city tiles.&#10;&#10;Perhaps you can unlock shortcuts that allow you to deliver your herd to Buenos Aires more quickly. Sure, you'll forfeit the use of action buildings, but maybe you can catch others unaware, with the ships leaving before they deliver. The timing of reaching the central train station to deliver your herd has never been so crucial, and valuable bonuses await on the city's port tiles.&#10;&#10;Money is easier to get in Great Western Trail: Argentina, but you have more to manage in terms of action options, shortcuts, and cards (including the new exhaustion cards), so the challenges won't let up.&#10;&#10;Great Western Trail: Argentina also includes a solitaire challenge in which Pedro is waiting for you to try to beat his score.&#10;&#10;	\N	1	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/qPNWng17gy-ghltZfNcBwA__original/img/mPJnr0qY9uAap4HKmwBoURzzaZ0=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic6893215.png	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/qPNWng17gy-ghltZfNcBwA__thumb/img/gTiEnEHt4zbNFftaB0NSXz42jNA=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6893215.png
469	224783	Vindication	Vindication (formerly Epoch: The Awakening) is a highly strategic, fantasy-based tabletop journey for 2-5 players. Play time is 15-30 minutes per player.&#10;&#10;Thrown overboard for a life of wretchedness, you wash ashore a hostile island ruins &mdash; completely alone with nothing except the breath in your lungs and an undaunted spirit.&#10;&#10;Through your advanced resource management, area control tactics, and freeform action selection, you&rsquo;ll add companions to your party, acquire bizarre relics, attain potent character traits, and defeat a host of unusual monsters in the ultimate goal of mastering heroic attributes &mdash; and regaining honor.&#10;&#10;You may perform 3 actions on each turn in the order you feel is most advantageous that turn:  activate a companion, travel to a new location, and interact with a map tile. Many actions require the the use of your influence to gain attributes in a one-of-a-kind heroic attribute alchemy system, which is leveraged to gain the game's most powerful rewards. For example, you can meditate at a spire to gain inspiration. You can train at a fort to gain strength. But then you can combine your inspiration and strength to gain the courage (inspired strength) which allows you to perform a bounty hunt.&#10;&#10;There are distinctive end-game triggers that can be affected through game play, over 72 unique card abilities that can be merged in unusual ways for potent combinations, and fresh tile placement each game for high replayability.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	5	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/8kEIlWY3rg27NgmVBZkFyg__original/img/LgCwqEKxO2mpOzXf5_6z_pt6vz0=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4101638.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/8kEIlWY3rg27NgmVBZkFyg__thumb/img/NYzya2nOQJaZolgQGxKXiBd_O6g=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4101638.jpg
470	128621	Viticulture	In Viticulture, the players find themselves in the roles of people in rustic, pre-modern Tuscany who have inherited meager vineyards. They have a few plots of land, an old crushpad, a tiny cellar, and three workers. They each have a dream of being the first to call their winery a true success.&#10;&#10;The players are in the position of determining how they want to allocate their workers throughout the year. Every season is different on a vineyard, so the workers have different tasks they can take care of in the summer and winter. There's competition over those tasks, and often the first worker to get to the job has an advantage over subsequent workers.&#10;&#10;Fortunately for the players, people love to visit wineries, and it just so happens that many of those visitors are willing to help out around the vineyard when they visit as long as you assign a worker to take care of them. Their visits (in the form of cards) are brief but can be very helpful.&#10;&#10;Using those workers and visitors, players can expand their vineyards by building structures, planting vines (vine cards), and filling wine orders (wine order cards). Players work towards the goal of running the most successful winery in Tuscany.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	6	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/WrnWFA1Sysm3-nQyBe1sUA__original/img/cGg9S0AH41VxczdybvFsb81AKWw=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2619743.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/WrnWFA1Sysm3-nQyBe1sUA__thumb/img/udscIXtuApQ6rFYHjfAM5zMKfFs=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2619743.jpg
471	27708	1960: The Making of the President	From the author:&#10;&#10;&quot;Sometimes the history of a nation can be defined by the relationship between two individuals. The Election of 1960 is the story of two men, John F. Kennedy and Richard M. Nixon. One is the scion of a wealthy, politically powerful family from New England. The other is the son of a Quaker grocer in Whittier, California. While they belong to opposing political parties, they start out as friends. The complex development of that friendship, however, would shape a pivotal presidential election and cast a long shadow over American history for the remainder of the 20th century.&#10;&#10;&quot;In 1960: The Making of the President, you take on the role of one of these great protagonists vying for the right to lead his country into the heart of the Cold War. However, it is not just foreign policy that poses a challenge to American leadership; this is also an era of great social turmoil and progress. As the United States continues to build upon the promise of its founding, candidates must contend with the question of civil rights and balance their positions on social justice against the need for valuable Southern electoral votes. Of course, the ever-present issue of the economy also rears its ugly head, and both Nixon and Kennedy will compete to be the candidate with the voters' pocket books in mind.&#10;&#10;&quot;The contest is fought out on an electoral map of the United States as it stood in 1960&mdash;a map where Louisiana and Florida share the same number of electoral votes, as do California and Pennsylvania. Using a card-driven game system, all the major events which shaped the campaign are represented: Nixon&rsquo;s lazy shave, President Eisenhower&rsquo;s late endorsement, and the 'Catholic question' are all included as specific event cards. The famous televised debates and final election day push are each handled with their own subsystems. Candidates vie to capture each state&rsquo;s electoral votes using campaign points in the four different regions of the country. At the same time, they must build momentum by dominating the issues of the day and attempt to gain control of the airwaves.&#10;&#10;&quot;As with any election campaign, the challenge is to adapt your game plan as the ground shifts out from under you. There are never enough resources or time to do everything, but you need to make the tough calls to propel yourself into the White House. This fast-playing strategy game for two players challenges you to run for the most powerful elective office in the world, at one of its most unique crossroads.

Gather your gun, your mount, and your grit as you forge your path into the history books.&#10;&#10;Western Legends is an open-world sandbox tabletop adventure for 2-6 players set in the American Wild West. Players assume the roles of historical figures of the era, earning their legendary status in a variety of ways: gamble, drive cattle, prospect for gold, rob the bank, fight bandits, pursue stories, become an outlaw, keep the peace. The possibilities are darn near endless.&#10;&#10;Each player's turn starts with drawing poker cards and/or gaining cash. Then they choose three actions. Possible actions include: move on the map (how far depends on whether they have a mount), doing a location-specific action (such as mine for gold if they are at a gold mine, gamble if they're in a saloon, etc.), fight other players at the same location (either duel them, rob them, or arrest them if they're wanted), play poker cards that have action abilities, etc. Legendary Points (LPs) are earned based on the outcomes of many of these actions, and the winner is whoever has the most LPs at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;Key Points&#10;- Award-winning gaming experience set in the American West!&#10;- Beautiful artwork, and presentation brings this highly thematic game to life.&#10;- Intuitive gameplay and choices lets you write your own legend every game!&#10;&#10;Note: The Russian edition of Western Legends contains two expansions packaged inside the box and thus has its own entry here: &#208;&#155;&#208;&#181;&#208;&#179;&#208;&#181;&#208;&#189;&#208;&#180;&#209;&#139; &#208;&#180;&#208;&#184;&#208;&#186;&#208;&#190;&#208;&#179;&#208;&#190; &#208;&#183;&#208;&#176;&#208;&#191;&#208;&#176;&#208;&#180;&#208;&#176;&#10;&#10;	\N	2	6	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/lZwgk3_MqyAmROjkz4v8Wg__original/img/W0gWMrkx5fEgVp8b2fMc-LfGmz8=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic6974323.png	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/lZwgk3_MqyAmROjkz4v8Wg__thumb/img/pI0Bnq7hO-Msonh7OJkKiHGnmfI=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6974323.png
474	305096	Endless Winter: Paleoamericans	Designed by Stan Kordonskiy (Dice Hospital, Rurik, Lock Up), developed by Jonny Pac (Coloma, Sierra West, Lions of Lydia), solo mode by Drake Villareal (Solani, Spook Manor), and illustrated by The Mico (Raiders of the North Sea, Paladins of the West Kingdom, Valeria),  Endless Winter: Paleoamericans takes place in North America, around 10,000 BCE. Players guide the development of their tribes across several generations&mdash;from nomadic hunter-gatherers to prosperous tribal societies. Over the course of the game, tribes migrate and settle new lands, establish cultural traditions, hunt paleolithic megafauna, and build everlasting megalithic structures.&#10;&#10;Endless Winter is a euro-style game that combines worker placement and deck building in an innovative way. Each round, players send their tribe members to various action spaces, and pay for the actions by playing cards and spending resources. Tribe cards grant additional labor, while Culture cards provide a variety of unique effects. As an alternative, cards can be saved for an end-of-round Eclipse phase, where they are simultaneously revealed to determine the new player order, and trigger various bonus actions.&#10;&#10;The game features a novel blend of interwoven systems and mechanisms, such as multi-use cards, area influence, tile placement, and set collection. Plus, there are many viable paths to victory. After four brisk rounds, scores are tallied, and the tribe with the most points wins!&#10;&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;	\N	1	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/TFX_awTwbJxoG74GtRHytw__original/img/plU9ZhUubz-1LHGfbsDstEOE9vg=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5624523.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/TFX_awTwbJxoG74GtRHytw__thumb/img/gUl5oqRjGtrEIBlTDCDnfm_m1Wg=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5624523.jpg
475	27833	Steam	In Steam you build railroads and deliver goods along an ever changing network of tracks and stations. You build the tracks, upgrade towns, improve your train, and grab the right goods to make the longest, most profitable deliveries. Score your deliveries and add to your income or victory points, balancing your need to invest against your quest to win the game.&#10;&#10;Steam contains a beautiful, double-sided game board. The map on each side depicts terrain, towns, and cities at the start of the railway age. The map of the northeastern USA and neighboring Canada is ideal for 3 or 4 players. Use the map of Europe's lower Rhine and Ruhr region when playing a 4 or 5 player game. You can play Steam on any number of current and future variant and expansion maps, so we include pieces for 6 players.&#10;&#10;The game plays very similarly to Age of Steam but with modifications to some of its mechanics and artwork. Tracks for income, train level, etc. are all printed on the board around the map such that alternate maps can be overlaid on the board and the necessary tracks will still be able to be used.&#10;&#10;Similar to:&#10;&#10;     Railways of the World&#10;&#10;&#10;	\N	3	5	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/IB38fOp0mTvFuvfdHczf0Q__original/img/SN5DSgS5Z0GOEzTBulGgX3faHCA=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic392515.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/IB38fOp0mTvFuvfdHczf0Q__thumb/img/UpyU-hvpdn3Q2b4Y486w2M3CO8I=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic392515.jpg
476	146508	T.I.M.E Stories	The T.I.M.E Agency protects humanity by preventing temporal faults and paradoxes from threatening the fabric of our universe. As temporal agents, you and your team will be sent into the bodies of beings from different worlds or realities to successfully complete the missions given to you. Failure is impossible, as you will be able to go back in time as many times as required.&#10;&#10;T.I.M.E Stories is a narrative game, a game of &quot;decksploration&quot;. Each player is free to give their character as deep a &quot;role&quot; as they want, in order to live through a story, as much in the game as around the table. But it's also a board game with rules which allow for reflection and optimization.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of the game, the players are at their home base and receive their mission briefing. The object is then to complete it in as few attempts as possible. The actions and movements of the players will use Temporal Units (TU), the quantity of which depend on the scenario and the number of players. Each attempt is called a &quot;run&quot;; one run equals the use of all of the Temporal Units at the players' disposal. When the TU reach zero, the agents are recalled to the agency, and restart the scenario from the beginning, armed with their experience. The object of the game is to make the perfect run, while solving all of the puzzles and overcoming all of a scenario&rsquo;s obstacles.&#10;&#10;You usually take possession of local hosts to navigate in a given environment, but who knows what you'll have to do to succeed? Roam a med-fan city, looking for the dungeon where the Syaan king is hiding? Survive in the Antarctic while enormous creatures lurk beneath the surface of the ice? Solve a puzzle in an early 20th century asylum? That is all possible, and you might even have to jump from one host to another, or play against your fellow agents from time to time.&#10;&#10;The base box contains the entirety of the T.I.M.E Stories system and allows players to play all of the scenarios, the first of which &mdash; Asylum &mdash; is included. During a scenario, which consists of a deck of 120+ cards, each player explores cards, presented most often in the form of a panorama. Access to some cards require the possession of the proper item or items, while others present surprises, enemies, riddles, clues, and other dangers. An insert allows players to &quot;save&quot; the game at any point, to play over multiple sessions, just like in a video game. This way, it's possible to pause your ongoing game by preserving the state of the receptacles, the remaining TU, the discovered clues, etc.&#10;&#10;--description from the publisher&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/XmwCsjQ3C1Ul53ZN2o8Q-Q__original/img/sUuboe9L4_nrIokyjAE74uklCjE=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic2617634.png	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/XmwCsjQ3C1Ul53ZN2o8Q-Q__thumb/img/tTU1YVtab-cN5gCdagINowvVA2g=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2617634.png
477	140620	Lewis & Clark: The Expedition	On November 30, 1803, the United States purchased Louisiana from Napoleon. U.S. President Thomas Jefferson decided to send two explorers &ndash; Meriwether Lewis and William Clark &ndash; to discover this huge terra incognita.&#10;&#10;Lewis &amp; Clark is a board game in which each player manages an expedition intended to cross the North American continent. Their goal is to be the first to reach the Pacific. Each one has his own Corps of Discovery that will be completed by the Native Americans and the trappers met during the journey. He has to cleverly manage his characters and also the resources he finds along the way. Beware, sometimes frugality is better than abundance.&#10;&#10;Lewis &amp; Clark features dual use cards. To be activated, one card must be combined with another one, which becomes unavailable for a while. Thus, players are faced with a constant dilemma: play a card or sacrifice it. During the game, each player acquires character cards that enlarge his hand, building a crew that gives him more options but it needs to be optimized as he will recycle his cards more slowly. This new &quot;handbuilding&quot; mechanism fits strongly with the historical background.&#10;&#10;Since the aim of the game is to be the first on the Pacific coast, the timing and the opportunistic use of the other players' positions are crucial.&#10;&#10;	\N	1	5	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/IiJ1JK6AjlSCKsC8U_DqMw__original/img/4W8ffc5xOvC6sl660XMGCBqkzJ8=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5375937.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/IiJ1JK6AjlSCKsC8U_DqMw__thumb/img/sRsfWxhyB9hPjkFVSE1y_W_AiP8=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5375937.jpg
478	127060	Bora Bora	Stake your fortunes in the mysterious island world of Bora Bora. Journey across islands, building huts where the resilient men and women of your tribes can settle, discovering fishing grounds and collecting shells. Send priests to the temples, and gather offerings to curry favor with the gods.&#10;&#10;In Bora Bora, players use dice to perform a variety of actions using careful insight and tactical planning. The heart of the game is its action resolution system in which 5-7 actions are available each round, the exact number depending on the number of players. Each player rolls three dice at the start of the round, then they take turns placing one die at a time on one action. Place a high number on an action, and you'll generally get a better version of that action: more places to build, more choices of people to take, better positioning on the temple track, and so on. Place a low number and you'll get a worse action &ndash; but you'll possibly block other players from taking the action at all as in order to take an action you must place a die on it with a lower number than any die already on the action.&#10;&#10;Three task tiles on a player's individual game board provide some direction as to what he might want to do, while god tiles allow for special actions and rule-breaking, as gods are wont to do. The player who best watches how the game develops and uses the most effective strategy will prevail.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/9YEjZIVdWVcUVWC7o8aKsQ__original/img/FmxZfRUytUU35lwbNkTetKJT6YM=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1542342.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/9YEjZIVdWVcUVWC7o8aKsQ__thumb/img/DvUZLxCdQsrU6uMqXnLU-ksIEJs=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1542342.jpg
479	204583	Kingdomino	In Kingdomino, you are a lord seeking new lands in which to expand your kingdom. You must explore all the lands, including wheat fields, lakes, and mountains, in order to spot the best plots, while competing with other lords to acquire them first.&#10;&#10;The game uses tiles with two sections, similar to Dominoes. Each turn, each player will select a new domino to connect to their existing kingdom, making sure at least one of its sides connects to a matching terrain type already in play. The order of who picks first depends on which tile was previously chosen, with better tiles forcing players to pick later in the next round. The game ends when each player has completed a 5x5 grid (or failed to do so), and points are counted based on number of connecting tiles and valuable crown symbols.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/3h9W8BfB_rltQ48EBmHliw__original/img/DDk3fDr0FkDpkYAcny5LeekB2qg=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic3132685.png	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/3h9W8BfB_rltQ48EBmHliw__thumb/img/RGpbcY90eBcNLXbHLMBwLrr2uzo=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3132685.png
480	155068	Arcadia Quest	In Arcadia Quest, players lead guilds of intrepid heroes on an epic campaign to dethrone the vampire lord and reclaim the mighty Arcadia for their own. But only one guild may lead in the end, so players must battle against each other as well as against the monstrous occupying forces.&#10;&#10;Arcadia Quest is a campaign-based game for 2 to 4 players, where each player controls a guild of three unique heroes, facing off against the other players and the various monsters controlled by the game. Players need to accomplish a series of quests in order to win each scenario and choose where to go next in the campaign.&#10;&#10;Players are able to choose the path their campaign takes, navigating through six out of eleven available scenarios, so each time the campaign is played it can have a different configuration of scenarios. As the campaign progresses, the heroes are able to acquire new weapons, equipment and abilities that give them powerful options to tackle the obstacles ahead. Furthermore, by fulfilling specific quests in a scenario, players unlock exclusive features in subsequent scenarios.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/8qyLCqvdZkSpT2lEbwVpeg__original/img/8oGnjG0FUHy9Mo6VkbZVXZmDnwU=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2305263.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/8qyLCqvdZkSpT2lEbwVpeg__thumb/img/ELrGgos0zEyITfKR5mpDokYKWAc=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2305263.jpg
481	760	Battle Line	Two opponents face off across a 'battle line' and attempt to win the battle by taking 5 of 9 flags or 3 adjacent flags. Flags are decided by placing cards into 3 card poker-type hands on either side of the flag (similar to straight flush, 3 of a kind, straight, flush, etc). The side with the highest 'formation' of cards wins the flag.&#10;&#10;This is a rethemed version of Schotten Totten with different graphics and wooden flag bits in place of the boundary stone cards.  Game play is identical, except the cards run from 1 to 10 (not 9), you hold seven cards in your hand (not 6), and the rule that stones may only be claimed at the start of your turn is presented as an &quot;advanced variant&quot;. Also the tactics cards were introduced by Battle Line; these cards were only added to later editions of Schotten-Totten.&#10;&#10;Some have reported that the production quality of the cards is inferior to the Schotten Totten cards, however, for most readers Battle Line will be much easier to find in stores.  In the second edition of GMT's Battle Line the card quality is higher.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	2	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/jhORjBZcaM22fWiLU946aQ__original/img/fKCKLR_MRvqI-JqJ69K1qFFO8aI=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic6975876.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/jhORjBZcaM22fWiLU946aQ__thumb/img/5yzJv24ws9p9g8C6XNpBAsYl8Y8=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6975876.jpg

483	144344	Rococo	Welcome to the Rococo era during the reign of Louis XV when it&rsquo;s safe to say that holding lavish balls is quite trendy. Important personalities wrap up in noble coats and dresses, anxious to outshine one another. As the biggest event is coming up in just a few weeks, everyone is turning to you with their requests: an elegant coat here, a stunning dress there, or a donation to fund the fireworks at the event. Soon you realize that it&rsquo;s not just about your dressmaking business anymore &mdash; it&rsquo;s about managing the most prestigious ball of the era&hellip;and now it&rsquo;s time to roc(k)!&#10;&#10;Rococo is a Eurostyle board game with an interesting take on deck-building. Each turn you play one of your employee cards and let that employee perform a task: hire a new employee, buy resources, manufacture a coat or dress, or invest in the ball&rsquo;s decorations. But not every employee is up to every task, so you must choose and lead your employees wisely &mdash; especially since each employee grants a unique bonus and some of these bonuses generate prestige points.&#10;&#10;After seven rounds, the game ends with the big ball and a final scoring. Then you gain prestige points for certain employee bonuses and for coats and dresses that you rent out to guests at the ball as well as for decorations that you funded. The player who collected the most prestige points wins.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	5	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Go8mEe3K1VjYFJxLXEUPqQ__original/img/RcJ7xX5K_y0G87nK5ttdcWeb10U=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1795272.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Go8mEe3K1VjYFJxLXEUPqQ__thumb/img/cclTiR7tkCqMj-TuFAaYfySFmH4=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1795272.jpg

485	92828	Dixit: Odyssey	Dixit Odyssey is both a standalone game and an expansion (Dixit: Odyssey (expansion)) for Jean-Louis Roubira's Dixit, which won Germany's Spiel des Jahres award in 2010.&#10;&#10;Game play in Dixit Odyssey matches that of Dixit: Each turn one player is the storyteller. This player secretly chooses one card in his hand, then gives a word or sentence to describe this card&mdash;but not too obviously. Each other player chooses a card in hand that matches this word/sentence and gives it to the storyteller. The storyteller then lays out the cards, and all other players vote on which card belongs to the storyteller. If no one or everyone guesses the storyteller's card, the storyteller receives no points and all players receive two; otherwise the storyteller and the correct guesser(s) each receive three points. Players score one point for each vote their image receives. Players refill their hands, and the next player becomes the storyteller. When the deck runs out, the player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;Dixit Odyssey contains 84 new cards, each with a unique image drawn by Pier&ocirc; and colored by Marie Cardouat, artist of Dixit and Dixit 2. The stand alone version also includes a folding game board, 6 new rabbit scoring tokens (12 total), and a box large enough to hold all the Dixit cards released to date. The stand alone version of Dixit Odyssey includes enough components for up to twelve players and also has variant rules for team play and for new ways to play with the cards.&#10;&#10;Expansion versus standalone versions of the game.&#10;&#10;     Standalone version is in a square box (released in 2011 but may still be available).&#10;     Expansion version is in a rectangular box (available from 2013 onwards): Dixit: Odyssey (expansion)&#10;&#10;&#10;	\N	3	12	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/7b75ZZJQ4EEbDsKLi6kYSw__original/img/Oep0CGYNB5HiLBBOMmEo2qKgXaM=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic918568.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/7b75ZZJQ4EEbDsKLi6kYSw__thumb/img/N0ZKQJsEo6_hk2UxH2rvqKorh2g=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic918568.jpg

492	256680	Return to Dark Tower	For an age, the tower lay in ruins. Unbeknownst to the people of the realm, a great evil stirred in its bowels. It started with strange sightings: a flock of crows flying in circles until they dropped from the sky, the lake frozen solid in the height of summer. In time, they could not deny that which they most feared.&#10;&#10;The evil had not been vanquished. The darkness would soon fall again. The tower will rise.&#10;&#10;A &quot;sequel&quot; to the 1981 grail game, Return to Dark Tower is a game for 1-4 players who take the role of heroes. Together, they gather resources, cleanse buildings, defeat monsters, and undertake quests to build up their strength and discern what foe ultimately awaits them. When the heroes face the tower, the game shifts into its dramatic second act, where the players have one chance to defeat the enemy once and for all.&#10;&#10;The game features both cooperative and competitive modes of play.&#10;&#10;The game features traditional game mechanisms, such as engine building and resource management, paired with a technological interface unlike any seen before in games, including the titular tower, which holds more than a few secrets.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;	\N	1	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/sd0acHeHj9RE-daXPC7pEg__original/img/G6dWPuaWJA9WtymikfcTGj_c4TA=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5153383.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/sd0acHeHj9RE-daXPC7pEg__thumb/img/ZDxL0mhIb3Rg8st8zCVZD9ngnf4=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5153383.jpg
487	108745	Seasons	The greatest sorcerers of the kingdom have gathered at the heart of the Argos forest, where the legendary tournament of the 12 seasons is taking place. At the end of the three year competition, the new archmage of the kingdom of Xidit will be chosen from among the competitors. Take your place, wizard! Equip your ancestral magical items, summon your most faithful familiars to your side and be ready to face the challenge!&#10;&#10;Seasons is a tactical game of cards and dice which takes place in two phases:&#10;&#10;The first phase &quot;Prelude&quot; consists of a card draft: the goal during this phase will be to establish your own 9-card deck for the main part of the game and with it the strategy.&#10;&#10;Once the Prelude is complete, each player must separate their 9 cards into 3 packs of 3 cards. They will begin the second phase of the game with their first pack of three cards, then gradually as the game progresses, they will receive the other two packets of three cards.&#10;&#10;Next comes the Tournament: at the beginning of each round a player will roll the seasons dice (dice = number of players +1).&#10;&#10;These cubes offer a variety of actions to the players: &#10;- Increase your gauge (maximum number of cards you may have placed on the table and in play) &#10;- Harvesting energy (water, earth, fire, air) to pay the cost of power cards&#10;- Crystallizing the energy (during the current season) to collect crystals. Crystals serve both as a resource to pay for some cards, but also as victory points in the end. &#10;- Draw new cards&#10;&#10;Each player can choose only one die per turn. The die not chosen by anyone determines how many fields the &quot;time track&quot; would move forward.&#10;In addition, all the dice are different depending on the season. For example, there are not the same energies to a particular season. Throughout the game, players will therefore have to adapt to these changes - also the &quot;exchange rates&quot; of energy to crystals vary during seasons - the energy not present on the dice in any given season is also the best paid during the season.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, the crystals are summed with victory points granted by the cards (minus some penalties, where applicable). The highest score wins.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/awmZ9rYy-hTgea6Vdp_OoQ__original/img/bQ_yFa_JI_B8y3N4nfXcXYU_tE0=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1299390.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/awmZ9rYy-hTgea6Vdp_OoQ__thumb/img/OBVCWq284XUhX2sKlMwoilFfuGk=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1299390.jpg
488	206718	Ethnos	In Ethnos, players call upon the support of giants, merfolk, halflings, minotaurs, and other fantasy tribes to help them gain control of the land. After three ages of play, whoever has collected the most glory wins!&#10;&#10;In more detail, the land of Ethnos contains twelve tribes of fantasy creatures, and in each game you choose six of them (five in a 2/3-player game), then create a deck with only the creatures in those tribes. The cards come in six colors, which match the six regions of Ethnos. Place three glory tokens in each region at random, arranging them from low to high.&#10;&#10;Each player starts the game with one card in hand, then 4-12 cards (double the number of players) are placed face up on the table. On a turn, a player either recruits an ally or plays a band of allies. In the former case, you take a face-up card (without replacing it from the deck) or the top card of the deck and add it to your hand. In the latter case, you choose a set of cards in your hand that match either in tribe or in color, play them in front of you on the table, then discard all other cards in hand. You then place one token in the region that matches the color of the top card just played, and you use the power of the tribe member on the top card just played.&#10;&#10;At the end of the first age, whoever has the most tokens in a region scores the glory shown on the first token. After the second age, the players with the most and second most tokens score glory equal to the values shown on the first and second tokens respectively. Players score similarly after the third age, then whoever has the most glory wins. (Games with two and three players last only two ages.)&#10;&#10;	\N	2	6	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/UIKUXkcnH3Bd4fjcPGINcA__original/img/IrqDqjjm1LY66Zkw7l4RwppaBBI=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic3304124.png	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/UIKUXkcnH3Bd4fjcPGINcA__thumb/img/oNhw2e_wcBc37ItkTRZVio2gMGQ=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3304124.png
489	2655	Hive	Hive is a strategic game for two players that is not restricted by a board and can be played anywhere on any flat surface. Hive is made up of twenty two pieces, eleven black and eleven white, resembling a variety of creatures each with a unique way of moving.&#10;&#10;With no setting up to do, the game begins when the first piece is placed down. As the subsequent pieces are placed this forms a pattern that becomes the playing surface (the pieces themselves become the board). Unlike other such games, the pieces are never eliminated and not all have to be played. The object of the game is to totally surround your opponent's queen, while at the same time trying to block your opponent from doing likewise to your queen. The player to totally surround his opponent's queen wins the game.&#10;&#10;&bull;&bull;&bull;&#10;&#10;Hive FAQ - please read before posting questions in the forum!&#10;&#10;	\N	2	2	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/fQe85tsBZoH6ibPnm1k1UA__original/img/eqUVrCJKcMBGBhw4Gfc9_9JabYE=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic791151.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/fQe85tsBZoH6ibPnm1k1UA__thumb/img/8ULXa8v7095ohgXMMmNlCGrC7zU=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic791151.jpg
490	24181	Imperial	From the rulebook:&#10;&#10;Europe in the age of imperialism. International investors try to achieve the greatest influence in Europe. With their bonds, they control the politics of the six imperial nations: Austria-Hungary, Italy, France, Great Britain, the German Empire, and Russia. The nations erect factories, build fleets, and deploy armies. The investors watch as their nations expand, wage wars, levy taxes, and collect the proceeds. Since the European nations are under the shifting influence of different investors, new strategic alliances and conflicts arise between them again and again!&#10;&#10;Each player represents an international investor. Only he who succeeds in increasing his capital and gaining influence in the most powerful European nations will win the imperial competition.&#10;&#10;Imperial is a varied strategy game without the luck of dice or cards. Two to six players, from about twelve years and up, take on the role of imperial investors. The duration of the game is about two to three hours.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	6	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/khAHJpItPCZTbLKY9vUUCg__original/img/3q0qApiQvFJXJ7wboLSpWCjDbYc=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic840712.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/khAHJpItPCZTbLKY9vUUCg__thumb/img/sDweGseAa80F7Cv_804-eE7KPco=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic840712.jpg
491	176734	The Manhattan Project: Energy Empire	From the ashes of war, nations rise to power in the atomic age. Each player takes control of a nation struggling for power in the latter part of the 20th century. They build up their nation&rsquo;s industry, commerce, and government by acquiring resources, building structures, and tapping sources of energy. The price of oil is going up, and nuclear energy is the wave of the future. The Manhattan Project: Energy Empire is set in the same &quot;universe&quot; as The Manhattan Project, but it's a standalone game, not an expansion.&#10;&#10;The major threat in Energy Empire is not war, but uncertain global impacts, that result from side effects of industrialization and pollution. Many actions come with a cost. So, as nations become more industrious, they also increase the amount of pollution in the environment.  Careful use of science can mitigate the harmful effects of industry, and can also help avert global crises.&#10;&#10;Energy Empire uses worker placement, tableau-building, and resource management mechanics. On each turn, a player can choose to either work or generate. On a work turn, a player plays a single worker on the main board, then uses workers and energy to activate cards in their tableau. Players may spend energy to use an occupied space on the main board, so no spaces are ever completely blocked. On a generate turn, players get to renew their supply of energy by rolling &quot;energy dice&quot; that represent nuclear, coal, oil, solar, and other forms of energy.&#10;&#10;	\N	1	5	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/-aaspZ2Oq1VuAADvbUoeww__original/img/fr4sH1ViKPtRys-gjCY4dY8UuQE=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3048617.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/-aaspZ2Oq1VuAADvbUoeww__thumb/img/6nMV_Bdtm2ShipBJfGle36DY1-U=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3048617.jpg

496	19777	Indonesia	Judging by the smirk on the face of the Sultan of Solo, the businessman from North Sumatra has just made a mistake. And a costly one at that, too. He has paid way too much for merging his rubber company with the Sultan&rsquo;s extensive rubber plantations: there are no ships in the area to transport the rubber to the booming cities of Java. And the Sultan is now dripping in cash &mdash; he can bribe city authorities so that his ships will gain preferential access to those ports where they are competing. Or he might invest in building an oil imperium. But wait &mdash; what&rsquo;s that young fellow over there up to? Buying all the shipping lines? That might change the outlook &hellip; considerably, in fact &hellip; let&rsquo;s see&hellip;&#10;&#10;Indonesia is a game in which two to five players build up an economy, trying to acquire the most money. Players acquire production companies, which produce goods (rice, spices, microwaveable meals, rubber, and oil), and shipping companies, which deliver goods to cities. As cities receive goods, they grow, increasing their demands. Production companies earn money for each good delivered to a city, up to the city's capacity, but they must pay shipping companies for the distance traveled, even if they end up losing money. Players can research advantages, like greater shipping capacity or the ability to merge companies, possibly stealing ownership of lucrative plantations or shipping routes by buying out other players.&#10;&#10;Players keep their money hidden, trying to accumulate the most by the end of the third era. When only one type of a company is left, an era ends. New eras bring new cities, companies, and types of goods. At the end of the third era, the player with the most money wins. However, money earned from the last round of operations (selling/shipping goods) counts double, so it can be important to control the timing.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	5	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/dMKwaRT7SYvukMuz6A8cxQ__original/img/ujxqaJuxawHp28WMvjv4JyUp0ac=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic93485.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/dMKwaRT7SYvukMuz6A8cxQ__thumb/img/RCh0FVF5BT9-ATms0Wc_6hs2z5I=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic93485.jpg

498	66589	Navegador	This game is inspired by the Portuguese Age of Discoveries in the 15th-16th century. Players take actions such as contracting men, acquiring ships and buildings, sailing the seas, establishing colonies in discovered lands, trading goods on the market, and getting privileges.&#10;&#10;Each player starts with only two ships and three workers and tries to expand his wealth.&#10;&#10;There are several undiscovered lands that allow players, once discovered, to found some colonies there. Colonies exist in different places where sugar, gold and spices are available and can be sold to the market to make some money. Money is used to build ships, erect buildings such as factories, shipyards and churches, and to get workers. Workers are necessary to found colonies or to acquire  buildings and privileges, which exist in five categories and therefore encourage players to follow different strategies competing with each other.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game the player who is most successful in combining his privileges with his achievements (colonies, factories, discoveries, shipyards, and churches) is the winner.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	5	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/rdZb15WqByPZzdTKEvNz0Q__original/img/Bfuphp_LyNR24k8Y4wLXjeUDdNs=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3246725.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/rdZb15WqByPZzdTKEvNz0Q__thumb/img/H49jq0-D4ceSoqO2c3ZGiNfkOH8=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3246725.jpg

The game is physically large, and includes sixty-four  figurines of the cultists, monsters, aliens, and Great Old Ones that range in height from approximately 20 mm to nearly 180 mm.&#10;&#10;The game takes place on a map of Earth. Each player takes the part of one of four factions included in the base game. At the start of a turn, players Gather Power, then, during a series of Action Rounds, they spend this Power to accomplish various tasks, such as recruiting Cultists, moving units, engaging in battle, summoning monsters, building Gates, casting spells, and Awakening their Great Old One. When all players run out of Power, the Action phase ends and the next turn begins. Victory is determined by accumulating points on the Doom Track. The first player to 30 is the lone victor *if* he has unlocked all six of spell books.&#10;&#10;Driving the strategy are a player's wish to expand his power base, and his need to accomplish six tasks to acquire his faction's spell books. Each faction has a unique set of monsters, spell books, and special abilities, and has different requirements to acquire its spell books. All factions have multiple strategies open to them.&#10;&#10;The base game supports 2-4 players (the map supports 5 players), but with new factions and maps released as expansions it can support up to 8 players.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/AUd4nmguSljr9qvkUCF2XQ__original/img/1wLZ2_huuT7TXul4uDxq7SsM5Ns=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3527761.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/AUd4nmguSljr9qvkUCF2XQ__thumb/img/YZMG9iA4STGd32xvQHgEjw5Fctg=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3527761.jpg

Wait for a huge double-sided game board presenting Europe and North America, newly customized wooden parts and an entire deck of new power plants, some of which use natural gas instead of garbage. New overview cards for the resource refill improve game play. An exciting new two players experience is also added - &ldquo;Against the Trust&rdquo;!&#10;&#10;The game is still Power Grid, with all the exciting auctions, the nerve-wracking resource speculations, city networks and the competition among the players, all the way to the tight game ending with several players fighting for the win.&#10;&#10;The goal of Power Grid Deluxe is to supply the most cities with power when someone's network reaches a predetermined size. Players mark pre-existing routes between cities for connection, then bid against each other to purchase the power plants that they need to power these cities. However, as power plants are purchased, newer, more efficient plants become available, so by merely purchasing, you're potentially allowing others access to superior equipment.&#10;&#10;What's more, players must acquire the resources (coal, oil, natural gas, and uranium) needed to power said plants (except for the &quot;renewable&quot; windfarm plants, which require no fuel), making it a constant struggle to upgrade your plants for maximum efficiency while still retaining enough wealth to quickly expand your network to get the cheapest routes.&#10;&#10;NOTE: The deluxe edition came with Power Grid: The New Power Plants &#226;&#128;&#147; Set 2, which was later released separately in 2021.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	6	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/pTnv3lUWs4Knl3fqer0KnA__original/img/Sna_LGQ8KH3Zz6VjEAn-YQ-8yJw=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2056160.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/pTnv3lUWs4Knl3fqer0KnA__thumb/img/lUr_hvOoCfzI9JvplDge3L1Edx4=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2056160.jpg

Well, we forgot to mention that those petz are for Dungeon Lords.

The game consists of several rounds in which players use unusual worker placement mechanisms (players simultaneously prepare different sized groups of imps in order to play sooner than others) to prepare themselves for the uneasy task of raising creature cubs and pleasing their different needs (represented by cards) in order to sell them as grown and scary creatures to Dungeon Lords.

As the businesses grow with tile placements, they also start merging, giving the majority stockholders of the acquired business sizable bonuses, which can then be used to reinvest into other chains.  All of the investors in the acquired company can then cash in their stocks for current value or trade them 2-for-1 for shares of the newer, larger business.  The game is a race to acquire the greatest wealth.&#10;&#10;History of Acquire: This Sid Sackson classic has taken many different forms over the years depending on the publisher, yet the rules and game play have stayed the same. The 1966 version of the 3M bookshelf edition included rules for a 2-player variant. The original version is part of the 3M Bookshelf Series.&#10;&#10;Many books and websites incorrectly list this as a 1962 publication as the 3M Company used previously copyrighted artwork when they released the game in 1964. 3M actually received the idea for the game of &quot;Vacations&quot; from Sid Sackson in May of 1963 and decided to take his idea and put it into artwork they had developed the year before for a game called &quot;ACQUIRE.&quot; 3M's original game idea for a game called ACQUIRE must not have been very good so they decided to take Sid's idea of Vacations and put it into their concept of ACQUIRE. They released some limited test market games in 8 Midwestern U.S. cities in December of 1963 with a box that had a 1963 copyright. These games had Sid's original rules. When 3M released the mass market games in 1964, they had taken liberties with some of Sid's original ideas and changed some rules and game play to match their production desires. They released them with outer boxes that were copyrighted 1962 and inner boxes with rules that were dated 1963.&#10;&#10;December 1963 - Test Market World Map Wood Tile Edition&#10;1964 - Dated 1962/63 wood tiles, chipboard with plastic overlay &amp; stocks with printed backs&#10;1965 - Dated 1962/63 plastic tiles, chipboard with plastic overlay &amp; stocks with printed backs (last edition made with printed backs until 1999)&#10;1966 - Dated 1962/66 plastic tiles, chipboard with plastic overlay &amp; non-wax coated stocks (Only edition with these stocks)&#10;1968 - Dated 1968/66 plastic tiles, clear plastic board with paper underlay (Both 1966 inner box games have a lot of mixed parts)&#10;1971 - Dated 1968/71 plastic tiles, yellow hard plastic board&#10;1975 - 3M sells rights for game of ACQUIRE to the Avalon Hill Company&#10;1976 - Dated 1976 plastic tiles, yellow hard plastic board, redesigned money, no inner box (This edition was also produced in 1977, 79, 81, 82,       &amp; 86)&#10;1989 - Dated 1976 Gray box edition with new box artwork same contents as regular 1976 editions (This edition was also produced in 1992)&#10;1995 - Dated 1995 Large box cardboard edition with chipboard board and tiles, Special Powers Variant Tiles inspired by German editions&#10;1997 - Avalon Hill sells the rights to the game of ACQUIRE to Hasbro&#10;1999 - Dated 1999 Large box with large plastic board and tiles, 3D company buildings, redesigned stocks &amp; money, large info cards&#10;2006 - Hasbro assigns rights for the game of ACQUIRE to their subsidiary, Wizards of the Coast&#10;2006 - Lloyd's (private) Rules of ACQUIRE are made public, two major rule changes that help to bring the balance of the game of ACQUIRE back to the  intentions of Sid Sackson's original ideas. Lloyd Solon's Rules help players to correct poor strategy during the beginning of the game that can been seen with new and unexperienced players (running out of money soon is the main mistake that must be omitted!).  &#10;2008 - Dated 2008 cardboard edition with chipboard board &amp; tiles, redesigned stocks &amp; money&#10;2016 - Dated 2016 The current affordable mass-market edition. It looks at first sight to be similar to previous modern editions, but has been criticised for the use of inferior design choices such as hard-to-read grey-on-grey embossed slots and the unusual tile fonts. It contains modified rules and a slightly smaller playing grid. Although these changes have been criticised for not ultimately improving upon Sackson's original design, they are generally regarded as not being too damaging to it.&#10;2023 - Renegade Game Studio partners with Hasbro, and releases their new version, with Classic Mode or Tycoon Mode &mdash; play with or without tertiary stockholder merger bonus.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	6	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/FfguJeknahk88vKT7C3JLA__original/img/9xV86q5SLQAJtOsr0KKw5G6UOMM=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic7376875.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/FfguJeknahk88vKT7C3JLA__thumb/img/cpf23VxElZxuYaIGcgrjPn80sZY=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7376875.jpg
504	160477	Onitama	Onitama is a two-player, perfect information abstract game with a random starting set-up. On a 5x5 board, both players start with five pawns on their side, with the main pawn in the middle.&#10;&#10;Each player has two open cards that each display a possible move for any of her pieces. There is a fifth card that cannot be used by either player. On a player's turn, she chooses one of her cards, moves one of her pieces according to the chosen card, then replaces the card she used with the fifth card. The other player then chooses one of his cards, moves accordingly, and exchanges that card with this fifth card &mdash; which is, of course, the card the first player just used.&#10;&#10;Moving onto one of the opponent's pawns removes that pawn from the game. Taking the opponent's main pawn, or moving your main pawn into your opponent's main pawn's starting space, wins you the game.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	2	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/GJKuOCy5HGAYgVH_Rei5mA__original/img/oRsIxp72iv58128KFdqvjG6Gz64=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic7070194.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/GJKuOCy5HGAYgVH_Rei5mA__thumb/img/Q3W4poMS4btD-HZLervgqbSCtmE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7070194.jpg
505	38453	Space Alert	Space Alert is a cooperative team survival game. Players become crew members of a small spaceship scanning dangerous sectors of the galaxy. The missions last just 10 real-time minutes (hyperspace jump, sector scan, hyperspace jump back) and the only task the players have is to protect their ship.&#10;&#10;During play, the central computer will announce the presence of various threats on one of the supplied 10 minute soundtracks that also acts as a game timer. The threats vary from space battleships and interceptors to different interstellar monsters and abominations, asteroids or even intruders and malfunctions on the spaceship. Players have to agree who will take care of which task and coordinate their actions (moving around the ship, firing weapons, distributing energy, using battlebots to deal with intruders, launching guided missiles, etc.) in real time to defend the ship. Only a well-working team can survive 10 minutes and make the jump back to safety.&#10;&#10;The game offers several difficulty levels, huge variability and a unique experience for one to five player teams. One mission lasts only about 30 minutes, including setup and evaluation.&#10;&#10;(Based on a description from Czech Games Edition)&#10;&#10;	\N	1	5	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/tinE1f2lauIsEL4aC9aU-w__original/img/ccy5tGJK7WF9B6ykayJEm5cReTM=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic384313.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/tinE1f2lauIsEL4aC9aU-w__thumb/img/9tewdwxUKcqikj0QlVSUmwRPK68=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic384313.jpg
506	291572	Oath: Chronicles of Empire & Exile	In Oath, one to six players guide the course of history in an ancient land. Players might take the role of agents bolstering the old order or scheme to bring the kingdom to ruin. The consequences of one game will ripple through those that follow, changing what resources and actions future players may have at their disposal and even altering the game's core victory condition.&#10;&#10;If a player seizes control by courting anarchy and distrust, future players will have to contend with a land overrun by thieves and petty warlords. In a later game, a warlord might attempt to found a dynasty, creating a line of rulers that might last generations or be crushed by the rise of a terrible, arcane cult.&#10;&#10;In Oath, there are no fancy production tricks, app-assisted mechanisms or production gimmicks. The game can be reset at any time and doesn't require the same play group from one game to the next. A player might use the fully-featured solo mode to play several generations during the week and then use that same copy of the game for Saturday game-night with friends. There are no scripted narratives or predetermined end points. The history embedded in each copy of Oath will grow to be as unique as the players who helped build it.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;	\N	1	6	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/gTxav_KKQK1rDg-XuCjCSA__original/img/lG-iXVzDlfFrD6VPggvg2WQ7228=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5164812.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/gTxav_KKQK1rDg-XuCjCSA__thumb/img/tFTOAKG5aDXxYfNRmJNmfyxH83M=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5164812.jpg
507	323612	Bitoku	In Bitoku, the players take on the roles of Bitoku spirits of the forest in their path towards transcendence, with the goal of elevating themselves and becoming the next great spirit of the forest. To do so, they will have the help of the y&#197;&#141;kai, the kodamas and the different pilgrims that accompany them on their path. This is a hand-management, engine-building game with multiple paths to victory.&#10;&#10;Players will have y&#197;&#141;kai represented by the cards that make up their hand, which must be placed in the right places at the right times in order to obtain the maximum benefit from the abilities they offer. Furthermore, during the game players can earn more y&#197;&#141;kai cards for their deck, thereby increasing their playing options and achieving a higher score. Each player also has three y&#197;&#141;kai guardians (in the form of dice) that they can send to the large regions of the forest on the main board in order to obtain all kinds of new options that they can play during the game. These options can be structures they build in certain areas of the forest, soul crystals that generate resources when certain actions are carried out, and many others as well. The players also have the chance to help the mitamas, lost souls in search of redemption by using the chinkon fireflies.&#10;&#10;There is truly a wide range of actions to carry out, and this is without taking into account the personal domain where the players can lay out another layer of additional strategy while managing the pilgrims. Pilgrims are followers of the player who embark upon journeys of contemplation and reflection who then share the experiences and learning they can along the spirit path with the Bitoku.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;	\N	1	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/sMP4YfVfwv6vvh_y7EcXzA__original/img/SdMc8sjTpcN8I15uZ_RmKdhLIkY=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic6182978.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/sMP4YfVfwv6vvh_y7EcXzA__thumb/img/FelEz-syYFGhxLBVeXG_SQPCWRQ=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6182978.jpg

535	13122	Antiquity	From the Manufacturer:&#10;&#10;&quot;These fields no longer yield grain the way they used to,&quot; complains the farmer. &quot;We should settle new lands before our food runs out. Why don't we start farming olives, like our neighbors?&quot;&#10;&#10;The cart-driver nods: &quot;Ever since them city folks started worshiping San Giorgio I have to travel further and further to new building sites. I'm on my way now to the new inn they built. I'll change horses there and deliver this load,&quot; he gestures towards the pile of wood in the cart with his head &quot;to the sea beyond. Gonna start some fisheries there. It is said we'll conquer those olive-farmers before long. But their land is even more polluted than ours.&quot;&#10;&#10;The farmer nods his head in reply. As the cart starts moving again, he returns to the field to harvest the last bushels of grain, growing between the stumps of what used to be a lush forest -- three turns ago.&#10;&#10;Antiquity is a strategy game for 2-4 players. It is set in an environment loosely modeled on Italy in the late Middle Ages. Players choose their own victory condition: they can focus on population growth, trade, conquest, or city building by choosing their patron saint.&#10;&#10;Each strategy requires a completely different style of play. Or you can choose to adore Santa Maria, the most powerful saint of all -- but you'll be expected to build a civilization twice as impressive as any other player.&#10;&#10;While your economy is constantly improving, with more and more advanced cities bringing new options each turn, the land around your cities is slowly being depleted, forcing you to travel further and further to gather your raw materials -- until finally, there is no more land left to farm. Let's hope one of you has won the game before that time!&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/CDORbD8KPxSXBaJrdHtN2Q__original/img/HrJb-K0d3SXsJfACbpsOiv6Lutc=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic3731052.png	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/CDORbD8KPxSXBaJrdHtN2Q__thumb/img/msitlnovDr7wZinoLdFSBFTLMiA=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3731052.png
509	154203	Imperial Settlers	Settlers from four major powers of the world have discovered new lands, with new resources and opportunities. Romans, Barbarians, Egyptians and Japanese all at once move there to expand the boundaries of their empires. They build new buildings to strengthen their economy, they found mines and fields to gather resources, and they build barracks and training grounds to train soldiers. Soon after they discover that this land is far too small for everybody, then the war begins...&#10;&#10;Imperial Settlers is a card game that lets players lead one of the four factions and build empires by placing buildings, then sending workers to those buildings to acquire new resources and abilities. The game is played over five rounds during which players take various actions in order to explore new lands, build buildings, trade resources, conquer enemies, and thus score victory points.&#10;&#10;The core mechanism of Imperial Settlers is based on concepts from the author's card game 51st State.&#10;&#10;	\N	1	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/pRwsvyfsRJ-lWWwVJCdXNg__original/img/Cw8O-7dOaO1sZRy95QGImdSm7p8=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2871265.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/pRwsvyfsRJ-lWWwVJCdXNg__thumb/img/-b7sYBaUVxdZ_a33QRfvJY2ccAk=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2871265.jpg

Combat is more streamlined and decisive, and new rumor tokens allow Dracula to mislead hunters and extend the terrible reach of his influence. Count Dracula triumphs if he advances his influence track to thirteen; if the hunters can defeat him before then, they save the continent of Europe and win the game.&#10;&#10;The fourth edition of Fury of Dracula contains pre-painted miniatures instead of unpainted figures, a different rulebook and different card sizes.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	5	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/iLiUp891Wqb5EE0gBqjBaA__original/img/XowehLK_AtTFigFRNeLqCMmVXNo=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4411188.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/iLiUp891Wqb5EE0gBqjBaA__thumb/img/Jg01alIAt8H1KI6gFhS-naLJans=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4411188.jpg
511	143693	Glass Road	The game Glass Road commemorates the 700-year-old tradition of glass-making in the Bavarian Forest. (Today, the &quot;Glass Road&quot; is a route through the Bavarian forest that takes visitors to many of the old glass houses and museums of that region.) You must skillfully manage your glass and brick production in order to build the right structures that help you keep your business flowing. Cut the forest to keep the fires burning in the ovens, and spread and remove ponds, pits, and groves to supply yourself with the items you need. Fifteen specialists are there at your side to carry out your orders...&#10;&#10;In more detail, the game consists of four building periods. Each player has an identical set of fifteen specialist cards, and each specialist comes with two abilities. At the beginning of each building period, you choose a hand of five specialists. If during this building period, you play a specialist that no other player has in hand, you may use both abilities on that card; if two or more players play the same specialist, each of them may use only one of the two abilities. Exploiting the abilities of these specialists lets you collect resources, lay out new landscape tiles (e.g., ponds and pits), and build a variety of buildings, which come in three types:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Processing buildings&#10;    &quot;Immediate&quot; buildings with a one-time effect &#10;    Buildings that provide bonus points at the end of the game for various accomplishments&#10;&#10;&#10;Mastering the balance of knowing the best specialist card to play and being flexible about when you play it &mdash; together with assembling a clever combination of buildings &mdash; is the key to this game.&#10;&#10;The 2021 edition of Glass Road includes previously released promotional material: the Oktoberfest and Adventskalender tiles and the Harlekin card for use in the solitaire version of the game.&#10;&#10;	\N	1	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/qJCgEh5Icl7Ed1z2F56yxg__original/img/uz0zO0sycM6HZNA3HTWW7-_ur_Y=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5895433.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/qJCgEh5Icl7Ed1z2F56yxg__thumb/img/yGVr4jO888pg1GmCnukXbubTZmM=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5895433.jpg

But most notoriously, they summon their great race's hordes of warriors to the battlefield, to clash in the never-ending struggle for supremacy. A Summoner is both mage and general, and must combine their wizardly might with clever tactics to defeat the enemy Summoner on the opposite side of the battle.&#10;&#10;The Summoner Wars Master Set contains six new and different complete factions from which to choose:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Play as the Shadow Elves and conceal your plans in swirling darkness!&#10;     Choose the Benders and confound your foe, turning his own troops against him!&#10;     Command the Vargath, mountainous goatfolk who call lightning from the heavens!&#10;     Select the nefarious Sand Goblins and delight in malicious trickery!&#10;     Muster the Deep Dwarves and control the forces of Geomancy!&#10;     Lead the ferocious Swamp Orcs to war and hack upon your foes as they are snared in your vines! &#10;&#10;&#10;Strategy shapes the composition of each deck of cards and how they are used.

However, absolute power corrupts absolutely, and Mind MGMT is now rotting from the inside.

How can this enigmatic organization, hell bent on global domination, be defeated?&#10;&#10;Thankfully, a few renegade agents have figured out that Mind MGMT has been compromised and have defected, turning their backs on the syndicate. They now use their own psychic abilities to prevent Mind MGMT from achieving its nefarious goals.&#10;&#10;In Mind MGMT: The Psychic Espionage &quot;Game.&quot;, one player controls Mind MGMT and must scour the city for new recruits.

They fight over control of neutral land and sea areas in order to become the most powerful nation worldwide.&#10;&#10;In this game it is not the players who take turns, but the six powers, one after another.  The players are just internationally operating investors who act in the background.  By giving money to the six powers, which all have their own treasuries, the players influence the politics.  The biggest investor in each nation gains control of that nation's government and decides what the nation will do.  As control of a government can change with each new investment, players may control several governments at the same time.  As investors, players should not get too attached to their preferred nation, but rather focus on where their investments have the best rates of return.  Essentially the game is about money, and not about military domination!&#10;&#10;Imperial 2030 was released at Essen 2009 by PD-Games and Rio Grande Games. Compared to &quot;Imperial&quot; there will be some new features:&#10;- new wooden bits&#10;- the Swiss Bank &#10;- a new 30 million bond to invest in&#10;- more neutral territory, generating higher taxation&#10;- fewer home provinces&#10;- control of canals (Panama and Suez).&#10;&#10;For those who already owned Imperial, there was the opportunity to get only the new map and bonds at Essen '09, as it can be played with the old wooden bits as well.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	6	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/YSopSx1x5iea7qI21ogYBw__original/img/BTpxWEL57yDfISpu-WZdfzX6Di0=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic586346.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/YSopSx1x5iea7qI21ogYBw__thumb/img/9pIX4JJydy15FHCDrdwtdbXRAFk=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic586346.jpg

It&rsquo;s a celebration to end all celebrations in the aftermath of the War to End All Wars.&#10;&#10;Yet a dark shadow grows in the city of Arkham. Alien entities known as Ancient Ones lurk in the emptiness beyond space and time, writhing at the thresholds between worlds.

521	48726	Alien Frontiers	Do you have what it takes to be a deep space colonist?  An alien frontier awaits the brave and daring!  This new planet will be harsh, but if you have the skills to manage your resources, build a fleet, research alien life, and settle colonies, the world can be yours.&#10;&#10;Alien Frontiers is a game of resource management and planetary development for two to four players. During the game you will utilize orbital facilities and alien technology to build colony domes in strategic locations to control the newly discovered world.&#10;&#10;The game board shows the planet, its moon, the stations in orbit around the planet, and the solar system&rsquo;s star. The dice you are given at the start of the game represent the space ships in your fleet. You will assign these ships to the orbital facilities in order to earn resources, expand your fleet, and colonize the planet.&#10;&#10;As the game progresses, you will place your colony tokens on the planet to represent the amount of control you have over each territory. Those territories exert influence over specific orbital facilities and, if you control a territory, you are able to utilize that sway to your advantage.&#10;&#10;The planet was once the home of an alien race and they left behind a wondrous artifact in orbit. Using your fleet to explore the artifact, you will discover amazing alien technologies that you can use to advance your cause.&#10;&#10;Winning the game will require careful consideration as you assign your fleet, integrate the alien technology and territory influences into your expansion plans, and block your opponents from building colonies of their own. Do you have what it takes to conquer an alien frontier?&#10;&#10;Roll and place your dice to gain advantages over your opponent and block them out of useful areas of the board.  Use Alien Tech cards to manipulate your dice rolls and territory bonuses to break the rules.  Steal resources, overtake territories, and do whatever it takes to get your colonies on the map first!  Don't dream it'll be easy, though, because the other players will be trying to do the same thing.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/UWZTWLXFfg_6HpXJmviL3g__original/img/1EiMWmB4iGMDRbaXuvZQtlszM_Q=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic3360924.png	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/UWZTWLXFfg_6HpXJmviL3g__thumb/img/KBuRMq00g4PlosEQSUUTDLzsYN8=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3360924.png
522	2653	Survive: Escape from Atlantis!	Survive is a cutthroat game where players seek to evacuate their pieces from an island that is breaking up, while remembering where their highest-valued pieces are located to maximize their score.&#10;&#10;An island made up of 40 hex-tiles is slowly sinking into the ocean (as the tiles are removed from the board). Each player controls ten people (valued from 1 to 6) that they try and move towards the safety of the surrounding islands before the main island finally blows up. Players can either swim or use boats to travel but must avoid sea serpents, whales and sharks on their way to safety.&#10;&#10;Survive is very similar to Escape from Atlantis with some key differences.&#10;&#10;Survive was reprinted as &quot;Survive: Escape from Atlantis!&quot; by publisher Stronghold Games and hit store shelves in February, 2011.

525	129622	Love Letter	All of the eligible young men (and many of the not-so-young) seek to woo the princess of Tempest. Unfortunately, she has locked herself in the palace, and you must rely on others to take your romantic letters to her. Will yours reach her first?&#10;&#10;Love Letter is a game of risk, deduction, and luck for 2&ndash;4 players.

526	136888	Bruges	Bruges in the 15th century &ndash; culture and commerce flourish and make the Belgian Hanseatic city into one of the wealthiest cities in Europe.&#10;&#10;In Bruges (a.k.a. Brugge or Br&uuml;gge depending on the country in which you live), players assume the role of merchants who must maintain their relationships with those in power in the city while competing against one another for influence, power, and status. Dramatic events cast their shadows over the city, with players needing to worry about threats to their prosperity from more than just their opponents...&#10;&#10;The game includes 165 character cards, with each card having one of five colors. On a turn, a player chooses one of his cards and performs an action, with six different actions being available: Take workers, take money, mitigate a threat, build a canal, build a house, or hire the character depicted on the card. In principle, every card can be used for every action &ndash; but the color of the card determines in which areas the actions can be used or the strength of the chosen action, e.g., blue cards provide blue workers and red cards help mitigate red threats. All of the action is geared toward the gathering of prestige, with the most prestigious merchant winning in the end.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/A8JeebUT3mu4zUmYs9clDQ__original/img/v5d03Jz4di-I6S6C1iihj6JEeoY=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1652004.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/A8JeebUT3mu4zUmYs9clDQ__thumb/img/0O-Yp8KcLpb_lUXGm3AgymPJKos=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1652004.jpg
527	50	Lost Cities	Lost Cities is a card game in the Kosmos two-player series. The game originally consisted of a single deck of cards of rank 2&ndash;10 in five different colors with three special &quot;handshakes&quot; (&quot;HS&quot; in scoring examples below) in each suit, but as of 2019 the game now includes six colored suits, with the sixth color being optional for gameplay. A game board is included to organize discarded cards and help players organize their card collections.&#10;&#10;The object of the game is to gain points by mounting profitable archaeological expeditions to the different sites represented by the colored suits of cards. On a player's turn, they must first play one card, either to an expedition or by discarding it to the color-appropriate discard pile, then draw one card, either from the deck or from the top of a discard pile. Cards played to expeditions must be in ascending order, but they need not be consecutive. Handshakes are considered lower than a 2 and represent investments in an expedition. Thus, if you play a red 4, you may play any other red card higher than a 4 on a future turn but may no longer play a handshake, the 2, or the 3.&#10;&#10;The game continues in this fashion with players alternating turns until the final card is taken from the deck. The rest of the cards in hand are then discarded and players score their expeditions. Each expedition that has at least one card played into it must be scored. Cards played into an expedition are worth their rank in points, and handshakes count as a multiplier against your final total; one handshake doubles an expedition's value, while two handshakes triples that value and three handshakes quadruple it. Expeditions start at a value of -20, so you must play at least 20 points of cards into an expedition in order to make a profit. If you are left with a negative value and have a handshake, the multiplier still applies. A 20-point bonus is awarded to every expedition with at least eight cards played into it. A complete game of Lost Cities lasts three matches, with scores for each match being added together.&#10;&#10;Scoring example 1: An expedition has a 2,3,7,8,10 for a total of 30. This expedition is worth 10 total points: 30 plus the initial -20.&#10;&#10;Scoring example 2: An expedition has 2 HS, and 4,5,6,7,8,10 for a total of 40. This expedition is worth 80 total points: 40 points for cards, plus the initial -20, &times;3 for the two multipliers, plus the 20-pt bonus for playing 8+ cards.&#10;&#10;Scoring example 3: An expedition has 1 HS, and 4,6,7 for a total of 17. This expedition is worth -6 total points: 17 plus the initial -20, &times;2 for the multiplier.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	2	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/AL5D-dXabY-Lk3PqIFk_0g__original/img/PdGBQ7xc0GA9ndKnnInx_sQwvl4=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4597095.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/AL5D-dXabY-Lk3PqIFk_0g__thumb/img/Q-76aN92M3OveMp26t7b0i7V-i4=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4597095.jpg

The rules are the same as the &Uuml;berplay edition, with the exception of the rounding rule (which was stated in different ways in different printings of the &Uuml;berplay edition).&#10;&#10;Rounding rule&#10;&#10;The rounding rule preferred by the designer Stefan Dorra is that players get back half of their bid rounded DOWN (not UP), as confirmed in correspondence with him here and here.

But as soon as you had the first hut built, you discovered a vast network of caverns underground, brimming with shiny treasures, rare resources, and untold adventure. How could you limit your new village to the surface? You immediately start organizing expeditions and building houses underground as well as on the surface.&#10;&#10;With any luck, you'll build a village even stronger than your last-- strong enough, even, to turn away the barbarians the next time they come knocking.&#10;&#10;Above and Below is a mashup of town-building and storytelling where you and up to three friends compete to build the best village above and below ground. In the game, you send your villagers to perform jobs like exploring the cave, harvesting resources, and constructing houses. Each villager has unique skills and abilities, and you must decide how to best use them. You have your own personal village board, and you slide the villagers on this board to various areas to indicate that they've been given jobs to do. Will you send Hanna along on the expedition to the cave? Or should she instead spend her time teaching important skills to one of the young villagers?&#10;&#10;A great cavern lies below the surface, ready for you to explore-- this is where the storytelling comes in. When you send a group of villagers to explore the depths, one of your friends reads what happens to you from a book of paragraphs. You'll be given a choice of how to react, and a lot will depend on which villagers you brought on the expedition, and who you're willing to sacrifice to succeed. The book of paragraphs is packed with encounters of amazing adventure, randomly chosen each time you visit the cavern.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, the player with the most well-developed village wins!&#10;&#10;The Kickstarter version of the game included the following items which are not found in the Retail version:&#10;&#10;     Villager Tool tokens&#10;     Lost Villagers&#10;     Swamp Villagers&#10;     Exclusive Stretch goals:&#10;     Creature Villagers&#10;     Quest Tokens&#10;     Underforest Tokens and PDF story book&#10;     Desert Labyrinth tokens and PDF story book &#10;     Wooden Goods&#10;&#10;&#10;This collection of items can be found in Above and Below: Expanded Edition Exclusives&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/U0wpvRmBe65e4vwGf0Jbpg__original/img/gIlpowYQ7XzumYO0jZyVldxosBA=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2398773.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/U0wpvRmBe65e4vwGf0Jbpg__thumb/img/jHLwKKWiJ-lHoaNIj0TrKAGm7QM=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2398773.jpg
541	40692	Small World	In Small World, players vie for conquest and control of a world that is simply too small to accommodate them all.&#10;&#10;Designed by Philippe Keyaerts as a fantasy follow-up to his award-winning Vinci, Small World is inhabited by a zany cast of characters such as dwarves, wizards, amazons, giants, orcs, and even humans, who use their troops to occupy territory and conquer adjacent lands in order to push the other races off the face of the earth.&#10;&#10;Picking the right combination from the 14 different fantasy races and 20 unique special powers, players rush to expand their empires - often at the expense of weaker neighbors. Yet they must also know when to push their own over-extended civilization into decline and ride a new one to victory!&#10;&#10;On each turn, you either use the multiple tiles of your chosen race (type of creatures) to occupy adjacent (normally) territories - possibly defeating weaker enemy races along the way, or you give up on your race letting it go &quot;into decline&quot;. A race in decline is designated by flipping the tiles over to their black-and-white side.&#10;&#10;At the end of your turn, you score one point (coin) for each territory your races occupy. You may have one active race and one race in decline on the board at the same time. Your occupation total can vary depending on the special abilities of your race and the territories they occupy. After the final round, the player with the most coins wins.&#10;&#10;Clarifications: available in a pinned forum post.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	5	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/aoPM07XzoceB-RydLh08zA__original/img/bYLzrwZO9u-3h2wyU-PHc8aTOY4=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic428828.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/aoPM07XzoceB-RydLh08zA__thumb/img/o3Bw9heVDJRgPYlI_PksCvLAgnM=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic428828.jpg
542	140934	Arboretum	Arboretum is a strategy card game for 2-4 players, aged 10 and up, that combines set collection, tile-laying and hand management while playing in about 25 minutes. Players try to have the most points at the end of the game by creating beautiful garden paths for their visitors.&#10;&#10;The deck has 80 cards in ten different colors, with each color featuring a different species of tree; each color has cards numbered 1 through 8, and the number of colors used depends on the number of players. Players start with a hand of seven cards. On each turn, a player draws two cards (from the deck or one or more of the discard piles), lays a card on the table as part of her arboretum, then discards a card to her personal discard pile.&#10;&#10;When the deck is exhausted, players compare the cards that remain in their hands to determine who can score each color. For each color, the player(s) with the highest value of cards in hand of that color scores for a path of trees in her arboretum that begins and ends with that color; a path is a orthogonally adjacent chain of cards with increasing values. For each card in a path that scores, the player earns one point; if the path consists solely of trees of the color being scored, the player scores two points per card. If a player doesn't have the most value for a color, she scores zero points for a path that begins and ends with that color. Whoever has the most points wins.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/XYOn10oXBrDqHySf0jvnyQ__original/img/RMi0pEsP8agfH-tgYkeRGilD3oo=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic4172124.png	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/XYOn10oXBrDqHySf0jvnyQ__thumb/img/X6V1M2nZOinTgwE0KIBfup_QrCw=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4172124.png
543	374173	Star Wars: The Deckbuilding Game	The Rebel Alliance fights valiantly against the tyranny of the Galactic Empire. Each new victory brings the Rebels hope, and each heroic sacrifice strengthens their resolve. Still, the Empire's resources are vast, and the firepower of its Empire Navy is unmatched. With neither side willing to accept defeat, their war rages across the galaxy...&#10;&#10;In Star Wars: The Deckbuilding Game, a head-to-head game for two players, the galaxy-spanning war between the Galactic Empire and the Rebel Alliance comes alive on your tabletop. In this easy-to-learn game, you and your opponent each choose a side, playing as either the Empire or the Rebels, and as the game progresses you both strengthen the power of your starting decks and work to destroy each other's bases. The first player to destroy three of their opponent's bases wins.&#10;&#10;In more detail, each player starts with a unique ten-card deck, with seven of those cards providing only resources to acquire new cards. Six cards from a galaxy deck are always on display, with Rebel cards facing the Rebel player, Empire cards the Empire player, and neutral cards turned sideways. You can spend resources to acquire cards in the galaxy row that don't belong to the opponent, and you can use attack power to take out cards that do belong to them, gaining a reward in the process.&#10;&#10;Each player starts with a base that lacks abilities (Dantooine for the Rebels and Lothal for the Empire), but when that base is destroyed, you get to choose a replacement from your base deck, with each base having a special ability. Choose wisely to counter your opponent's plans! In addition to having special abilities, capital ships absorb damage meant for your base.&#10;&#10;Players also fight for control of a Force track to gain additional resources or make use of &quot;If the Force is with you...&quot; abilities on their cards.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	2	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/U6scsOGrPtVym4nCLaYjyw__original/img/bPFq87JbA919A2vxks_PFF2DwsY=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic7387735.png	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/U6scsOGrPtVym4nCLaYjyw__thumb/img/0kgu-vLB9MQStlEyaR6bgKkemAQ=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7387735.png

Three factions &mdash; the Scottish, the Welsh, and the English &mdash; vie for control and, across the sea, foreign invaders prepare to take advantage of the chaos. Players must marshal their limited resources to influence this power struggle, while ensuring that the faction that rises to dominate the realm favors them above all other claimants to the throne.&#10;&#10;The King is Dead: Second Edition refreshes the accessible yet strikingly deep game with updated graphic design, gorgeous new artwork, and a brand-new asymmetric game mode for advanced play.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/p8ATnANurMdieJUELqN3IA__original/img/bnDn1undC8Pf6iAICKSv-4RaJXs=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5680120.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/p8ATnANurMdieJUELqN3IA__thumb/img/Cf-tr8Vc6XGuB-sN_rZq65OSVDw=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5680120.jpg
545	351913	Tiletum	In Tiletum, you and fellow players take on the roles of rich merchants traveling throughout Europe, from Flanders to Venice, during the Golden Age of the Renaissance.&#10;&#10;You will travel to various cities to acquire trade contracts for wool and iron, as well as a collection of their coats of arms. You must collect the required resources to fulfill contracts, invest in the construction of monumental cathedrals, gain the favor of noble families, and participate in important fairs where your main business occurs. You will also use the services of notable people who will be welcomed into your houses. You will thus gain prestige that will make you the most famous merchant of the Renaissance.&#10;&#10;Tiletum is a dice management game in which dice have a dual function: gaining resources and performing actions. A certain number of dice will be rolled each round. On your turn, choose a die to gain the number of corresponding resources equal to the value of the die, then perform the associated action. The power of the action is inversely proportional to the value of the die, so the fewer resources you gain, the more powerful the actions you take and vice versa.&#10;&#10;	\N	1	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/DvvSoTrB3-UMEgz2rBraHg__original/img/a70U9DGHGxiyo8WWMOb9Zd4hrxc=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic7533289.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/DvvSoTrB3-UMEgz2rBraHg__thumb/img/TnJONz9KNXPJBQ42sorXuoUTlew=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7533289.jpg
546	304420	Bonfire	The bonfires are sources of light, energy and warmth created by the guardians of light in order to brighten the cities on the otherwise dark planet. The residents of the cities however, took the bonfires for granted and exploited them for their personal gain. Disappointed the guardians of light retreated and let the bonfires extinguish. The citizens could no longer live in the now dark cities and were forced to leave.&#10;&#10;You are a group of gnomes living close to the cities and you also need and the light of the bonfires. Missing it now, you try yourself to visit the cities and learn how to ignite the bonfires once again: You must visit the guardians of light on their holy islands and ask for tasks to prove your good will. For each completed task, they will re-ignite one extinguished bonfire. Whoever manages to earn the greatest trust from the guardians and manages to brighten their city the most will win the game.&#10;&#10;The engine for Bonfire are the three-coloured tiles you will be puzzling onto your player board. When you manage to place the same colours adjacent to one another, you will receive more action tiles of that specific kind. This will allow you to specialize in certain types of actions and pursue different strategies. &#10;You can use the tiles to perform the following actions: &#10;- Move your ship to an island &#10;- Receive a task from an island by spending two resources &#10;- Invite a guardian of light into your city &#10;- Trigger a procession of guardians through your city and gain resources. &#10;- Add a landscape tile to your city (this is where the processions take place) &#10;- Recruit a gnome gaining a special ability or victory points &#10;- Find support by the last bonfire, gaining portals, resources or action tiles&#10;&#10;You will play in turn order until a fixed number of tasks has been solved, after which each player has 5 more turns. During final scoring, you will receive points for your completed tasks (the bonfires) and any improvements made there (portals, landscapes or guardians).&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from publisher&#10;&#10;	\N	1	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/q9sYvC0Tt-1mEiuKnVTS4w__original/img/6CZ5GNkB6vO0w6QGYe0kV_SvnP0=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5301335.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/q9sYvC0Tt-1mEiuKnVTS4w__thumb/img/Vi9tZ60juVkTpNoUIdLFzW8N9Aw=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5301335.jpg
547	25292	Merchants & Marauders	Merchants &amp; Marauders lets you live the life of an influential merchant or a dreaded pirate in the Caribbean during the Golden Age of Piracy. Seek your fortune through trade, rumor hunting, missions, and of course, plundering.  Modify your ship, buy impressive vessels, load deadly special ammunition, and hire specialist crew members. Will your captain gain eternal glory and immense wealth - or find his wet grave under the stormy surface of the Caribbean Sea?&#10;&#10;In Merchants and Marauders, players take on the role of a captain of a small vessel in the Caribbean.  The goal is to be the first to achieve 10 &quot;glory&quot; points through performing daring deeds (through the completion of missions or rumors), crushing your enemies (through defeating opponents and NPCs in combat), amassing gold, performing an epic plunder or pulling off the trade of a lifetime, and buying a grand ship.  While some points earned from performing various tasks are permanent, players earn points for amassing gold, which can be stolen or lost (or at least diminished) if their captain is killed.  Points due to gold are hidden so there's some uncertainty about when the game will end.&#10;&#10;A big component of the game is whether (or when) to turn &quot;pirate&quot; or remain as a trader or neutral party. Both careers are fraught with danger: pirates are hunted by NPCs (and other players) for their bounty and blocked to certain ports while traders are hunted by non-player pirates as well as their opponents and generally have to sacrifice combat capability for cargo capacity.  Although players can kill each other, there is no player elimination as players may draw a new captain (with a penalty) so it's possible to come back from defeat.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/RmKYojYHmV8X-ebtNgaz-g__original/img/wrLHO6mElyCGzog0aHzJ9KE-SeE=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic738119.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/RmKYojYHmV8X-ebtNgaz-g__thumb/img/Rd6POAEmJOEtwKB7bSDTKPsL_9k=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic738119.jpg
548	234277	Nusfjord	Nusfjord is a tranquil fishing village in the Lofoten archipelago in northern Norway. Fifty years ago, business was blooming when the codfish would come for spawning. Today, Nusfjord is more of a museum than a village, with less than a hundred people living there. Imagine how beautiful this place must be given that you must pay a fee to even look at the houses. Cruise ships used to pass by this long and now mostly abandoned island world.&#10;&#10;In the time period in which the game Nusfjord is set, things looked quite different. Sailing ships dominate the fjord. The rocks around Nusfjord are covered in trees. As the owner of a major fishing company in Nusfjord on the Lofoten archipelago, your goal is to develop the harbor and the surrounding landscape, and to succeed you must enlarge your fleet, clear the forest, erect new buildings, and satisfy the local elders. Others do this as well, of course, so the competition is steep.&#10;&#10;As with Agricola and Ora et Labora, Nusfjord has a worker placement mechanism, with each player starting with three workers that they place on a central board to trigger certain actions. Whether a player wants to clear a forest on their own board, buy a new cutter, or construct a building, they must place a worker on the appropriate space &mdash; which is possible only if room is available for this worker. Money is scarce, and one of the quicker and easier ways to get it is to place shares of your own company on the market. This risky action could be worthwhile because if you succeed in buying these shares yourself, you have usually won money and not suffered any disadvantages; however, if an opponent acquires these shares, then you must allow them to benefit from your hard-earned catches at sea. The village elders might want their own share of your catch as well, especially if you've visited them to take certain actions in the village, so if you don't take care, your catch could end up entirely in the hands of others and your camp will be empty.&#10;&#10;	\N	1	5	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/nKYqNPEE94Zk_q5Vtk527w__original/img/Bf35-bzWhSF8jMq8pfzubBxuNlU=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3729070.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/nKYqNPEE94Zk_q5Vtk527w__thumb/img/b380XF_C0n--whN9elUn8jI__Yg=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3729070.jpg
549	21241	Neuroshima Hex! 3.0	Neuroshima Hex! is a strategy game set in the post-apocalyptic world of Neuroshima, a Polish role-playing game. Each player leads one of four armies: Borgo, Hegemonia (Hegemony), Moloch, and Posterunek (Outpost). Each army deck consists of 34 tiles: soldiers, support tiles, and special actions. You win when all enemy headquarters are destroyed or when your headquarters is the least damaged at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;The second edition of Neuroshima Hex!, released at Spiel 2007, had updated graphics and a new, larger board; a special expansion pack sold at the same time included the Neuroshima Hex! Doomsday Machine 1.0, a fifth army that could be used against any of the other ones.&#10;&#10;The first French edition of Neuroshima Hex!, released in 2008, included an additional four Mercenary tiles. The first English edition from Z-Man Games that same year includes the Mercenary tiles and the Mad Bomber tile.&#10;&#10;Neuroshima Hex! 3.0, released in 2013 from Z-Man Games, includes rule corrections, the Doomsday Machine army (for five armies in the NH base game), a solo variant with 55 puzzle cards that present you with challenging situations, and new three-player variants: Deathmatch; Deathmatch with scores; one player vs. a team; and a team match (with one player playing two armies).&#10;&#10; The game is also expanded by Unofficial Neuroshima Hex! expansions, available here on BGG.&#10;&#10;Note:  All base game and expansion armies in all versions/editions are functionally compatible!  The only differences between armies from e.g. 3.0 and 2.5 (or whatever) are art &amp; graphic design.&#10;&#10;Note:  There is no solitaire bot/AI/system to compete against.  The only options for &quot;solo&quot; play are soloing multiple factions yourself, or solving puzzles (like Chess checkmate problems) available in some editions and expansions.&#10;&#10;	\N	1	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/8KB-cVXjNmYA6xuw-lo6eg__original/img/Qifs0EDB048uO_ROk7yx7d6wdbY=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1844819.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/8KB-cVXjNmYA6xuw-lo6eg__thumb/img/zjrFK62DgQIbaYI_BkJdd1X_xi8=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1844819.jpg
550	47	Chinatown	This is a negotiation game in the truest sense of the word. In it, players acquire ownership of sections of city blocks then place tiles, representing businesses, onto the block-sections.  At the end of each turn, each tile you've laid gives you some sort of payout, but completed businesses (formed of three to six connected tiles of the same type) pay quite a bit better.  All these resources are dealt to the players randomly, however, so players must trade to get matching businesses and adjacent locations.&#10;&#10;This game is #2 in the Alea big box series.&#10;&#10;	\N	3	5	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/QnIOe-1wb8_zuxglKjAwOQ__original/img/KVIx8Af2rXVkyaUA8lxjl_H1aWc=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic2037509.png	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/QnIOe-1wb8_zuxglKjAwOQ__thumb/img/CyDOXyRu7MHfn2ZS9pb9XmOStv0=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2037509.png

554	297030	Tekhenu: Obelisk of the Sun	Four millennia ago on the eastern bank of the Nile river was laid the foundation of the Temple of Amun-Ra. Over the course of two thousand years, the temple complex was gradually expanded and became widely known as &quot;The Most Select of Places&quot; (Ipet-Isut), boasting the largest religious building in the world. Today, the site is known as Karnak, located at Luxor in modern-day Egypt.&#10;&#10;Join ancient Pharaohs in creating and growing one of the most impressive sites the world has seen, honoring the Egyptian gods Horus, Ra, Hathor, Bastet, Thoth, and Osiris. You must carefully manage the balance of your actions, preparing for the reckoning by the goddess Maat.&#10;&#10;The game board in Tekhenu: Obelisk of the Sun is divided into six sections, each associated with an Egyptian god: Horus, Ra, Hathor, Bastet, Thoth, and Osiris. In the center stands an impressive obelisk (Tekhenu) that casts its shadow onto different parts of the board. As a result, the area around the obelisk is divided into sunny, shaded, and dark sections, depending on how the obelisk casts its shadow at that particular moment. As the game progresses, the sun's rotation alters which sections are sunny, shaded, or dark.&#10;&#10;The game takes place over multiple rounds. Each round, players draft dice and perform actions associated with the value of the die and the section from which the die was drafted. Dice come in five colors, and each die is considered Pure, Tainted, or Forbidden depending on the color of the die and the position of the obelisk's shadow. While you may never draft Forbidden dice, you are free to draft any other die, whether Pure or Tainted.&#10;&#10;As you draft the dice, you must consider not only the general availability of dice &mdash; if no dice are available in a given section, then you cannot readily perform the action associated with that section &mdash; but also which value die to draft. You must also consider the purity of the dice to draft, as you must balance your Pure and Tainted actions if you want to have a more favorable position in turn order.&#10;&#10;When you draft a die, you can perform an action depending on the section you took the die from. Each of the actions corresponds to a different Egyptian god: Horus, Ra, Hathor, Bastet, Thoth and Osiris. Instead of a god action, you can choose to produce, generating resources based on the color and value of the die, but beware of producing in excess of your production capacity, as this is Greed and adds Taint to your balance!&#10;&#10;Two scoring phases occur during the game, during which players earn victory points based on the workshops, quarries, buildings, statues and pillars they have built, as well as the happiness of their people and production capacity of their resources. However, players must also keep a healthy amount of resources around to sustain their population or they suffer negative consequences.&#10;&#10;	\N	1	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/CBLtzgG8zsqDkUZ_hN5-ew__original/img/jEL4WHl98vZHaZFcw9hDXxsxjSo=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5313583.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/CBLtzgG8zsqDkUZ_hN5-ew__thumb/img/QaUXxrgmXFrlNADgPeGhY5F538g=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5313583.jpg
555	150145	Skull King	Skull King is a trick-taking game similar to Oh Hell!, Wizard, Euchre and Spades, with players needing to state how many tricks they think they'll win each round. A unique element of this game is that bidding takes place simultaneously, leading to rounds that are sometimes over, or under-bid. As players must win the exact number of tricks that they bid to earn points, winning too many tricks is just as bad as winning too few and this leads to intense competition where losing a trick can be as exciting as winning one.&#10;&#10;Skull King uses a 66-card deck that consists of five Escape cards, four suits numbered 1-13, five Pirate cards, 1 Tigress card, and 1 Skull King card. The game lasts ten rounds, and in each round, each player is dealt as many cards as the number of the round. All players simultaneously bid on the number of tricks they think they'll take by holding out a fist and on the count of three revealing a certain number of fingers (or possibly a closed fist for a bid of zero tricks).&#10;&#10;Standard rules apply for the playing of cards, with one player leading off a card and other players following suit, if possible, and playing something else if not; however, a player may always choose to play one of the special, unnumbered cards &mdash; and the power of those cards might let you win a trick that otherwise would have gotten away. In more detail, the black Jolly Roger suit trumps the other three suits, a Mermaid trumps all numbered cards, a Pirate trumps the Mermaid, and the Skull King trumps everything &mdash; except if he appears in the same trick with a Mermaid, in which case she captures him and wins instead. An Escape card loses to any other card, and the Tigress card serves as either a pirate or escape card as desired by the player. Whoever wins a trick leads in the next trick.&#10;&#10;If a player makes their bid exactly, they score 20 points per trick; if they collect more or fewer tricks, they lose 10 points per trick they are off. If a player makes a bid of zero tricks, they win points equal to ten times the current round number &mdash; but if they take even a single trick, they lose this many points instead. If a player catches pirates with the Skull King, or the King with a mermaid, they score bonus points. Whoever has the most points after ten rounds wins.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	8	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/jiL3MIGH_w3g6El3OHVVig__original/img/JlMGgWGzFWmqz4s5DMLpPuHMUzg=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic6137456.png	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/jiL3MIGH_w3g6El3OHVVig__thumb/img/zvLGO1LcTpJABii1C8-CXDbjPSs=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6137456.png
556	219513	Bärenpark	Up to two thousand pounds in weight and over ten feet tall, the bear is considered the biggest and heaviest terrestrial carnivore in the world. Of course, there is not just &quot;one bear;&quot; on the contrary, there are plenty of subspecies that differ from each other in various aspects. For instance, only the Kodiak bear (ursus arctos middendorffi) weighs about 2,000 lbs. The polar bear (ursus maritimus) weighs &quot;only&quot; 1,100 lbs., but gets much bigger than the Kodiak bear, being as much as 11 ft. tall!&#10;&#10;B&auml;renpark takes you into the world of bears, challenging you to build your own bear park. Would you like another polar bear enclosure or rather a koala* house? The park visitors are sure to get hungry on their tour through the park, so build them places to eat! Whatever your choices are, make sure you get the next building permit and use your land wisely! (* No, koalas aren't bears but they're so cute, we couldn't leave them out of this game!)&#10;&#10;In more detail, each player in B&auml;renpark builds their own bear park, attempting to make it as beautiful as they can, while also using every square meter possible. The park is created by combining polyomino tiles onto a grid, with players scoring for animal houses, outdoor areas, completed construction, and more. The sooner you build it, the better! Cover icons to get new tiles and park sections. The game ends as soon as one player has finished expanding their park, then players tally their points to see who has won.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/9JC16l1EMwmJkpbjaUBkpw__original/img/H14LeRRtvcOajZ1Z1_pRYu_rSTM=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3486218.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/9JC16l1EMwmJkpbjaUBkpw__thumb/img/MbjH6nLmJQ5IjCgeULOjMfOf-NA=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3486218.jpg
557	176920	Mission: Red Planet (Second Edition)	With technology rapidly developing and the human population growing, Victorian-era Earth is in dire need of fuel, land, and other natural resources. Fortunately, automated probes sent to Mars have discovered celerium, an ore that can be combusted to produce ten thousand times more power than a steam engine, and sylvanite, the densest substance ever found. More incredibly, the probes found ice that could be used in terraforming the planet, bringing the idea of colonizing Mars even closer to becoming a reality.&#10;&#10;As the head of a mining corporation, these minerals and ice found on Mars could make you unfathomably wealthy &ndash; if you can reach them before your competitors. You have ten rounds to send your astronauts into space, occupy the planet's most resource-rich zones, and harvest as much celerium, sylvanite, and ice as possible. At your command is a team of nine professionals. Each has a unique skill set, from helping your astronauts traverse the Red Planet to blowing up spaceships before they launch.&#10;&#10;In each round in Mission: Red Planet, players start by secretly deploying one of their character cards, with this card determining both when they place astronauts on the spaceships awaiting launch to Mars and which special action they take during the round. Each spaceship has a specified destination, and until an astronaut sets foot in a region, no one knows which resource they'll find. Players collect resources (worth points) three times during the game, and they each have a secret mission card that might grant them additional points at game's end. During the game, players might acquire an additional mission or a research card that changes the value of what awaits on Mars.&#10;&#10;The 2015 edition of Mission: Red Planet features the same gameplay as the original 2005 edition, but it includes:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Components for up to six players instead of five&#10;    Special two-player variant rules&#10;    New action cards and revised mission and discovery cards&#10;    Mars' moon Phobos as a new zone that astronauts can explore before possibly returning to the planet itself&#10;&#10;&#10;	\N	2	6	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/qMUyGstRWieYOyTVA1vsNQ__original/img/5AvYhFjlCGzHxGrvmlj-Qg6_uW0=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2499748.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/qMUyGstRWieYOyTVA1vsNQ__thumb/img/DAoKCAePfujueMVYiwWmGDJPZgk=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2499748.jpg

559	59959	Letters from Whitechapel	Get ready to enter the poor and dreary Whitechapel district in London 1888 &ndash; the scene of the mysterious Jack the Ripper murders &ndash; with its crowded and smelly alleys, hawkers, shouting merchants, dirty children covered in rags who run through the crowd and beg for money, and prostitutes &ndash; called &quot;the wretched&quot; &ndash; on every street corner.&#10;&#10;The board game Letters from Whitechapel, which plays in 90-150 minutes, takes the players right there. One player plays Jack the Ripper, and his goal is to take five victims before being caught. The other players are police detectives who must cooperate to catch Jack the Ripper before the end of the game. The game board represents the Whitechapel area at the time of Jack the Ripper and is marked with 199 numbered circles linked together by dotted lines. During play, Jack the Ripper, the Policemen, and the Wretched are moved along the dotted lines that represent Whitechapel's streets. Jack the Ripper moves stealthily between numbered circles, while policemen move on their patrols between crossings, and the Wretched wander alone between the numbered circles.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	6	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/H3G1t-oIjN9gEVVI21FoVg__original/img/YfHGqQB_HXicZUTY-XgXgpsl_rg=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1545654.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/H3G1t-oIjN9gEVVI21FoVg__thumb/img/f6VZ_PEr1DAr6oLEjG9PxGFYzmQ=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1545654.jpg
560	39856	Dixit	Each turn in Dixit, one player is the storyteller, chooses one of the six cards in their hand, then makes up a sentence based on that card's image and says it out loud without showing the card to the other players. Each other player then selects the card in their hand that best matches the sentence and gives the selected card to the storyteller, without showing it to anyone else.&#10;&#10;The storyteller shuffles their card with all of the received cards, then reveals all of these cards. Each player other than the storyteller then secretly guesses which card belongs to the storyteller. If nobody or everybody guesses the correct card, the storyteller scores 0 points, and each other player scores 2 points. Otherwise, the storyteller and whoever found the correct answer score 3 points. Additionally, the non-storyteller players score 1 point for every vote received by their card.&#10;&#10;The game ends when the deck is empty or if a player has scored at least 30 points. In either case, the player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;The Dixit base game and each expansion contains 84 cards, and the cards can be mixed together as desired.&#10;&#10;	\N	3	8	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/J0PlHArkZDJ57H-brXW2Fw__original/img/jt3kFCHJ3HJ2079dMLwipFZqdQg=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic6738336.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/J0PlHArkZDJ57H-brXW2Fw__thumb/img/QVwPXskFikQwBQlrdLJBAiRGgdg=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6738336.jpg
561	318184	Imperium: Classics	Formidable adversaries are arrayed against you. Your people stand ready. History beckons.&#10;&#10;In your hands lies the destiny of one of history's great civilizations. Under constant threat of attack, you must conquer new lands, oversee dramatic scientific and cultural advances, and lead your people into the era of empire. Expand too rapidly, and unrest will bring your civilization to its knees; build up too slowly, however, and you might find yourself a mere footnote of history. As one of eight radically asymmetric civilizations, you will compete to become the most dominant empire the world has ever seen.&#10;&#10;Imperium: Classics is a standalone game that contains the Carthaginian, Celt, Greek, Macedonian, Persian, Roman, Scythian, and Viking civilizations and an individual solo opponent behaving as each nation. It is also fully compatible with Imperium: Legends for players wanting to expand their pool of civilizations even further.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;	\N	1	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/MN0OvKejfrfwD6bupQHp4g__original/img/AYYyjw10ExHhOFLYectIclqQnxI=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5623566.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/MN0OvKejfrfwD6bupQHp4g__thumb/img/MVh7xtQ4l17hprI4mFIk9Kswk6s=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5623566.jpg

564	181304	Mysterium	In the 1920s, Mr. MacDowell, a gifted astrologer, immediately detected a supernatural being upon entering his new house in Scotland. He gathered eminent mediums of his time for an extraordinary s&eacute;ance, and they have seven hours to make contact with the ghost and investigate any clues that it can provide to unlock an old mystery.&#10;&#10;Unable to talk, the amnesiac ghost communicates with the mediums through visions, which are represented in the game by illustrated cards. The mediums must decipher the images to help the ghost remember how he was murdered: Who did the crime? Where did it take place? Which weapon caused the death? The more the mediums cooperate and guess well, the easier it is to catch the right culprit.&#10;&#10;In Mysterium, a reworking of the game system present in Tajemnicze Domostwo, one player takes the role of ghost while everyone else represents a medium. To solve the crime, the ghost must first recall (with the aid of the mediums) all of the suspects present on the night of the murder. A number of suspect, location and murder weapon cards are placed on the table, and the ghost randomly assigns one of each of these in secret to a medium.&#10;&#10;Each hour (i.e., game turn), the ghost hands one or more vision cards face up to each medium, refilling their hand to seven each time they share vision cards. These vision cards present dreamlike images to the mediums, with each medium first needing to deduce which suspect corresponds to the vision cards received. Once the ghost has handed cards to the final medium, they start a two-minute sandtimer. Once a medium has placed their token on a suspect, they may also place clairvoyancy tokens on the guesses made by other mediums to show whether they agree or disagree with those guesses.&#10;&#10;After time runs out, the ghost reveals to each medium whether the guesses were correct or not. Mediums who guessed correctly move on to guess the location of the crime (and then the murder weapon), while those who didn't keep their vision cards and receive new ones next hour corresponding to the same suspect. Once a medium has correctly guessed the suspect, location and weapon, they move their token to the epilogue board and receive one clairvoyancy point for each hour remaining on the clock. They can still use their remaining clairvoyancy tokens to score additional points.&#10;&#10;If one or more mediums fail to identify their proper suspect, location and weapon before the end of the seventh hour, then the ghost has failed and dissipates, leaving the mystery unsolved. If, however, they have all succeeded, then the ghost has recovered enough of its memory to identify the culprit.&#10;&#10;Mediums then group their suspect, location and weapon cards on the table and place a number by each group. The ghost then selects one group, places the matching culprit number face down on the epilogue board, picks three vision cards &mdash; one for the suspect, one for the location, and one for the weapon &mdash; then shuffles these cards. Players who have achieved few clairvoyancy points flip over one vision card at random, then secretly vote on which suspect they think is guilty; players with more points then flip over a second vision card and vote; then those with the most points see the final card and vote.&#10;&#10;If a majority of the mediums have identified the proper suspect, with ties being broken by the vote of the most clairvoyant medium, then the killer has been identified and the ghost can now rest peacefully. If not, well, perhaps you can try again...&#10;&#10;	\N	2	7	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/wfeAiLK5n5hD1omhnlYLLA__original/img/uhvKoYDfAsLg-nMkjQcbSJTDFmU=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2601683.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/wfeAiLK5n5hD1omhnlYLLA__thumb/img/NAl-NrSAmWvklSVr3hKrSwiszNA=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2601683.jpg
565	70919	Takenoko	A long time ago at the Japanese Imperial court, the Chinese Emperor offered a giant panda bear as a symbol of peace to the Japanese Emperor. Since then, the Japanese Emperor has entrusted his court members (the players) with the difficult task of caring for the animal by tending to his bamboo garden.&#10;&#10;In Takenoko, the players will cultivate land plots, irrigate them, and grow one of the three species of bamboo (Green, Yellow, and Pink) with the help of the Imperial gardener to maintain this bamboo garden. They will have to bear with the immoderate hunger of this sacred animal for the juicy and tender bamboo. The player who manages his land plots best, growing the most bamboo while feeding the delicate appetite of the panda, will win the game.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/uvz-5V6A2R6dp2oWIXmj_g__original/img/HxMG1z7bIVGCGPI6u6ciVO0Oubk=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1912529.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/uvz-5V6A2R6dp2oWIXmj_g__thumb/img/vz9Ec1xB2b4JJQlZFijUsuCvfkQ=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1912529.jpg

567	163745	Star Wars: Armada	Massive Star Destroyers fly to battle against Rebel corvettes and frigates. Banks of turbolasers unleash torrential volleys of fire against squadrons of X-wing and TIEs. Engineering teams race to route additional power to failing shields. Laser blasts and explosions flare across the battlefield. Even a single ship can change the tide of battle.&#10;&#10;In Star Wars: Armada, you assume the role of fleet admiral, serving with either the Imperial Navy or Rebel Alliance. You assemble your fleet and engage the enemy. Using the game&rsquo;s unique maneuver tool, you steer your capital ships across the battlefield, even while squadrons of starfighters buzz around them. Then, as these ships exchange fire, it&rsquo;s your job to issue the tactical commands that will decide the course of battle and, perhaps, the fate of the galaxy.&#10;&#10;Maneuver Tool&#10;The maneuver tool is one of the game&rsquo;s most innovative features and adds a unique feel to the way your capital ships must accommodate for inertia as they maneuver through the stars.&#10;&#10;It consists of a number of segments linked with hinges, which is used to plot the ship's course. More nimble ships are allowed to turn the ship further at each hinge.&#10;&#10;Command Stack&#10;Armada balances the awesome scale of the Star Wars galaxy&rsquo;s ships and space warfare with intuitive ship designs and accessible rules for issuing commands and resolving combat that make for rich, engaging, and highly tactical play experiences.&#10;&#10;Capital ships are extremely powerful war machines, but they&rsquo;re also massive and sophisticated vessels that can&rsquo;t swiftly react to every development in the heat of battle. Accordingly, the key to flying these vessels effectively is learning how to plan ahead. You want to issue your commands in such a way that your crews will be ready to execute them at just the right times.&#10;&#10;Each of your pre-painted capital ships has a command value, which determines how many commands it will have in its stack at any given point in time. During setup, you secretly build your initial command stack, selecting from any of four different commands, each of which provides a different advantage. Once you have locked your selections, you place the commands in your stack in the order of your choice. Then, during each round of game play, you secretly select and assign a new command to your ship, placing it at the bottom of your command stack, before you reveal the command at the top of your stack and gain its benefits.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	2	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/oKBz9HmfYDsgDgpy06LPoQ__original/img/ufYeXlOSXa4yAJ8y-3NGmgT478w=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2355171.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/oKBz9HmfYDsgDgpy06LPoQ__thumb/img/Zf53Rbb6CFBizk_2iLyhYGEE8QQ=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2355171.jpg

Solo and Cooperative play are driven by a scenario book that chronicles the story of the game from the perspective of each individual faction. Players control one of four unique factions in a battle to destroy and steal source energy from their opponents. Send and defend against armies and minions, build towers to protect your base, and explore with your heroes in search of resources and powerful Relics to turn the tide of battle.&#10;&#10;Taking place in the floating realm of Ankar, Cloudspire tells the story of a war to acquire a powerful and rare energy known only as &quot;the source.&quot; Every race has their own unique units and heroes as well as the ability to bid and draft mercenaries for hire.&#10;&#10;Armies are placed either individually or in stacks to conceal powerful units until the last possible moments. Heroes, in the meantime, are controlled individually and may join the tide of battle or choose to explore points of interest in search of numerous resources. Meanwhile, the event deck regularly changes the terms of the fight, making every wave exciting and unpredictable.&#10;&#10;As armies and minions approach opposing bases, they'll need to contend with Spires - powerful defense towers that can be built around the board. Fight for control of build sites and acquire new spire schematics to build an impenetrable defense and hold off the enemy. Upgrade your home base to unlock new strategies and abilities. Level up your heroes and lead your armies into battle with advanced and upgraded skills!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;	\N	1	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/e9S5XKTJoAwmGnwDYLco4g__original/img/qYnw4PxRfObEY__KtwPv83Z2VEc=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic6683729.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/e9S5XKTJoAwmGnwDYLco4g__thumb/img/IFLcKIBoPNJCfEGERRaPIDOxnrg=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6683729.jpg
570	234	Hannibal: Rome vs. Carthage	This game uses the very popular card system which first appeared in Avalon Hill's We the People game to detail the struggle between Carthage's Hannibal and the Roman Republic in approximately 200 BC.&#10;&#10;Hannibal: Rome vs. Carthage is an asymmetrical card driven game for 2 players set in times of epic struggle between ancient Rome and Carthage. It presents a conflict between two super-powers of Antiquity from classical Clausewitzian perspective, according to which a power only reverts to military operations when there is no other way to achieve the goal: political dominance.&#10;&#10;Hannibal: Rome vs. Carthage has been designed by one of the most acclaimed designers in the World, Mark Simonitch. Players use Strategy Cards for multiple purposes: moving generals, levying new troops, reinforcing existing armies, gaining political control of the provinces involved in the war, and introducing historical events. When two armies meet on the battlefield, a second set of cards, called Battle Cards, are used to determine the winner. Ultimately both players seek victory by dominating both fronts: military and political.&#10;&#10;The 20th Anniversary of the release of this classic game will see the release of a new, revised, updated, and expanded game entitled Hannibal & Hamilcar. This new edition reimplements the Hannibal: Rome vs. Carthage game, and includes the Hamilcar: First Punic War expansion. See the Hannibal & Hamilcar entry for details of the 2017 revamped game.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	2	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/bqr3DAoxWUz1VeOCRk7gkw__original/img/h0puqZ7VhIY9Yi7WjVnRdnD4s8g=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic706069.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/bqr3DAoxWUz1VeOCRk7gkw__thumb/img/Zy5cZ_cx2foRN8z-BsqDQaN2l90=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic706069.jpg
571	37046	Ghost Stories	Ghost Stories is a cooperative game in which the players protect the village from incarnations of the lord of hell &ndash; Wu-Feng &ndash; and his legions of ghosts before they haunt a town and recover the ashes that will allow him to return to life. Each Player represents a Taoist monk working together with the others to fight off waves of ghosts.&#10;&#10;The players, using teamwork, will have to exorcise the ghosts that appear during the course of the game. At the beginning of his turn, a player brings a ghost into play and places it on a free spot, and more than one can come in at the same time. The ghosts all have abilities of their own &ndash; some affecting the Taoists and their powers, some causing the active player to roll the curse die for a random effect, and others haunting the villager tiles and blocking that tile's special action. On his turn, a Taoist can move on a tile in order to exorcise adjacent ghosts or to benefit from the villager living on the tile, providing it is not haunted. Each tile of the village allows the players to benefit from a different bonus. With the cemetery, for example, Taoists can bring a dead Taoist back to life, while the herbalist allows to recover spent Tao tokens, etc. It will also be possible to get traps or move ghosts or unhaunt other village tiles.&#10;&#10;To exorcise a ghost, the Taoist rolls three Tao dice with different colors: red, blue, green, yellow, black, and white. If the result of the roll matches the color(s) of the ghost or incarnation of Wu-Feng, the exorcism succeeds. The white result is a wild color that can be used as any color. For example, to exorcise a green ghost with 3 resistance, you need to roll three green, three white, or a combination of both. If your die rolls fall short, you can also use Tao tokens that match the color in addition to your roll. You may choose to use these after your roll. Taoists gain these tokens by using certain village tiles or by exorcising certain ghosts. One of the Taoists has a power that allows him to receive such a token once per turn.&#10;&#10;To win, the players must defeat the incarnation of Wu-Feng, a boss who arrives at the end of the game. There are also harder difficulty levels that add more incarnations of Wu-Feng, in which to win, you must defeat all of them.&#10;&#10;There are many more ways to lose, however. The players lose if three of the village's tiles are haunted, if the draw pile is emptied while the incarnation of Wu-Feng is still in play, or if all the priests are dead.&#10;&#10;	\N	1	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Mfoj66t524ZS5DKMZJlUYQ__original/img/u0Q_C6KB_2A0sjeX7iYESNW2_Z8=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1790243.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Mfoj66t524ZS5DKMZJlUYQ__thumb/img/gU9MeF5k_g-Go3GXqh3GPsucsRY=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1790243.jpg
572	301880	Raiders of Scythia	Many centuries ago, the Greek, Persian and Assyrian empires controlled vast amounts of land and riches. Yet, despite their fortifications and imposing armies, rumours began spreading of a formidable foe in the lands above the Black Sea. They came on horseback. Fierce warriors, both male and female. Skilled with the sword, axe and bow. But they weren&rsquo;t mindless savages. Their artisans were renowned for their ability to craft detailed trinkets of gold. They fashioned leather armour and improvised the recurve bow. They trained eagles for hunting and war. Some even believe they inspired the Greek tales of the Amazons. But they were more than legend or fable. They were the Raiders of Scythia.&#10;&#10;The aim of Raiders of Scythia is to be the player with the most Victory Points (VP) at the game&rsquo;s end. VP are gained by raiding Settlements, taking Plunder and completing Quests. Players will need to assemble a Crew, train Animals and gather Provisions. The game ends when there is only 2 unraided Settlements or 2 Quests remaining on the Main Board.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;	\N	1	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/07MRsX6Tv5elGdefTOQxsQ__original/img/rkl_5cLb9YtPkJDkzbVnflUNX3c=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic5235769.png	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/07MRsX6Tv5elGdefTOQxsQ__thumb/img/3iAtZSZA55jzXOgLP-nnRF3wAnc=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5235769.png
573	119890	Agricola: All Creatures Big and Small	Agricola: All Creatures Big and Small is a new take on Uwe Rosenberg's Agricola designed for exactly two players and focused only on the animal husbandry aspect of that game. So long plows and veggies!&#10;&#10;In Agricola: All Creatures Big and Small, you become an animal breeder of horses, cows, sheep and pigs and try to make the most of your pastures. Players start with a 3x2 game board that can be expanded during play to give more room for players to grow and animals to run free. Sixteen possible actions are available for players to take, with each player taking three actions total in each of the eight rounds.&#10;&#10;The player who amasses the most victory points through enclosing space with fences and acquiring the largest number and variety of animals and victory point-generating buildings will be the winner.&#10;&#10;Four Standard Buildings and 4 special buildings are available in the base game.  These buildings each provide unique special abilities during play and/or VP at game end.  Balancing the tension between building infrastructure (fenced pastures and buildings) and acquiring animals (the single biggest source of end-game scoring) is the key to success!&#10;&#10;	\N	2	2	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/iaxdcb_l3F8McwzyoiiCig__original/img/0jQpVjFEcjoIPpVGRf2DhO-jzLo=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1514252.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/iaxdcb_l3F8McwzyoiiCig__thumb/img/UWsWeuOQpGv5asAoyrKgwL3pVj0=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1514252.jpg
599	372	Schotten Totten	In Schotten Totten, nine boundary stones lie between you and your opponent.  In front of each, you build poker-like formations of three cards on a side.  Whoever plays the higher-ranking formation wins the stone.  And in a unique twist, you may use your powers of logic to claim a stone even before your opponent has played all three of his cards, by demonstrating that the stone is impossible for him to win.  Successfully claim five stones, or any three adjacent stones, and you win the game.&#10;&#10;In 2000 GMT published a rethemed version as Battle Line which includes an extra 10 &quot;tactics&quot; cards that modify the standard game play, and with cards that run from 1 to 10 (instead of 1 to 9).&#10;&#10;The 2004 Edition of Schottentotten has these &quot;tactics&quot; cards too.&#10;Schotten-Totten FAQ.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	2	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/69mwXe7c6HNYmT6S35Y4zg__original/img/C5YBiD7Qhpkf5FO1GteEjo9KRVE=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2932872.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/69mwXe7c6HNYmT6S35Y4zg__thumb/img/97DW-2XWDrSSkgy3XnUJ7f7tLiQ=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2932872.jpg
574	128271	Ginkgopolis	2212: Ginkgo Biloba, the oldest and strongest tree in the world, has become the symbol of a new method for building cities in symbiosis with nature. Humans have exhausted the resources that the Earth offered them, and humanity must now develop cities that maintain a delicate balance between resource production and consumption. Habitable space is scarce, however, and mankind must now face the challenge of building ever upwards. To develop this new type of city, you will gather a team of experts around you, and try to become the best urban planner for Ginkgopolis.&#10;&#10;In  Ginkgopolis, the city tiles come in three colors: yellow, which provides victory points; red, which provides resources; and blue, which provides new city tiles. Some tiles start in play, and they're surrounded by letter markers that show where new tiles can be placed.&#10;&#10;On a turn, each player chooses a card from his hand simultaneously. Players reveal these cards, adding new tiles to the border of the city in the appropriate location or placing tiles on top of existing tiles. Each card in your hand that you don't play is passed on to your left-hand neighbor, so keep in mind how your play might set up theirs!&#10;&#10;When you add a new tile to the city, you take a &quot;power&quot; card of the same color, and these cards provide you additional abilities during the game, allowing you to scale up your building and point-scoring efforts.&#10;&#10;	\N	1	5	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/2y2A4qcoGamLcYNLv8wb5A__original/img/tC1u-idEJeuZui-n806S9nw3oPI=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5975231.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/2y2A4qcoGamLcYNLv8wb5A__thumb/img/U27Rs0NzKCs5s6V5CeA-fw5e4Lc=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5975231.jpg
575	41114	The Resistance	The Empire must fall. Our mission must succeed. By destroying their key bases, we will shatter Imperial strength and liberate our people. Yet spies have infiltrated our ranks, ready for sabotage. We must unmask them. In five nights we reshape destiny or die trying. We are the Resistance!&#10;&#10;The Resistance is a party game of social deduction. It is designed for five to ten players, lasts about 30 minutes, and has no player elimination. The Resistance is inspired by Mafia/Werewolf, yet it is unique in its core mechanics, which increase the resources for informed decisions, intensify player interaction, and eliminate player elimination.&#10;&#10;Players are either Resistance Operatives or Imperial Spies. For three to five rounds, they must depend on each other to carry out missions against the Empire. At the same time, they must try to deduce the other players&rsquo; identities and gain their trust. Each round begins with discussion. When ready, the Leader entrusts sets of Plans to a certain number of players (possibly including himself/herself). Everyone votes on whether or not to approve the assignment. Once an assignment passes, the chosen players secretly decide to Support or Sabotage the mission. Based on the results, the mission succeeds (Resistance win) or fails (Empire win). When a team wins three missions, they have won the game.&#10;&#10;Rule Correction:&#10;&#10;For first printing (2010 purchases), the expansion rules should read: &quot;Games of 5-6 players use 7 plot cards, games with 7+ players use all 15 Plot Cards.&quot; and &quot;...each Round, the leader draws Plot cards (1 for 5-6 players, 2 for 7-8 players, and 3 for 9-10 players)&quot; - This has been corrected in the subsequent printings.&#10;&#10;	\N	5	10	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/cAPTkL2BR3snLO71dkH8rw__original/img/_UahoIUTqh39xRqzCc2jwgdYbSA=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2576459.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/cAPTkL2BR3snLO71dkH8rw__thumb/img/5lDn1W82rlLXtVG7nPIYR9Orn-4=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2576459.jpg
576	192458	51st State: Master Set	The world you know no longer exists. There is no government. No army. No civilization. The United States has collapsed, and now thirty years after the war started, new powers finally try to take control over the ruined country, try to establish a new order, try to control others and create a new country, a new state: the 51st State.&#10;&#10;51st State is a card game in which players control one of four powers trying to build a new country. Players put new locations into play, hire leaders, and send people to work in buildings to gain resources and new skills. To do this, every card in 51st State can be used in three different ways:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Raze a location to gain many resources once.&#10;    Deal with this location to gain one resource every turn.&#10;    Build the location so that you can use its skill each turn.&#10;&#10;&#10;51st State: Master Set marks the rebirth of the 51st State line, with this set containing 88 cards from the original base game, and 50 cards each from both the New Era and Winter expansions; one of these expansions can be mixed with the cards of the base game, but not both at the same time. The entire set has been rebalanced to offer a cohesive experience no matter which expansion you choose to use.&#10;&#10;	\N	1	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/oaDIooAl30NgVUWeIpC1sg__original/img/7jICcOLqm0LTdlXVUOUJloyqj2A=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2945432.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/oaDIooAl30NgVUWeIpC1sg__thumb/img/bWWziWTy6KflOseb2tYLNC0PrfQ=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2945432.jpg
577	234487	Altiplano	Altiplano is a bag-building game along the lines of Orl&eacute;ans, set in the South American highlands of the Andes (the &quot;Altiplano&quot;). The competition for limited resources is considerable, as it was in Orl&eacute;ans, but the greater focus in Altiplano is on building up your own production to be the best that it can be - or at least better than that of the other players!&#10;&#10;The object of the game is for players to use their goods to produce more goods that will be worth points in the end. Each player starts with a unique role tile, giving them access to different goods and methods of production. Players have limited access to production at the start, but they can acquire additional production sites during the game that open up new options. The various types of goods &mdash; such as fish, alpaca, cacao, silver and corn &mdash; all have their own characteristics and places where they can be used. For example, silver can be sold for a high price at the market, fish can be exchanged for other goods at the harbor and alpaca can produce wool at the farm that can then be made into cloth.&#10;&#10;Aside from building up an effective production, players must fulfill their orders at the right time, develop the road in good time and store their goods cleverly enough to fill their warehouses in the most valuable way. Often, a good warehouse keeper is more relevant in the end than the best producer.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	5	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/hgUDu_oG0uhnOWX4WM2vXA__original/img/S0BVejCX4yDWZv934q6BS7gAF9M=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4070329.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/hgUDu_oG0uhnOWX4WM2vXA__thumb/img/KlzN2TK2WVHgCimiLG_aoEZXVQA=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4070329.jpg

578	277085	Love Letter	The noble Princess is looking for an ideal partner and confidant to help with her royal duties when she one day assumes the throne. You must prove your worth and gain her trust by enlisting allies, friends, and family of the Princess to carry a letter of intent to her. Can you earn the Princess' trust and become her confidant?&#10;&#10;Playing cards one at a time, players in Love Letter use the abilities of these key people in the Princess' life to outwit their opponents and successfully deliver their letter and gain her favor. Players must utilize each character's special skill to avoid being caught and successfully deliver their letter to the Princess. Once a set number of favor tokens are acquired, that player wins and becomes the Princess' confidant.&#10;&#10;This 2019 edition of Love Letter features new artwork by Citadels artist Andrew Bosley, screen-printed tokens, and two new characters (five cards in total) that allow for games with up to six players. When played, the Chancellor (value 6) allows you to draw two new cards, add those to your hand, then place two cards of your choice on the bottom of the deck. The Spy (value 0) wins you a favor token if you were the only player to play or discard a spy during the round.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;	\N	2	6	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/V7WQjhAh0AatPXTYOrXtCQ__original/img/peOFPtAkzWUSpOSVTJu3pTDv2ck=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic4766499.png	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/V7WQjhAh0AatPXTYOrXtCQ__thumb/img/PNp3MFmie6ffR5RtyNs7TsVV4wA=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4766499.png
579	318084	Furnace	Furnace is an engine-building Eurogame in which players take on the roles of 19th-century capitalists building their industrial corporations and aspiring to make as much money as they can by purchasing companies, extracting resources, and processing them in the best combinations possible.&#10;&#10;Each player starts the game with a random start-up card, the resources depicted at the top of that card, and four colored discs valued 1-4.&#10;&#10;The game is played over four rounds, and each round consists of two phases: Auction and Production. During the auction, 6-8 company cards are laid out with their basic sides face up. Players take turns placing one of their discs on one of these cards, but you cannot place a disc on a card if a disc of the same value or color is already present. Thus, you'll place discs on four cards.&#10;&#10;Once all the discs are placed, the cards are resolved from left to right. Whoever placed the highest-valued disc will claim this card, but first anyone with a lower-valued disc on this card will gain compensation, either the resources depicted multiplied by the value of their disc or a processing ability (exchange X for Y) up to as many times as the value of their disc.&#10;&#10;Once all the cards have been claimed or discarded, players enter the production phase, using their cards in the order of their choice. Each company card has one action &mdash; either production or processing &mdash; on its basic side and two actions on its upgraded side. During the production phase, you can use each of your cards once to gain resources, process those resources into other resources or money, and upgrade your cards.&#10;&#10;At the end of four rounds, whoever has the most money wins.&#10;&#10;Furnace also includes capitalist cards that contain unique effects, and if you want, you can choose to deal one out to each player at the start of the game. For an additional challenge, you can require players to create a &quot;production chain&quot;, with each newly acquired company card being placed somewhere in that chain and locked in position for the remainder of the game.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/7UK6bLlP0Cz3EFYCqhtcSw__original/img/jc4av13AOJpkqfvcpJ39HyoeCoM=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic5934958.png	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/7UK6bLlP0Cz3EFYCqhtcSw__thumb/img/7WjwLTkySTiSMQu89ClZRhspd5Q=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5934958.png
580	8217	San Juan	San Juan is a card game based on Puerto Rico. The deck of 110 cards consists of production buildings (indigo, sugar, tobacco, coffee, and silver) and &quot;violet&quot; buildings that grant special powers or extra victory points. Cards from the hand can be either built or used as money to build something else; cards from the deck are used to represent goods produced by the production buildings, in which case they are left face-down. A seven-card hand limit is enforced once per round.&#10;&#10;In each round (or governorship), each player in turn selects from one of the available roles, triggering an event that usually affects all players, such as producing goods or constructing buildings. The person who picks the role gets a privilege, such as producing more goods or building more cheaply.&#10;&#10;Though similar in concept to Puerto Rico, the game has many different mechanisms. In particular, the game includes no colonists and no shipping of goods; goods production and trading are normally limited to one card per phase; and trades cannot be blocked. Victory points are gained exclusively by building, and the game ends as soon as one player has put up twelve buildings.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/kiD03bslLpN_0Qe1LJ8OGg__original/img/rFYh1En1BFLZ3n0Do-BwOnn7efU=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic174174.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/kiD03bslLpN_0Qe1LJ8OGg__thumb/img/VD6xhahkv4SR87FYOoQS9rKOpvo=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic174174.jpg
581	336986	Flamecraft	Artisan dragons, the smaller and magically talented versions of their larger (and destructive) cousins, are sought by shopkeepers so that they may delight customers with their flamecraft. You are a Flamekeeper, skilled in the art of conversing with dragons, placing them in their ideal home and using enchantments to entice them to produce wondrous things. Your reputation will grow as you aid the dragons and shopkeepers, and the Flamekeeper with the most reputation will be known as the Master of Flamecraft.&#10;&#10;In Flamecraft, 1-5 players take on the role of Flamekeepers, gathering items, placing dragons and casting enchantments to enhance the shops of the town. Dragons are specialized (bread, meat, iron, crystal, plant and potion) and the Flamekeepers know which shops are the best home for each. Visit a shop to gain items and a favor from one of the dragons there.  Gathered items can be used to enchant a shop, gaining reputation and the favors of all the dragons in the shop. If you are fortunate enough to attract fancy dragons then you will have opportunities to secure even more reputation.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from publisher&#10;&#10;	\N	1	5	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/EvGtnsBDcfnKiqSiXHothQ__original/img/7yj8nA0ObuZ1w5AYCThEOK6meWA=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic6605448.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/EvGtnsBDcfnKiqSiXHothQ__thumb/img/bQcyvzYRdMFFvcdQkFVnIRiCPjE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6605448.jpg
582	101721	Mage Wars Arena	What would it be like for Mages of vastly different schools and philosophies of magic to come together in an arena and fight to the death? How would an Illusionist battle a Druid? Or a Warlock fight a Beastmaster? Or a Priestess fare against a Wizard?&#10;&#10;Mage Wars &mdash; redubbed Mage Wars Arena in 2015 to distinguish it from Mage Wars Academy &mdash; pits powerful Mages against each other in deadly arena combat. Each Mage uses his own fully-customizable book of spells to achieve total victory over his opponent. Summon mighty creatures to do battle in your name; cast powerful spells to attack your foe and thwart his every plan and strategy; use hidden enchantments to turn the tables and rule the day; adorn yourself with mighty weapons, armor, and arcane artifacts &ndash; all of this and more await you in the arena of Mage Wars!&#10;&#10;Mage Wars is a tactical board game, a combination of a card game and miniatures game, combining the best elements from each genre. The game is played on an arena game board divided into square areas called &quot;zones&quot;, which regulate movement and the placement of objects. Each Mage (player) starts in a corner of the arena, opposite his enemy.&#10;&#10;Each player holds a spellbook, from which spell cards are pulled out as they are cast during the game. This has the feel of being a real Mage, turning the pages of your tome of magic, as you plan your strategy each turn. A point system allows you to choose spells for your spellbook, with more powerful spells and spells outside your schools of training costing more points. You have full access to cast any spell you want each turn, allowing for an unprecedented level of rich strategy and tactics. Many of these spells &ndash; such as creatures, equipment, and enchantments &ndash; are placed on the board and become objects in the game. Creatures can move around the arena, and attack each other and the enemy Mage. Attacks deal damage, as well as interesting special effects such as Burn, Corrode, Stun, Daze, Push, Cripple, Paralyze, etc. Creatures can be destroyed when they receive too much damage, or can be controlled by powerful curses and enchantments, or contained by walls and other creatures.&#10;&#10;Every Mage comes from a different school of magic, each with unique spells and strategies:&#10;&#10;&#10;    The Beastmaster will try to rush and swarm the enemy with his hordes of animals, buffed by his nature enchantments.&#10;    The Warlock will go right for the throat, armed with his powerful Lash of Hellfire, Helm of Fear, and Demonhide Armor. Along the way to the enemy Mage, he'll use his curses and fire attacks to contain and destroy enemy creatures.&#10;    The Wizard is a trickster, a master of meta-magic: countering, stealing, redirecting, and destroying enemy spells and mana. He's also a master of teleportation and portals/gates.&#10;    The Priestess will defend with knights and angels and powerful healing and protection spells. She'll wear down the enemy, then overwhelm them in the end.&#10;&#10;&#10;The base game comes with all you need to get started: spellbooks, extra spells to customize with the spellbooks, arena game board, dice, markers, etc.&#10;&#10;New Mages will be released every few months to add new spells, powers, and variety to the game. The game is NOT collectible, but is fully customizable!&#10;&#10;Extra copies of spells available with:&#10;&#10;    Mage Wars: Core Spell Tome 1&#10;    Mage Wars: Core Spell Tome 2&#10;&#10;&#10;	\N	2	2	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/QzZnTACp3MgfY1mqujWwzg__original/img/bewDIciem8n6TByYFZFaYg94_oQ=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic7271666.png	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/QzZnTACp3MgfY1mqujWwzg__thumb/img/ifaxBXGMPzZLYkh9jnayRzLhMCg=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7271666.png
675	62222	Commands & Colors: Napoleonics	Commands &amp; Colors: Napoleonics allows you to re-fight epic battles of the Napoleonic era. In this core volume, the focus is on the French and the British, two bitter rivals in the struggle for European preeminence during the time of Napoleon.&#10;&#10;As with other games in the Commands &amp; Colors genre, units in both armies can only move and fight when ordered. The command playing cards supply those orders, providing an element of luck that creates a fog of war and presents players with both challenges and opportunities. You must maximize your opportunities by playing your command cards judiciously. How well you handle the diverse units, their weapons, and the terrain, will determine victory.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	2	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/eVEF5fs8D22b0Bwj17mNgQ__original/img/C8DqUA3sh-p_RR9XL4RweCarLRM=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic837162.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/eVEF5fs8D22b0Bwj17mNgQ__thumb/img/qzxYJuD92hSlqarpDSdC5j_qo5I=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic837162.jpg

Magazine's Manager of the Year!&#10;&#10;Once a manager has chosen one of the six teams, he has five weeks to groom them into the best in the league, culminating with the Blood Bowl tournament. He does this by competing at highlights, collecting payouts, upgrading his personnel, and drafting Star Players.&#10;&#10;Managers begin the season with a starting team deck full of basic scrub players. These players are none too bright and have limited talents, but a clever manager can play to their strengths by carefully positioning them to excel on the pitch.&#10;&#10;Is your team ready to compete against other teams in head-to-head highlights? Highlights are the randomly determined matchups over which players compete. The more highlights a team wins, the more it improves and the more fans it accumulates.&#10;&#10;The season culminates with the Blood Bowl tournament. After the Blood Bowl, the season ends.

584	244711	Newton	The middle of the 17th century was a period of great changes; with the advent of the scientific method came what we now call the Scientific Revolution. Many great scientists, with their theories and ideas, changed and shaped our perception of the universe: Galileo Galilei, Copernicus, Kepler, Bacon and, above all, Sir Isaac Newton.&#10;&#10;In Newton, the players take the role of a young scientist who wants to become one of the great geniuses of this era. To reach their ultimate goal, they travel around Europe, visit universities and cities, study to discover new theories, build new tools and work to earn money.&#10;&#10;The game is played over six rounds. Each round, every player plays five cards from their hand, and each played card allows the player to perform one of the many actions of the game. An action can have a variety of effects, which depend on the symbols on the board. At the end of the round, a player can take back all the cards except for one. One card has to remain on the board, which means that you give up one possibility of doing that action, but also that that very action will be carried out with greater strength. Fortunately, you can acquire new cards with additional powers to perform more actions.&#10;&#10;After six rounds, you calculate your final score, and the player with the most VP wins.&#10;&#10;&#10;The New Edition includes:&#10;- Newton: Great Discoveries Expansion&#10;- Newton: Robert Hooke Promo Card&#10;- Newton: Stephen Hawking Promo Card&#10;Any other promos are not included.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;UPC 889696009043&#10;&#10;	\N	1	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ZyCjYnNS6VFF1X7e6IFA1A__original/img/4CK6Cx5xj0b0p6r69c7kvDjANGE=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4058665.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ZyCjYnNS6VFF1X7e6IFA1A__thumb/img/GW009LiSNJwiMx7Thb8TT9nSfDk=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4058665.jpg

586	25554	Notre Dame	Rio Grande Games' description:&#10;&#10;The players take on the roles of the heads of influential families in Paris at the end of the 14th century. In the shadow of the Notre Dame cathedral, the players compete for prosperity and reputation. Each family controls one of the 3&ndash;5 boroughs that surround the site of Notre Dame. As head of his family, each player tries, through clever use of his action cards, to advance the power and prestige of his family, but penalties are assessed on those who do not take care of the health of the people who live in their borough. The player with the most prestige at the end is the winner.&#10;&#10;&#10;Players play as well-off Parisians in the 14th century who wish to improve the importance and appearance of the city quarter around the famous Notre Dame cathedral. The primary game concept is original, but simple, card play players use to permanently improve their influence in the quarter. However, turn after turn, round after round, players must make choices that can have major implications. If one does one thing, then the other can't be done. Concentrating on one aspect means automatically ignoring another, which, above all others, is particularly dangerous in the case of the gradually approaching plague...&#10;&#10;After 9 exciting rounds and about 75 action-filled minutes, Notre Dame is over. The maitre who has made the most of his cards and has garnered the most prestige points is the winner.&#10;&#10;Description from Alea.&#10;&#10;This game is #11 in the Alea big box series.&#10;&#10;Expanded by:&#10;&#10;     6-/7-player expansion (unofficial)&#10;     Treasure Chest&#10;&#10;&#10;Reimplemented by:&#10;&#10;     Notre Dame Express (unofficial)&#10;&#10;&#10;	\N	2	5	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/d1g8Yh14XHf63H3VOC93AA__original/img/au2Y5st7foP0ohkFEbFqAOPR7Nc=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic199316.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/d1g8Yh14XHf63H3VOC93AA__thumb/img/DwCJeQSpNHs_cX8FfWwNlKqDRSQ=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic199316.jpg
587	155987	Abyss	The Abyss power is once again vacant, so the time has come to get your hands on the throne and its privileges. Use all of your cunning to win or buy votes in the Council. Recruit the most influential Lords and abuse their powers to take control of the most strategic territories. Finally, impose yourself as the only one able to rule the Abyssal people!&#10;&#10;Abyss is a game of development, combination and collection in which players try to take control of strategic locations in an underwater city. To achieve this, players must develop on three levels: first by collecting allies, then using them to recruit Lords of the Abyss, who will then grant access to different parts of the city. Players acquire cards through a draft of sorts, and the Lords of the Abyss acquired on those cards grant special powers to the cardholder &mdash; but once you use the cards to acquire a location, that power is shut off, so players need to time their land grabs well in order to put themselves in the best position for when the game ends.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/O9nPs9wrCghDF4izqFtoGQ__original/img/rStAIe-Q4IjeOhxlkg1SAinMbcY=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1965255.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/O9nPs9wrCghDF4izqFtoGQ__thumb/img/v2bPSjIYCfD7ekFGQswrRLwkonY=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1965255.jpg
676	322708	Descent: Legends of the Dark	Terrinoth is in peril. The demon-tainted Uthuk Y'llan barbarians stalk the realm and the undead servants of Waiqar the Undying venture beyond their borders for the first time in memory. The leaders of Terrinoth are divided and fractious, unable to unite against these common threats. And in the northern barony of Forthyn, the stage is set for the next great confrontation between Terrinoth and the forces of darkness...&#10;&#10;For years, your journeys have taken you across the fantasy realm of Terrinoth, venturing into dark forests, shadowy cities, ancient crypts, and misty swamps &mdash; but your true legend is about to begin.&#10;&#10;Forge your own legend together with friends as you adventure across the vibrant fantasy realm of Terrinoth in the co-operative dungeon-crawling board game Descent: Legends of the Dark. Powered by an integrated free companion app, Descent: Legends of the Dark puts you in the role of a budding hero with their own playstyle and abilities. Together with your unlikely companions, you'll begin an unexpected adventure &mdash; an adventure told across the sixteen quests of the &quot;Blood and Flame&quot; campaign. Throughout your campaign, you'll face undead lurking in the mists, demonic barbarians stalking the wilds, and even more terrifying threats. With 46 pieces of 3D terrain and forty hero and monster miniatures to draw you into the game, your greatest adventure is yet before you! Your objectives will change from quest to quest as you follow the overarching story of the campaign.&#10;&#10;Core gameplay mechanisms such as combat, fatigue, skills, items, and more have received completely new interpretations with Legends of the Dark, while a new approach to scenario layout and 3D terrain creates striking multi-level scenarios.&#10;&#10;Gameplay is fast and intuitive. You take three actions each turn: one maneuver action and two additional actions of your choice. Maneuvering gives you movement points, as shown in the upper right corner of the character sheet, and since you always have a maneuver action, you can reposition to put yourself in a more advantageous position for attack. Other than maneuvering, you can use an action to attack an enemy, rolling your attack dice and drawing upon your hero's abilities and weapons to deal maximum damage or inflict harmful conditions on your foes, or you may use the explore action to interact with a piece of 3D terrain or a token by using the app. You can also use your action to perform one of the most crucial actions in Legends of the Dark: the ready action, which lets you flip your hero sheet or one of your cards to its opposite side, unlocking new abilities!&#10;&#10;Your hero sheet isn't the only thing you can ready. Every hero also has an attack card and skill cards! Each hero starts the game with two weapon cards, which are sleeved together back-to-back to create a single attack card.  Skill cards can also be readied, switching between two complementary abilities.&#10;&#10;The app also brings new changes to gameplay, introducing enemies with adaptable strategies, complex status effects, and triggers fully managed by the app, and the ability to develop your heroes based on the choices you make in scenarios. You'll also uncover a wealth of activity between scenarios, such as crafting, shopping in the city, upgrading equipment, and more. Because of these various differences, Descent: Legends of the Dark is not compatible with Descent: Journeys in the Dark and its expansions.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;	\N	1	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Q96PxRVbrDxS9_4ZPTJtHQ__original/img/kGU8ligha3fyP0LuVTwmLMK9yEQ=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic5941333.png	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Q96PxRVbrDxS9_4ZPTJtHQ__thumb/img/hXnjkvD7KiLk2fon8tbvsXNtT_k=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5941333.png
588	24480	The Pillars of the Earth	Die S&auml;ulen der Erde / The Pillars of the Earth is based on the bestselling novel by Ken Follett and the 2006 game in the Kosmos line of literature-based games.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of the 13th century, construction of the greatest and most beautiful cathedral in England begins. Players are builders who try to contribute the most to this cathedral's construction and, in so doing, score the most victory points.  Gameplay roughly consists of using workers to produce raw materials, and then using craftsmen to convert the materials into victory points.  Workers may also be used to produce gold, the currency of the game.  Players are also given three master builders each turn, each of which can do a variety of tasks, including recruiting more workers, buying or selling goods, or just obtaining victory points.  Getting early choices with a master builder costs gold, as does purchasing better craftsmen.  Players must strike a balance between earning gold to fund their purchases and earning victory points.&#10;&#10;Expanded by:&#10;&#10;&#10;     The Pillars of the Earth Expansion Set (which include the Expansion Cards in some editions)&#10;     The Pillars of the Earth: Expansion Cards (which are included in the Expansion Set in some editions)&#10;&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/J897fuu-nl83_o90uOakVQ__original/img/mxQ3uSzeLoPcvD40_I1bEmgIjzU=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3691155.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/J897fuu-nl83_o90uOakVQ__thumb/img/s18kO6_0qCpGwK6IQZ9UhyJFjL8=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3691155.jpg
589	250458	Gùgōng	China, 1570. China is under the reign of the Longqing Emperor, of the Ming Dynasty. He inherited a country in disarray after years of mismanagement and corruption. He resided in the Forbidden city, which was the seat of many emperors under the Ming Dynasty. Constructed from 1406 to 1420, the complex consists of 980 buildings and covers 72 ha (over 180 acres). It is also under the Ming Dynasty that the Great Wall of China was rebuilt, fortified, and expanded. Around this period, China was under heavy attack from the Mongols, so maintaining the Great Wall was essential. Most of what we now have left of the Great Wall, we owe to the Ming dynasty.&#10;&#10;The country was already famous for its very intricate bureaucracy, but this also led to a lot of corruption. Even though the penalties for corruption were very high, the highest Officials of the Forbidden City would pretend to uphold the ban on corruption, by accepting gifts of petitioners, and returning one of seemingly lower value.&#10;&#10;G&ugrave;g&#197;&#141;ng uses this extraordinary custom as its basis. Players take on the role of powerful Chinese families trying to gain influence and power by exchanging gifts with Officials. The gift cards you offer as a player have to be of a higher value than the one you receive, forcing you to make strategic choices regarding which actions you want to take each turn. You will travel around China, sail down the Grand Canal, purchase precious jade, help construct the Great Wall, secure advantages through decrees, influence the game through intrigue, and ultimately, receive an audience with the emperor. If only 1 player succeeds in doing so, he wins. If several players succeed, the player with the most VPs among those players wins the game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;	\N	1	5	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/HJ263_vhLJ58QUWPvMVbEg__original/img/pUen2yvuqACs8rQ_aEt4SKViEfU=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4143114.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/HJ263_vhLJ58QUWPvMVbEg__thumb/img/uRX0KCJmdwWZiL8Z7fo4V-mwm_E=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4143114.jpg

You can use the abilities of some helpers to increase your income or production.&#10;&#10;Fields, customers, helpers, and miscellaneous objects are represented by cards. Each player receives two of these cards per round distributed by a bidding/drawing mechanism in which you end up with one of the cards you draw and one of the cards of a public offer filled by all players. Additionally, to these cards you always receive one field for free each round.&#10;&#10;Placing one good on a field fills the complete field with goods of this type. Each round, one unit per field is harvested. After planting, harvesting, and distributing cards, each player can use as many actions as he wants, only limited by the number of his cards or the number of goods he owns. At the end of his turn, he can invest the earned money on a scoring track, where early money is worth more than late money.

592	260428	Pandemic: Fall of Rome	At the height of its power, the Roman Empire held more than two million square miles of territory containing over a hundred million people. Throughout the centuries of its existence, the Empire brought major advancements in engineering, architecture, science, art, and literature. By the beginning of the 5th Century, decades of political corruption, economic crisis, and an overburdened military had exacted a severe toll on the stability of the Empire. This paved the way for severe incursions from aggressive barbarian tribes, leading to a decline from which Rome would not recover. Now citizens, soldiers, and allies of Rome must unite to protect the Empire.&#10;&#10;Combining the cooperative gameplay of Pandemic with innovative new mechanisms, Pandemic: Fall of Rome takes players back in history to the time of the world's greatest empire: Rome. A weakened military has left the borders open to invasion from countless tribes such as the Anglo-Saxons, Goths, Vandals, and Huns. As you march through the Roman Empire, you must recruit armies, fortify cities, forge alliances, and face off against the invading hordes in battle.&#10;&#10;Simply defending Rome is not enough; players must find a way to stop the incursions and find peace with their neighboring peoples. Players collect sets of matching-colored cards to forge an alliance with the different tribes. In doing so, they gain the ability to use cards matching the tribe to convert other members of that tribe into Roman soldiers, furthering their ability to hold the line against other invaders.&#10;&#10;Take on unique roles with special abilities to improve your team's chances to protect against the invaders. Work together, use your skills wisely, and stop the fall of Rome!&#10;&#10;Pandemic: Fall of Rome includes a solitaire mode in which the player takes on the burden of being the Emperor and commands three different roles to try to protect the city from the invading hordes. Players who want a more difficult game can try the &quot;Roma Caput Mundi&quot; challenge by adding more Revolt cards to the deck; they must also respect the law in Rome that Roman legions are not allowed in the city.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;	\N	1	5	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/B1VZL2s3EFifndAsI3k5KA__original/img/aq5YttqyUNm7Yx7QoU5nudFgx7k=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4328856.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/B1VZL2s3EFifndAsI3k5KA__thumb/img/6YugPtuKm8uCyJVrNOYl6u_qiPU=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4328856.jpg
593	40354	Maria	Maria is a game based on the War of the Austrian Succession, between 1740 and 1748, where Austria was attacked by Prussia, France, Bavaria and Saxony, while only Great Britain, Hanover and the Netherlands (by forming the so-called Pragmatic Army) helped her.&#10;&#10;Maria is primarily a 3 player game. One player is Austria, the second is France plus Bavaria, while the third player plays as Prussia (Austria's enemy) and the Pragmatic Army (Austria's ally) at the same time. This is made possible by the division of the map into two parts, the Flanders map and the Bohemia map.&#10;&#10;Maria is derived from the award-winning Friedrich, but has its very own character, including politics, hussars, force marches, imperial election, Saxony's betrayal and Prussia's annexation of Silesia. Subtle maneuvers, seizure of fortresses, prudent retreats, and Machiavellian politics are the keys to victory. However, players must be careful: whoever uses his Tactical Cards unwisely in battle can suddenly find himself not on the highway to glory but on the road to ruin.&#10;&#10;Maria takes you to the era of the 18th century's ruthless struggle for power. It can be played in 2 variants: the shorter, simplified introductory game or the longer but richer advanced game, with its simultaneous campaigns in Bohemia and Flanders.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	3	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/RKnoGhSQwVQo0Z_pXTE19g__original/img/taWfpVHP0yyEzNXQiIGkPwLCuLM=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic524669.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/RKnoGhSQwVQo0Z_pXTE19g__thumb/img/n-5E6_QWWDbxynAo4gqUvgMk2RE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic524669.jpg

595	202426	Sidereal Confluence	Sidereal Confluence: Trading and Negotiation in the Elysian Quadrant is a singularly unique trading and negotiation game for 4-9 players. Over the course of the game, each race must trade and negotiate with the rest to acquire the resource cubes necessary to fund their economy and allow it to produce goods for the next turn. Scheming, dealing, and mutually beneficial agreements are key to success. While technically a competitive game, Sidereal Confluence has a cooperative feel during the trading phase as no race has the ability to thrive on its own. Trade well, and you'll develop technologies and colonize planets to form a civilization that is the envy of the galaxy.&#10;&#10;Each player chooses one of the nine unique and asymmetrical alien races that have come together to form a trade federation in their quadrant. Each race has its own deck of cards representing all the existing and future technologies it might research. Some races also have other cards related to unique features of their culture. These cards represent portions of the culture's economy and require spending some number of cubes to use, resulting in an output of more cubes, ships, and possibly victory points. Since each culture's outputs rarely match their inputs, players need to trade goods with one another to run their converters to create the resources they truly need to run their society most efficiently and have an effective economy. Almost everything is negotiable, including colonies, ships, and all kinds of resources.&#10;&#10;Each game round contains an open trading phase in which all players can negotiate and execute deals for cubes, ships, colonies, even the temporary use of technologies! Players with enough resources can also research technologies, upgrade colonies, and spend resources on their race's special cards during this phase. Once complete, all players simultaneously run their economies, spending resources to gain more resources. The Confluence follows, starting with players sharing newly researched technologies with all other races and following with bidding to acquire new colonies and research teams. Researching a new technology grants many victory points for the prestige of helping galactic society advance. When one race builds a new technology, it is shared with everyone else. Technologies can be upgraded when combined with other technologies.&#10;&#10;The ultimate goal is victory points, which are acquired by researching technologies, using your economy to convert resources to goods, and converting your leftover goods into points at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;The game is almost all simultaneous play.&#10;&#10;Sidereal Confluence: Remastered Edition features the same gameplay as the first edition of the game from 2017, but features an updated card layout, a teaching guide, and an improved rulebook for easy set-up and learning with more visual examples and clear key terms.&#10;&#10;	\N	4	9	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/3V1Nmee3P4qSpVmWO9uGgw__original/img/1D98HsjtX5IzcwUMvd-67z1xzKo=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4981297.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/3V1Nmee3P4qSpVmWO9uGgw__thumb/img/ptUAPVk_LoqX7qDUt7ngtDXe-Qw=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4981297.jpg

597	195539	The Godfather: Corleone's Empire	Designer Eric Lang, known for his &quot;dudes on a map&quot; games, describes The Godfather: Corleone's Empire &mdash; a standalone big box board game with high-quality miniatures &mdash; as &quot;thugs on a map&quot;.&#10;&#10;In short, the game is a streamlined, confrontational worker placement game filled with murder and intrigue. You play as competing mafia families who are vying for economic control of the organized crime networks of New York City, deploying your thugs, your don, your wife, and your heir on the board to shake down businesses and engage in area-control turf wars.&#10;&#10;Money, rackets, contracts, and special advantages (such as the union boss) are represented by cards in your hand, and your hand size is limited, with you choosing which extra cards to pay tribute to the don at the end of each of the five rounds. At the end of the game, though, cash is all that matters, and whoever has the most money wins.&#10;&#10;The game also features drive-by shootings in which enemy tokens are removed from the board and placed face-down in the river.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	5	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/umGE4fOLYylHloIvw5bitA__original/img/aeV8Wk1EtLvu4n-ZXAlOAJGmeJk=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3364797.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/umGE4fOLYylHloIvw5bitA__thumb/img/Tr9FzWg8Iv76KjnTlZirhAdAfbI=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3364797.jpg
598	9217	Saint Petersburg	On May 16th, 1703, Czar Peter laid the cornerstone for the first building in Saint Petersburg. Quickly, glorious buildings were added, always being expanded, so that Nobility (bringing victory points) may want to move in. But to accomplish this, one needs merchants who can provide the necessary Rubles, or the glory is over. The competition isn't sleeping either, and can sometimes steal a desired card right out from under your nose.&#10;&#10;Saint Petersburg has a board to tally victory points and to set out the four types of cards.  It is the cards themselves that players need to collect.  In each round &ndash; with the number of rounds dependent on the number of players and the randomness of card availability &ndash; players first pay for CRAFTSMEN who supply money for further purchases; then BUILDINGS to score points; then ARISTOCRATS, who are needed for money, points, and end-of-game scoring; and finally, unique cards from all three categories which give greater benefits. During the first rounds, players never have enough money to buy every card they want. During later rounds, they have plenty of money, but the cards they'd like to buy may have already come and gone...&#10;&#10;Expanded by:&#10;&#10;    Sankt Petersburg: Das Bankett&#10;    Saint Petersburg: New Society & Banquet Expansion (includes The Banquet)&#10;&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Yoidfpvt2eACASYUpbmsyg__original/img/UMVconG3O34fGHYeL7HqTiT3igI=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic246360.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Yoidfpvt2eACASYUpbmsyg__thumb/img/oN0BjMknoiCwD-o5qeSCOxVPKF0=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic246360.jpg
600	215311	Downforce	High-stakes bidding on million-dollar race cars. Frantic bets placed in secret even as the cars race around the track. And to the victor, the biggest purse of all. But in the world of motor racing, the margin between victory and defeat can be a single moment: a steep banked turn, tires screaming and spitting out smoke, and the downforce, pressing you down in your seat and keeping you on the track as you make your move inside to pull ahead.&#10;&#10;Downforce is a card-driven bidding, racing, and betting game for 2-6 players based on Top Race, the award-winning design by the legendary Wolfgang Kramer. Players first bid to own the six cars in the race, then they play cards from their hand to speed them around the track. However, most cards will also move their opponents' cars. So figuring out just the right time to play a card is the key to victory. Along the way, players make secret bets on who they think will win the race. Whoever has the most money from their prize money, winning bets, and remaining bank wins.&#10;&#10;This is a game whose design needed no attention. Years of play and multiple versions have honed it to near perfection. On the contrary, one of the design challenges was figuring which of the many rules modules to incorporate to create the most fun version. Downforce also adds variable player powers to improve replayability. But mostly, it improves the look of the game to make it gorgeous and easy to play. Special attention was paid to the colors, the layout of the cards, the design of the cars, the details on the board, and more.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	6	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/c74C-NVJHuMVxt6A_j2TsA__original/img/FHgW4u5dIooEJnNjm2RXcO_yJWs=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic3432548.png	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/c74C-NVJHuMVxt6A_j2TsA__thumb/img/OUdT3uFyqBBzN7q9ZDFN6WBiecU=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3432548.png
601	1	Die Macher	Die Macher is a game about seven sequential political races in different regions of Germany. Players are in charge of national political parties, and must manage limited resources to help their party to victory. The winning party will have the most victory points after all the regional elections. There are four different ways of scoring victory points. First, each regional election can supply one to eighty victory points, depending on the size of the region and how well your party does in it. Second, if a party wins a regional election and has some media influence in the region, then the party will receive some media-control victory points. Third, each party has a national party membership which will grow as the game progresses and this will supply a fair number of victory points. Lastly, parties score some victory points if their party platform matches the national opinions at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;The 1986 edition featured four parties from the old West Germany and supported 3-4 players. The 1997 edition supports up to five players in the re-united Germany and updated several features of the rules as well.  The 2006 edition also supports up to five players and adds a shorter five-round variant and additional rules updates by the original designer.&#10;&#10;	\N	3	5	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/rpwCZAjYLD940NWwP3SRoA__original/img/yR0aoBVKNrAmmCuBeSzQnMflLYg=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4718279.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/rpwCZAjYLD940NWwP3SRoA__thumb/img/YT6svCVsWqLrDitcMEtyazVktbQ=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4718279.jpg
602	182134	Evolution: Climate	Evolution: Climate is a standalone game that introduces climate into the Evolution game system.&#10;&#10;In Evolution: Climate, players adapt their species in a dynamic ecosystem where food is scarce, predators lurk, and the climate can swing between scorching hot and icy cold. Traits like a Hard Shell and Horns can protect your species from Carnivores while a Long Neck will help them get food that others cannot reach.  Heavy Fur and Migratory can protect your species from the cold while being Nocturnal or Burrowing will provide protection from the cruel desert sun. With over 200,000 ways to evolve your species, every game evolves into a different adventure.&#10;&#10;The Climate standalone game dramatically changes game play with several simple additions to the Evolution base set:&#10;&#10;     Players draw 4 cards +1 per species per round (instead of 3 cards + 1 per species).&#10;     Each species may have up to 4 traits (instead of 3).&#10;     The climate moves along a Climate Track based upon the food cards played each round.&#10;     There are additional trait cards that provide protection from the heat and cold.&#10;&#10;&#10;Evolution: Climate changes Evolution from a two-dimensional game (dealing with the threat of Starvation and Carnivores) into a three-dimensional game (dealing with the threat of Starvation, Carnivores, and Climate effects) while increasing the vividness of the theme. It adds additional layers into what was already a dynamically strategic game.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	6	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/hs1P4qPgDKHXct3qs4JWGg__original/img/Do6E6XHAwbYvjH0Tb8n0G2DAlkA=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2876816.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/hs1P4qPgDKHXct3qs4JWGg__thumb/img/WUTqvVmA5QUW5KJ9wVF4FdnziI0=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2876816.jpg
603	246684	Smartphone Inc.	In Smartphone Inc., you become a CEO of one of the largest smartphone-producing companies in the time when smartphones were only beginning to conquer the world. Research technologies, develop your factory, build your worldwide office network, and outprice your competitors to become the most profitable and successful smartphone company in the world.&#10;&#10;Smartphone Inc. is an economic simulation Eurogame. Over five rounds, players program their decisions about price, production, research, and expansion. The game features a unique mechanism of planning, which combines patching mechanisms with bidding and action selection. Each of the rounds consists of eight simple phases: planning, pricing, production, development, research, expansion, selling, and profits.&#10;&#10;In the planning phase, all players simultaneously make decisions for the next year by overlaying (&quot;patching&quot;) their two plan cards and all of their development tiles. The actions they plan on their cards and tiles in this phase will determine what actions they can perform during all of the later phases.&#10;&#10;In the pricing phase, players change the price they charge for their smartphones based on their plan. A lower price helps to go earlier and sell more smartphones on the market, but a higher price, while risky, helps players to earn more money.&#10;&#10;In production, all players produce smartphones.&#10;&#10;In development, players take development tiles, which expand their planning possibilities in future rounds.&#10;&#10;In research, players discover new technologies. Each technology not only expands players' ability to sell smartphones to customers, but also gives them special powers they can use during the game.&#10;&#10;In the expansion phase, players open offices in neighbor regions, which allow them to sell in that region and develop their network of offices to more regions in further turns.&#10;&#10;In the sale phase, players sell the phones they produced in regions where they have offices. But there is limited space in each region - and if your price is too high, cheaper rivals can block you from selling.&#10;&#10;In the profit phase, players get income for their sales. Players gain the sale prices for all of their sold smartphones, and the player who sold the most phones in each region gains a bonus for controlling the accessory market. At the end of this phase all sold smartphones are discarded from the map - and a new round begins.&#10;&#10;After five rounds, the richest player wins.&#10;&#10;	\N	1	5	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Ndctxvd7kBXYubeYRKRqzw__original/img/gGL8Fh-pFgTqB3lF-47ClLYLu8s=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4258616.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Ndctxvd7kBXYubeYRKRqzw__thumb/img/hJtPqShJYdb8DsdnTvpdkXrx-CU=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4258616.jpg
604	33160	Endeavor	It is a time when the maps of the world are still being filled in. Seagoing empires expand their frontiers by sending ships to the farthest reaches of the globe in search of new lands, new alliances, and new conquests. The wealth of the newly-discovered worlds abroad is a tempting prize for those with the strength and the cunning to seize it... and to hold it!&#10;You represent a growing empire engaged in a glorious endeavor to expand your&#10;influence and status at home and across the great oceans of the world. Through exploration and shipping, colonization and war, you will struggle with the other great powers to control the resources and the regions that unfold before you.&#10;&#10;The goal in Endeavor is to earn the most glory for your empire. Players earn glory by increasing their scores in Industry, Culture, Finance, and Politics, as well as by occupying cities, controlling connections between cities, and by holding certain Asset Cards and Building Tiles. Short-term goals of constructing useful buildings, gathering Trade Tokens, and obtaining Asset Cards must be balanced with the overall goal of attaining glory as you compete for control over the various regions of the world. The game only lasts seven rounds, and when it is over you want to be the one who has earned the most Glory points!&#10;&#10;Each round every player gets to build a new building, based on their Industry track. They then obtain new population markers based on their Culture track and retrieve used markers from building based on their Finance track. During the action phase, players take turns to either activate a building using a population marker or spend trade tokens to take an action: Ship, Occupy, Attack, Payment or Draw. Some buildings and tokens allow a player to take one or both of two actions. Shipping is used to open new regions for Occupation and Drawing, and gains you Trade Tokens. Once a shipping track is full, the player with the most influence in that region gains the powerful Governor card for that region. Occupation of a city results in glory and Trade Tokens, while Attacking steals a city from an opponent! Either Occupation or Attacking can result in claiming the connection between two cities, if both connected cities are controlled by the same player. Drawing gains a card from a region up to the maximum hand limit based on the player's Politics track. A player's influence in a region determines which cards they can draw. Once all players have passed, a new round begins.&#10;&#10;	\N	3	5	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/595ae0scpXIHHVHSc4xfwQ__original/img/SscwEt9ADd4Kk-nOow9WY_2rvbs=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic379881.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/595ae0scpXIHHVHSc4xfwQ__thumb/img/juQPKjimski28am3hhiCvvLMwvU=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic379881.jpg
605	17392	Here I Stand	Here I Stand: Wars of the Reformation 1517-1555 is the first game in over 25 years to cover the political and religious conflicts of early 16th Century Europe. Few realize that the greatest feats of Martin Luther, John Calvin, Ignatius of Loyola, Henry VIII, Charles V, Francis I, Suleiman the Magnificent, Ferdinand Magellan, Hern&aacute;n Cort&eacute;s, and Nicolaus Copernicus all fall within this narrow 40-year period of history. This game covers all the action of the period using a unique card-driven game system that models both the political and religious conflicts of the period on a single point-to-point map.&#10;&#10;There are six main powers in the game, each with a unique path to victory:&#10;&#10;    The Ottomans&#10;    The Habsburgs&#10;    The English&#10;    The French&#10;    The Papacy&#10;    The Protestants&#10;&#10;&#10;Here I Stand is the first card-driven game to prominently feature secret deal-making. A true six-sided diplomatic struggle, the game places a heavy emphasis on successful alliance-building through negotiations that occur away from the table during the pre-turn Diplomacy Phase. Set during the period in which Niccol&ograve; Machiavelli published his masterpiece &quot;The Prince,&quot; backstabbing is always possible, especially because the card deck is loaded with event and response cards that can be played by any power to disrupt the plans of the powers in the lead.&#10;&#10;Here I Stand integrates religion, politics, economics, and diplomacy in a card-driven design. Games vary in length from 3&ndash;4 hours for a tournament scenario up to full campaign games that run about twice the time. Rules to play games with 3, 4, or 5 players are also included. The 3-player game is just as well balanced as the standard 6-player configuration, taking advantage of the natural alliances of the period.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	6	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/SaJz1vt6j4njvkhDaplSHA__original/img/Jc0tqHtksdpScZjgiolbuj9Gupo=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic353047.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/SaJz1vt6j4njvkhDaplSHA__thumb/img/F8ii_yYy1gy3M5vQmq1SexxTM88=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic353047.jpg
606	70323	King of Tokyo	In King of Tokyo, you play mutant monsters, gigantic robots, and strange aliens&mdash;all of whom are destroying Tokyo and whacking each other in order to become the one and only King of Tokyo.&#10;&#10;At the start of each turn, you roll six dice, which show the following six symbols: 1, 2, or 3 Victory Points, Energy, Heal, and Attack. Over three successive throws, choose whether to keep or discard each die in order to win victory points, gain energy, restore health, or attack other players into understanding that Tokyo is YOUR territory.&#10;&#10;The fiercest player will occupy Tokyo, and earn extra victory points, but that player can't heal and must face all the other monsters alone!&#10;&#10;Top this off with special cards purchased with energy that have a permanent or temporary effect, such as the growing of a second head which grants you an additional die, body armor, nova death ray, and more.... and it's one of the most explosive games of the year!&#10;&#10;In order to win the game, one must either destroy Tokyo by accumulating 20 victory points, or be the only surviving monster once the fighting has ended.&#10;&#10;First Game in the King of Tokyo series&#10;&#10;	\N	2	6	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/m_RzXpHURC0_xLkvRSR_sw__original/img/hSvWgiRYJCTTuoLOWTW3c8sYtl8=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3043734.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/m_RzXpHURC0_xLkvRSR_sw__thumb/img/OfgWmkGJj5BgOO0zFHEtP5CHfbU=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3043734.jpg
607	21348	Ticket to Ride: Märklin	Ticket to Ride: M&auml;rklin is the third installment in Days of Wonder's best-selling Ticket to Ride series.  The board for M&auml;rklin is based on a map of Germany and each individual card in the deck depicts a different M&auml;rklin Trains model.  A DVD introducing players to the M&auml;rklin line of model trains is included [Edit: DVD no longer included in recent runs.]&#10;&#10;M&auml;rklin is a heavier version in the TTR series, allowing players to not only travel from city to city but also from cities to countries. A new mechanic is also introduced in the form of passengers and merchandise tokens. When the game is set-up a series of merchandise values worth victory points are placed on nominated cities. The values of these tokens diminish when multiple tokens are present within a single city, requiring players to move quickly to capture the higher valued tokens.&#10;&#10;These tokens can be collected by the players by placing their Passengers (3 per player), which can be achieved at the end of a turn in which a player lays trains to enter the city in question. Once a passenger is in play a player can forfeit their regular turn to move a passenger. Moving along a player's own train network comes at no cost and allows a player to take the top merchandise token from each city that is passed through. A passenger can also move along sections of track featuring other players trains but a passenger card must be paid each time this occurs to do so.&#10;&#10;The player who completes the most destination tickets receives a 10 point bonus (instead of the base game's longest route bonus).&#10;&#10;	\N	2	5	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/hmjtcaumdyjW_Ncj1duAdw__original/img/xC_2Mn2Q9qVh4WPTcRT9MRTfSts=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic162026.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/hmjtcaumdyjW_Ncj1duAdw__thumb/img/94pMbGixwPxQamFIUyhhSydS9RY=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic162026.jpg

609	31594	In the Year of the Dragon	Stefan Feld's 3rd game by Alea is In the Year of the Dragon.&#10;&#10;Players take on the role of Chinese rulers around the year 1000. The game plays out in twelve rounds, with each round representing one month in a year that seems to go from bad to worse. Disease, drought, and attacks from the Mongols may claim lives, but make sure you have enough money to offer a tribute to the Emperor.&#10;&#10;The game play is easier than it may appear. Every player has a set of &quot;person&quot; cards. Each round, you choose one action (most of which call on your workers' abilities) to help you prepare for the months ahead. Then you play one person card, recruiting that person and placing him into one of your palaces. Each person brings different skills and abilities to help you ride out the year. (Farmers help you gain rice to survive a drought month, Tax Collectors raise money, etc.) At the end of each round, that month's event is triggered, which may cost you some of your workers, some money, or give you points.&#10;&#10;Careful planning is the key to surviving &quot;the year of the dragon,&quot; but survival alone may not win you the game.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	5	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/4X3HUNl0WsJnTcJYi7bu9Q__original/img/ZgRHDMms-Idk5Kh1YHfD61uQxXc=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic285822.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/4X3HUNl0WsJnTcJYi7bu9Q__thumb/img/VoGvu2BX5IyMRXZMRywYKuYqEaw=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic285822.jpg
610	15987	Arkham Horror	&#10;        The year is 1926, and it is the height of the Roaring Twenties. Flappers dance till dawn in smoke-filled speakeasies drinking alcohol supplied by rum runners and the mob. It's a celebration to end all celebrations in the aftermath of the war to end all wars.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;        Yet a dark shadow grows in the city of Arkham. Alien entities known as Ancient Ones lurk in the emptiness beyond space and time, writhing at the gates between worlds. These gates have begun to open and must be closed before the Ancient Ones make our world their ruined domination.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;        Only a handful of investigators stand against the Arkham Horror.  Will they Prevail? &#10;&#10;&#10;Arkham Horror is a cooperative adventure game themed around H.P Lovecraft's Cthulhu Mythos. Players choose from 16 Investigators and take to the streets of Arkham. Before the game, one of the eight Ancient Ones is chosen and it's up to the Investigators to prevent it from breaking into our world. During the course of the game, players will upgrade their characters by acquiring skills, allies, items, weapons, and spells. It's up to the players to clean out the streets of Arkham by fighting many different types of monsters, but their main goal is to close gates to other dimensions that are opening up around town. With too many gates open the Ancient One awakens and the players only have one last chance to save the world - defeat the Ancient One in combat!&#10;&#10;	\N	1	8	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/9cJf4kd_HZQo6NunfJlo9w__original/img/YA5R2ZUV2Zwt_fgXIxu8bii3OJ0=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic175966.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/9cJf4kd_HZQo6NunfJlo9w__thumb/img/6VzhMMmGOxNTCHQ-8iFdn5vINis=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic175966.jpg
611	265736	Tiny Towns	You are the mayor of a tiny town in the forest in which the smaller creatures of the woods have created a civilization hidden away from predators. This new land is small and the resources are scarce, so you take what you can get and never say no to building materials. Cleverly plan and construct a thriving town, and don't let it fill up with wasted resources! Whoever builds the most prosperous tiny town wins!&#10;&#10;In Tiny Towns, your town is represented by a 4x4 grid on which you will place resource cubes in specific layouts to construct buildings. Each building scores victory points (VPs) in a unique way. When no player can place any more resources or construct any buildings, the game ends, and any squares without a building are worth -1 VP. The player with the most VP wins!&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;	\N	1	6	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/aE1EoOzr530gQin8bj8QDA__original/img/-GDAsvmQ3wkuHaZ8h9G5Gk_nvVA=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4460401.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/aE1EoOzr530gQin8bj8QDA__thumb/img/AI-Ro3wLJtpyZLmCMNywOlpz0S8=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4460401.jpg
612	144592	Bruxelles 1893	Bruxelles 1893 is a worker placement game with elements of bidding and majority control. Each player is an architect of the late 19th century and is trying to achieve, through various actions, an architectural work in the Art Nouveau style. The most successful building yields the most points. Each player can also create works of art to increase his score.&#10;&#10;The action board is modular, with not every player having access to each action each turn. Some actions cost money &ndash; acquiring high-quality materials, building a level of your personal house, finding a patron, creating a work of art, selling that art for money and prestige &ndash; while other actions are free but can potentially cause you to lose one of your workers; these latter actions include acquiring low-quality materials, activating your patrons, visiting the stock exchange, and taking one of the actions with a cost. Once everyone has passed on taking more actions, the round ends and players have an art exhibition during which they can sell works. After this, players receive prestige points or bonus cards based on the symbols they've placed their workers next to on the action board.&#10;&#10;After five rounds, the game ends and players score bonus points based on their architect level, their bonus cards, how well they've completed their work, and their money on hand. The player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	5	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/sDga04VbcuQdapSSJme-Tg__original/img/eFuxK4c9VaTakN48H29ylNfY6Fc=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1726346.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/sDga04VbcuQdapSSJme-Tg__thumb/img/SUmDJc11Sw3bvV1r5q_mF1IfJjU=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1726346.jpg
613	236191	London (Second Edition)	A brand new edition of a popular classic, London will appeal to the strategic thinker among board game fans. Tasked with rebuilding London in the decades following the great fire, players juggle building requirements, bank loans, and poverty as they strive to realize their vision for the city.&#10;&#10;The game features a unique mechanism of playing cards to develop the city, then &quot;running&quot; the city by taking all the card actions simultaneously. Players have to repay all their loans before the game ends, but need to worry only about how much poverty they're creating relative to the other players.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/TMbEUs1GZpO96P5ubsqQew__original/img/SqRqsqHdyI0R04-efEQpIyzjbIA=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3693999.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/TMbEUs1GZpO96P5ubsqQew__thumb/img/7OZKGV67TxGK9cL5Kv7Kh2PbHFE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3693999.jpg
615	166669	San Juan (Second Edition)	San Juan is a card game based on Puerto Rico. The deck of 110 cards consists of production buildings (indigo, sugar, tobacco, coffee, and silver) and &quot;violet&quot; buildings that grant special powers or extra victory points. Cards from the hand can be either built or used as money to build something else; cards from the deck are used to represent goods produced by the production buildings, in which case they are left face-down. A seven-card hand limit is enforced once per round.&#10;&#10;In each round (or governorship), each player in turn selects from one of the available roles, triggering an event that usually affects all players, such as producing goods or constructing buildings. The person who picks the role gets a privilege, such as producing more goods or building more cheaply.&#10;&#10;Though similar in concept to Puerto Rico, the game has many different mechanisms. In particular, the game includes no colonists and no shipping of goods; goods production and trading are normally limited to one card per phase; and trades cannot be blocked. Victory points are gained exclusively by building, and the game ends as soon as one player has put up twelve buildings.&#10;&#10;This second edition of San Juan includes all the cards of the original game as well as the additional building cards from the alea Treasure Chest but not the event cards from that expansion. This edition also contains a new building card not previously available: &quot;The Hut,&quot; a building that grants a card when nothing is sold in the trader phase.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Upw8067nG8AmGvOfLYs1aQ__original/img/U26iPvrcmJeEsKeCIDCXbGFqB1U=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2305703.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Upw8067nG8AmGvOfLYs1aQ__thumb/img/3A0PXSduuqW0rejjc1tDegRxEG8=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2305703.jpg

618	274638	Unmatched: Robin Hood vs. Bigfoot	In battle, there are no equals.&#10;&#10;Unmatched is a highly asymmetrical miniature fighting game for two or four players. (Note that this set is solely for two players, but it can be combined with other sets, which all serve up to four players.) Each hero is represented by a unique deck designed to evoke their style and legend. Tactical movement and no-luck combat resolution create a unique play experience that rewards expertise, but just when you've mastered one set, new heroes arrive to provide all new match-ups.&#10;&#10;Robin Hood vs. Bigfoot features the titular heroes. Robin Hood and his outlaws excel at ranged attacks and robbing from their opponents. Bigfoot and his pal, the Jackalope, crash through the forest for quick attacks before disappearing like a figment of the mind.&#10;&#10;Combat is resolved quickly by comparing attack and defense cards. However, each card's unique effects and a simple but deep timing system lead to interesting decisions each time. The game also features an updated version of the line-of-sight system from Tannhauser for ranged attacks and area effects.&#10;&#10;The game includes a double-sided board with two different battlefields, pre-washed miniatures for each hero, and custom life trackers that's brought to life with the stunning artwork of Oliver Barrett and the combined design teams of Restoration Games and Mondo Games.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	2	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/5Fr8QPIazZRgEMnN2bwJ0g__original/img/si2jJWDVMO-EGy-r0RR7aVjLtO8=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4621589.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/5Fr8QPIazZRgEMnN2bwJ0g__thumb/img/wAEIsSjKsEHg_JVJ_adV6MvsJ4o=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4621589.jpg
619	71	Civilization	Civilization is a game of skill for 2 to 7 players. It covers the development of ancient civilizations from the invention of agriculture c. 8000 B.C. to the emergence of Rome around the middle of the third century B.C. Each player leads a nation of peoples over a map board of the Eastern Mediterranean and Near East as they attempt to carve a niche for themselves and their culture.&#10;&#10;Although battles and territorial strategy are important, this is not a war game because it is not won by battle or conquest. Instead, the object of play is to gain a level of overall advancement involving cultural, economic, and political factors so that such conflicts that do arise are a result of rivalry and land shortage rather than a desire to eliminate other players. Nomad and farmer, warrior and merchant, artisan and citizen all have an essential part to play in the development of civilization. It is the player who most effectively changes emphasis between these various outlooks who will achieve the best balance and win.&#10;&#10;(from the Introduction to the Avalon Hill edition rulebook)&#10;&#10;This game has a huge following and is widely regarded as one of the best games about ancient civilizations. Each player takes on the role of leader of an ancient civilization, such as the Illyrians or Babylonians. Your task is to guide your people through the ages by expanding your empire and using its proceeds to finance new technological advances, such as Literacy, Metalworking, or Law. The advancements help your civilization better cope with its problems as well as help bring new advancements.&#10;&#10;Civilization is widely thought to be the first game ever to incorporate a &quot;technology tree,&quot; allowing players to gain certain items and abilities only after particular other items were obtained. This influential mechanism has been adopted by countless other board games, card games, and computer games.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	7	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/YnRVKSq3NrLKVGPNzcYvqg__original/img/DVfIjAcXRotFftj6yPOc7KKYXNA=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic374847.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/YnRVKSq3NrLKVGPNzcYvqg__thumb/img/CUSJ06HO4-802yb7VSq_MgpOSpE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic374847.jpg
620	92415	Skull	Edited description from Bruno Faidutti's write-up of the game in his Ideal Game Library:&#10;&#10;Skull &amp; Roses is the quintessence of bluffing, a game in which everything is played in the players' heads. Each player plays a face-down card, then each player in turn adds one more card &ndash; until someone feels safe enough to state that he can turn a number of cards face up and get only roses. Other players can then overbid him, saying they can turn even more cards face up. The highest bidder must then turn that number of cards face up, starting with his own. If he shows only roses, he wins; if he reveals a skull, he loses, placing one of his cards out of play. Two successful challenges wins the game. Skull &amp; Roses is not a game of luck; it's a game of poker face and meeting eyes.&#10;&#10;Skull &amp; Roses Red features the same gameplay as Skull &amp; Roses, with the only change being alternate rules that allow each player to control two biker gangs. Both Skull &amp; Roses Red and Skull are playable on their own, with each game containing six different biker gangs. Each Skull or Skull &amp; Roses set can be combined with another to allow for games with more than six players.&#10;&#10;	\N	3	6	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/OPrd2iXm43dir7BwKAMOuQ__original/img/ygPnbmg8FCpA7jO5gXw38uyNQ10=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic6097488.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/OPrd2iXm43dir7BwKAMOuQ__thumb/img/yEnb4YWN-Cp41KWTQ2EeNkrqlZI=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6097488.jpg

If anyone can turn this tiny town into a thriving civic center it's you.&#10;&#10;In Sprawlopolis, 1-4 players work together to build a new city from the ground up. Using only 18 cards and a variable scoring system, the game is never the same twice. Each turn, players will play 1 card from their hand to the growing city, trying to score as many points as possible. Players will have to communicate and plan without revealing their own cards in order to most efficiently develop large areas in each of the 4 zone types. Watch out though, the city hates paying for road maintenance so each road will cost you points in the end. When all cards have been placed, the game ends and players see if they have met dynamically generated minimum score for their game.

626	154809	Nippon	Japan during the Meiji period&mdash;a closed, isolated, and feudal country&mdash;decides to change into a modern industrialized state. The Empire sends emissaries to foreign nations, brings technicians and scholars from the west, builds a network of railroads, and achieves an outstandingly fast industrial revolution.&#10;&#10;The nation and Emperor count on the support of the Great Four, the big conglomerates that emerge with great power and massive control over the Japanese economy. They are called Zaibatsu, and their influence on the Meiji Emperor and importance on the fate of Japan is incredibly high.&#10;&#10;Nippon is an Area Majority Game in which players control Zaibatsu and try to develop their web of power by investing in new industries, improving their technological knowledge, shipping goods to foreign countries or using them to satisfy local needs, and growing their influence and power as they oversee the era of rapid industrialization of Japan.&#10;&#10;The foundations of the big Zaibatsu were the traditional silk workshops, but soon the conglomerates diversified their influence and power, building a complex structure of interconnected companies that made them giant players in the world&rsquo;s new industrial era. Each player takes the reins of one of these big corporations and tries to develop it in order to grow and achieve power.&#10;&#10;To win the game, players must carefully choose which types of industry to invest in to get the most influence over the Japanese islands. Every action that is taken helps to forge their own path to new opportunities.&#10;&#10;Nippon is a fast-paced economic game with challenging decisions, set during an important time in Japanese history, and when a new great nation is born.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/DVJamHS1e24-scuM8aRH8g__original/img/SZFgBrff-aSpci1q4PsLat9Z4sI=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2683981.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/DVJamHS1e24-scuM8aRH8g__thumb/img/GfDVi8Cdml30yla1ui0y3exXG7g=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2683981.jpg

628	229220	Santa Maria	Santa Maria is a streamlined, medium complexity Eurogame in which each player establishes and develops a colony. The game features elements of dice drafting and strategic engine building. The game is low on luck and has no direct destructive player conflict; all components are language independent.&#10;&#10;In the game, you expand your colony by placing polyominoes with buildings on your colony board. Dice (representing migrant workers) are used to activate buildings; each die activates a complete row or column of buildings in your colony. The buildings are activated in order (left to right / top to bottom), then the die is placed on the last activated building to block this space. It is therefore crucial where you put new buildings in your colony, and in which order you use the dice.&#10;&#10;As the game progresses, you produce resources, form shipping routes, send out conquistadors, and improve your religious power to recruit monks. When you recruit a monk, you must decide if it becomes a scholar (providing a permanent special ability), a missionary (for an immediate bonus) or a bishop (for possible end game points). The player who has accumulated the most happiness after three rounds wins. The available specialists, end game bonuses and buildings vary from game to game, which makes for near endless replayability.&#10;&#10;	\N	1	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/bpwAMn7t9LnBQKFJw6VNPg__original/img/6tMXw9izC_uv_AJLOLztsqNPW3o=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3882016.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/bpwAMn7t9LnBQKFJw6VNPg__thumb/img/S-tPq43ITn88ppHjIbi8eaIbOX8=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3882016.jpg
629	128671	Spartacus: A Game of Blood and Treachery	In Spartacus: A Game of Blood &amp; Treachery, an exciting game of twisted schemes and bloody combats inspired by the hit STARZ Original series, each player takes on the role of Dominus, head of a rising house in the ancient Roman city of Capua. Each house is competing for Influence to gain the favor of Rome. Through a combination of political schemes and glorious battles on the arena sands your house will rise in fame and stature. As Dominus, you have a variety of resources at your disposal. Guards protect you from schemes launched by rivals. Slaves run your household and earn gold. Gladiators compete to bring glory to themselves and influence to their Dominus.&#10;&#10;Three main phases occur in each game round of Spartacus: A Game of Blood &amp; Treachery.&#10;&#10;The Intrigue Phase is when players launch their Schemes, hoping to raise their fortunes while undermining their rivals.  Schemes and Reactions are represented by cards in the Intrigue Deck. Players wield their Influence to put their Schemes into play, often asking for (or bribing) another player&rsquo;s help in hatching the most complex plots.&#10;&#10;The Market Phase is when players buy, sell and trade Assets (Gladiators, Slaves, Equipment and Guards). Players also bid against each other to acquire new Assets at Auction. Wealth is not the only path to success as players bluff and bargain with each other to acquire the Assets they covet.&#10;&#10;The Arena Phase is when the bloody games are held. Gladiators from two rival Houses are pitted against each other in a brutal fight for glory. The spectacles of the games are represented by miniature combat on the arena board. Fighters pit their Attack, Defense and Speed dice against one another to determine the victor. All players seek to increase their fortunes by betting on the outcome of the gruesome conflict. Fighters who emerge from the arena victorious gain Favor and their Dominus gain Influence.&#10;&#10;The goal of the game is to become the most influential house in Capua, securing your family&rsquo;s power for years to come.  During the game, players will bribe, poison, betray, steal, blackmail, and undermine each other. Gold will change hands again and again to buy support, stay someone&rsquo;s hand or influence their decisions. Will you be the honorable player whose word is their bond or the treacherous schemer whose alliances change with the wind?&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;	\N	3	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/_nPXf80oO-wC8eW2drZx1Q__original/img/ZAOE10XXVdOq92w-vmFk9aTaDAc=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic6166144.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/_nPXf80oO-wC8eW2drZx1Q__thumb/img/jxw0q-ua1ix06a8HUM0X5FLpHJA=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6166144.jpg
630	40765	Clash of Cultures	From Christian Marcussen, the creator of Merchants and Marauders, comes Clash of Cultures, a civilization game in which each player leads a civilization from a single settlement to a mighty empire. Players must explore their surroundings, build large cities, research advances and conquer those who stand in the way. The game features a modular board for players to explore, 48 distinct advances, seven mighty wonders, and loads of miniatures and cards. The winner will create a culture that will be remembered and admired for millennia.&#10;&#10;Advances&#10;The game features about 48 distinct advances. The whole &quot;tech-tree&quot; is very flexible with no dead ends, yet still intuitive, sensible and &quot;realistic.&quot; Additionally you have a great overview of what advances other cultures have - no need to ask - just look.&#10;&#10;Modular Board&#10;Players start with a civilization in its infancy. Move settlers to uncharted regions and reveal the terrain and its resources. Several mechanisms have been implemented to assure that an unlucky placement of region-tiles won't be a decider.&#10;&#10;Playing Time&#10;The game covers a time span similar to AH Civilization - that is to pre-gunpowder. This epic game is playable in about an hour per player! This is a pretty good playing time for a game that covers so much ground as this game will.&#10;&#10;City management&#10;Players expand their cities through the game. But not just to the generic larger city. Players instead choose a building type which represents the growth of the city. For instance you can expand a city with a port, fort, temple and academy - all with different benefits! Additionally cities can be &quot;angry,&quot; &quot;neutral&quot; and &quot;happy.&quot; Everything integrated in an intuitive and elegant fashion.&#10;&#10;Multiple paths to victory&#10;Earn points through:&#10;- Founding cities and increasing their sizes&#10;- Advances&#10;- Objectives &#10;- Wonders&#10;- Events&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/XHTMyEGDsNHLKXkbGDKaKA__original/img/GKb17ffVsXR5RFKmKE5OTT8O21U=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1351042.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/XHTMyEGDsNHLKXkbGDKaKA__thumb/img/mf5yep4EN9ZQP5hId2GsPB9zduo=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1351042.jpg
631	170771	Sword & Sorcery	Description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;Sword &amp; Sorcery is an epic-fantasy cooperative board game in which 1-5 players fight together against the forces of evil, which are controlled by the game system itself.&#10;&#10;Each player controls one or more heroes &ndash; legendary characters brought back to life by powerful sorcery. Weakened by the resurrection, they grow stronger during their story-driven quests. By acquiring soul points during battles, the heroes' souls regenerate, restoring their legendary status with multiple powers, magic and soul weapons, and powerful artifacts.&#10;&#10;Designed by Gremlin Project (the same team who created Galaxy Defenders),  the game system in Sword &amp; Sorcery represents the perfect evolution of its forerunner. Gameplay is faster and dynamic, thanks to an innovative area movement and area control system, with new features never seen before in a game of this category.&#10;&#10;Key features of Galaxy Defenders are also preserved in Sword &amp; Sorcery, such as the advanced AI system for monsters, a high degree of character customization, and the multiple tactical options during battles. Sword &amp; Sorcery packs, in a top-quality board game format, all the excitement of the best MMORPGs and action RPGs, to provide the ultimate heroic fantasy board game adventure.&#10;&#10;This base game contains ACT I of II.&#10;&#10;	\N	1	5	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/FNVnu-vB8WjyQTf63Ssvig__original/img/3zH2RQ0XlYefsMEa1Om1bnjNFS4=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2673763.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/FNVnu-vB8WjyQTf63Ssvig__thumb/img/byFYJhsrFZ3Z5rd0Ef72GxmYoqM=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2673763.jpg

Each player has a runner on the racetrack and a support team, which is represented by all the dice you roll. Each turn, you roll dice and use their results to move along the racetrack, buy new dice, and use abilities &mdash; but you must be careful not to push your luck rolling too much or you could bust!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/_WY_JrQQRrSUlVof11hMpQ__original/img/x5IICp6q86ozlyzJjTcoNkMELnI=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic5226311.png	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/_WY_JrQQRrSUlVof11hMpQ__thumb/img/YBgLAPTM5xOW3fDj_if3-r3oDs0=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5226311.png

634	34219	Biblios	THE GAME CONCEPT&#10;You are an abbot of a medieval monastery competing with other abbots to amass the greatest library of sacred books. To do so, you need to have both the workers and resources to run a well-functioning scriptorium. To acquire workers and resources, you use a limited supply of donated gold. In addition, you must be on good terms with the powerful bishop, who can help you in your quest.&#10;&#10;OUTLINE OF GAME PLAY&#10;The object of the game is to score the most Victory Points. You win Victory Points by winning any of the 5 categories: Illuminators, Scribes, Manuscripts, Scrolls, and Supplies. You win a category by having the highest total number of workers (Scribes, Illuminators) or resources (Manuscripts, Scrolls, Supplies) in that category. This is determined by the numbers in the upper left corner on the cards. At the start of the game, each category is worth 3 Victory Points. As the game progresses, the values on the Value Board will change and some categories will become worth more or fewer Victory Points than others. The game is divided into 2 stages: a Donation stage and an Auction stage. During the Donation stage, players acquire free cards according to an established plan. In the Auction stage, players purchase cards in auction rounds. After the two stages, winners of each category are determined and Victory Points awarded. The player with the most Victory Points wins.&#10;&#10;GAME CHARACTERISTICS&#10;The game involves a good deal of strategic planning, some bluffing, and a little bit of luck. The rules are easy to understand, but you have to play it a few times to develop a playing strategy. It plays differently from 2-4 players, but each game is equally fun and challenging.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/w9pHmbMbHEFYtuOUcWcruA__original/img/jOmzNb1JROlzeqEmCDScX_IkHVU=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic759154.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/w9pHmbMbHEFYtuOUcWcruA__thumb/img/BYid-ptJy9xNI_kK3IDWOGLWJVM=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic759154.jpg
714	15985	Blood Bowl: Living Rulebook	Blood Bowl is the game of Rugby slash Football as imagined in a fantasy world of orcs, elves, beastmen and many other fantasy creatures. The game truly shines in a League format, where players gain experience and learn new skills as they play.&#10;&#10;The latest rules are now version 6.0. The biggest change is the new Inducement system that does an infinitely better job of balancing teams of different experience. All of the team rosters have also been tweaked, with the previous runaway leaders toned down to everyone else's level. And as a great benefit to teams feeling the need to start over after a first bad game, the Journeyman system ensures you will always have 11 players on the field.&#10;&#10;This game is a part of the Blood Bowl Series&#10;&#10;	\N	2	2	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Fw_eZNLNOLjRLA3Lo8GV2g__original/img/Ab1M1nXMsd5X9kJq-GiEZ355t-E=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic66287.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Fw_eZNLNOLjRLA3Lo8GV2g__thumb/img/Gls4J_y0NLrYnuniLRlWj9Jnd8E=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic66287.jpg
635	161614	Stockpile	Stockpile is an economic board game that combines the traditional stockholding strategy of buy low, sell high with several additional mechanisms to create a fast-paced, engaging and interactive experience.&#10;&#10;In Stockpile, players act as stock market investors at the end of the 20th century hoping to strike it rich, and the investor with the most money at the end of the game is the winner. Stockpile centers on the idea that nobody knows everything about the stock market, but everyone does know something. In the game, this philosophy manifests in two ways: insider information and the stockpile.&#10;&#10;First, players are given insider information each round. This information dictates how a stock&rsquo;s value will change at the end of the round. By privately learning if a stock is going to move up or down, each player has a chance to act ahead of the market by buying or selling at the right time.&#10;&#10;Second, players purchase their stocks by bidding on piles of cards called stockpiles. These stockpiles will contain a mixture of face-up and face-down cards placed by other players in the game. In this way, nobody will know all of the cards in the stockpiles. Not all cards are good either. Trading fees can poison the piles by making players pay more than they bid. By putting stocks and other cards up for auction, Stockpile catalyzes player interaction, especially when potential profits from insider information are on the line.&#10;&#10;Both of these mechanisms are combined with some stock market elements to make players consider multiple factors when selling a stock. Do you hold onto a stock in hopes of catching a lucrative stock split or do you sell now to avoid the potential company bankruptcy? Can you hold onto your stock until the end of the game to become the majority shareholder, or do you need the liquidity of cash now for future bidding? Do you risk it all by investing heavily into one company, or do you mitigate your risk by diversifying your portfolio?&#10;&#10;In the end, everyone knows something about the stock market, so it all comes down to strategy execution. Will you be able to navigate the movements of the stock market with certainty? Or will your investments go under from poor predictions?&#10;&#10;	\N	2	5	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/T7CvF_oFrEMNgS0Eyrbr5g__original/img/lJ0jHrlXH3mdtjM56LGUSmArmeQ=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2537618.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/T7CvF_oFrEMNgS0Eyrbr5g__thumb/img/8ebaZ-3iSTwY0mvlc8FFULp8B4k=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2537618.jpg
636	55670	Macao	At the end of the 17th century, Macao &ndash; the mysterious port city on the southern coast of China &ndash; is a Portuguese trading post in the Far East. The players take on the role of energetic and daring adventurers. Many exciting tasks and challenges await the players, whether they are a captain, governor, craftsman, or scholar. Those who chose the wisest course of action and have the best overall strategy will earn the most prestige at the end.&#10;&#10;Macao lasts twelve rounds, and in each round players select one new card from a display specific to that round, two of which were revealed at the start of the game and others that were revealed only at the start of the round. The deck of 96 cards includes all sorts of special abilities, with the more powerful actions costing more resources to put into play.&#10;&#10;One player rolls six different-colored dice, then each player selects two of those dice (possibly the same ones chosen by opponents), then places cubes equal to the number and color of the two dice on a personalized &quot;ship's wheel.&quot; For example, if a player chooses the blue die that shows a 5, he places five blue cubes on the ship's wheel position five spots away from the current round. (A player can never claim more cubes than the number of remaining rounds).&#10;&#10;Players rotate their ship's wheels each round, then use the cubes available to them in that round to perform various actions: activating cards selected in that round or earlier rounds, buying city quarters and collecting the goods located there, moving that player's ship around Europe to deliver those goods, acquiring gold coins, taking special actions with card previously activated, and advancing on a turn order track.&#10;&#10;Players score points by delivering goods, paying gold coins, using the powers on their cards, and building in Macao. Whoever has the most points at the end of twelve rounds wins.&#10;&#10;Macao is number 13 in the alea big box series, with an estimated difficulty on the alea scale of 6/10.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/jLpm4EaABRAIN7F1Uakfaw__original/img/sOEALnO3ZFAgPdQn5rTE7M4RuWs=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic665651.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/jLpm4EaABRAIN7F1Uakfaw__thumb/img/_DEcXV8qc02wb7cj20YIVtjDG1w=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic665651.jpg
637	66188	Fresco	In Fresco, players are master painters working to restore a fresco in a Renaissance church.&#10;&#10;Each round begins with players deciding what time they would like to wake up for the day. The earlier you wake up, the earlier you will be in turn order, and the better options you will be guaranteed to have. Wake up early too often, however, and your apprentices will become unhappy and stop working as efficiently. They would much rather sleep in!&#10;&#10;Then, players decide their actions for the turn, deploying their apprentice work force to various tasks. You'll need to buy paint, mix paint, work on painting the fresco, raise money (which you'll need to buy the aforementioned paint!) by painting portraits, and perhaps even send your apprentices to the opera in order to increase their happiness. Points are scored mostly by painting the fresco, which requires specific combinations of paints, so you'll need to buy and mix your paints wisely, in addition to beating other players to the paints and fresco segments you would like to paint.&#10;&#10;Fresco includes several expansion modules, so you can play without expansions for a lighter family game or add in expansions to vary play and increase the decision-making and difficulty, resulting in a very flexible game with a high replay value.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/DCVRR-zA7Jy9wjuZudTZ8w__original/img/dF1pDf3JLgqAdzD9uhy14Pd3yx8=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic714398.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/DCVRR-zA7Jy9wjuZudTZ8w__thumb/img/7-_wICvkH7Opfpkc4vkNYvubia4=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic714398.jpg
638	171	Chess	Chess is a two-player, abstract strategy board game that represents medieval warfare on an 8x8 board with alternating light and dark squares. Opposing pieces, traditionally designated White and Black, are initially lined up on either side. Each type of piece has a unique form of movement and capturing occurs when a piece, via its movement, occupies the square of an opposing piece. Players take turns moving one of their pieces in an attempt to capture, attack, defend, or develop their positions. Chess games can end in checkmate, resignation, or one of several types of draws. Chess is one of the most popular games in the world, played by millions of people worldwide at home, in clubs, online, by correspondence, and in tournaments. Between two highly skilled players, chess can be a beautiful thing to watch, and a game can provide great entertainment even for novices. There is also a large literature of books and periodicals about chess, typically featuring games and commentary by chess masters.&#10;&#10;The game has its origins in the Indian game Chaturanga, and became Shatranj when introduced to the Persians. The current form of the game emerged in the second half of the 15th century when the Persians brought Shatranj to Southern Europe. The tradition of organized competitive chess began in the 16th century. The first official World Chess Champion, Wilhelm Steinitz, claimed his title in 1886. The current World Champion is Ding Liren, China. Chess is also a recognized sport of the International Olympic Committee.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	2	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/0-DjGBOko6RV8zg5ejhYIg__original/img/0pn_QgMuWaIJb2Q7aZNfORse0_o=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic260745.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/0-DjGBOko6RV8zg5ejhYIg__thumb/img/kjtoinSrkYV0HZleXMxkJzZwS8k=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic260745.jpg
726	191862	Imhotep	In Imhotep, the players become builders in Egypt who want to emulate the first and best-known architect there, namely Imhotep.&#10;&#10;Over six rounds, they move wooden stones by boat to create five seminal monuments, and on a turn, a player chooses one of four actions: Procure new stones, load stones on a boat, bring a boat to a monument, or play an action card. While this sounds easy, naturally the other players constantly thwart your building plans by carrying out plans of their own. Only those with the best timing &mdash; and the stones to back up their plans &mdash; will prove to be Egypt's best builder.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/HkAt5n4R8XM0vNozl7fftA__original/img/934t5i7J90wlw6mb6p2m_3u98i0=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3029488.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/HkAt5n4R8XM0vNozl7fftA__thumb/img/1JpxGZSWJf3mxnZZGaGOTqExoH4=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3029488.jpg
639	243	Advanced Squad Leader	Advanced Squad Leader is the completely reorganized and re-designed version of the original Squad Leader system. This three-ring binder is the basic rules for the entire system, and provides the ultimate combination of playability and detail. Full-color charts and beautiful pictures make this the most readable of rulebooks - and includes a full-service index as well for quick reference.&#10;&#10;And ASL is more than &quot;squads&quot; - the system includes the rules for everything from machine guns to bazookas, tanks and ordnance weapons, paratrooper drops, glider landings and beach assaults. And much more. This set of rules is constantly kept up to date by expansions included with the modules.&#10;&#10;ASL goals are scenario-defined, and vary from tasks such as exiting troops off of one edge of the board, to inflicting a certain number of casualty points on the opposing force, to capturing a certain number of goal buildings or areas.&#10;&#10;This is just the rulebook. To start playing the game the newcomer must get, at least, the Beyond Valor: ASL Module 1. There are a great many ASL Modules available. &quot;Core Modules&quot; provide additional rules, units from different nationalities, and additional geomorphic mapboards. &quot;Historical Modules&quot; provide campaign games simulating multi-day battles using actual historical maps rather than geomorphic mapboards, including additional rules, counters, and paper maps.

640	345584	Mindbug: First Contact	In Mindbug, you summon hybrid creatures and send them to battle against your opponent &mdash; but when you summon a creature, the opponent may use one of their Mindbugs to take control of it. Outwit your opponent in a fascinating tactical duel in which having the best cards and playing them at the wrong time can be deadly for yourself.&#10;&#10;Cards in Mindbug represent weird creatures that all come with unique and powerful abilities such as a Compost Dragon, a Snail Hydra, or a Kangasaurus Rex. Each player starts the game with ten creature cards (five in hand and five in a draw pile) and tries to use them to reduce the opponent's life total to zero. In addition, every player receives two Mindbug cards that can be used to mind control an opposing creature when it is played. This innovative Mindbug mechanism is the core of the game and leads to a unique decision-making process that makes Mindbug feel utterly different from any other card game.&#10;&#10;Playing a card doesn't require any resources in Mindbug. As a result, the game has no ramp-up phase (such as gathering resources) and doesn't require weak cards. Since there is also no deck-building, you can start playing right away from a single deck. There is also no unfair advantage as players draw cards from the same deck and always get the chance to mind control the strongest opposing cards. In the end, it all comes down to your own decisions, making the game extremely fair and competitive at the same time.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;	\N	2	2	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/b8gl6w-BqUVgBURdyFcFZg__original/img/chGo_gyJr418yMPchcWhLoW5AjQ=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic7646386.png	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/b8gl6w-BqUVgBURdyFcFZg__thumb/img/dCGADcFu3CrjHeao9JKibUHYUik=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7646386.png
641	262543	Wavelength	Wavelength is a social guessing game in which two teams compete to read each other's minds. Teams take turns rotating a dial to where they think a hidden bullseye is located on a spectrum. One of the players on your team &mdash; the Psychic &mdash; knows exactly where the bullseye is, and draws a card with a pair of binaries on it (such as: Job - Career, Rough - Smooth, Fantasy - Sci-Fi, Sad Song - Happy Song, etc). The Psychic must then provide a clue that is *conceptually* where the bullseye is located between those two binaries.&#10;&#10;For example, if the card this round is HOT-COLD and the bullseye is slightly to the &quot;cold&quot; side of the centre, the Psychic needs to give a clue somewhere in that region. Perhaps &quot;salad&quot;?&#10;&#10;After the Psychic gives their clue, their team discusses where they think the bullseye is located and turns the dial to that location on that spectrum. The closer to the center of the bullseye the team guess, the more points they score!&#10;&#10;	\N	2	12	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/z4fbPdmJg_5yphJEvql4ZA__original/img/bP1gM8RC-o5iz20_WazBaBNDHnU=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic4552862.png	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/z4fbPdmJg_5yphJEvql4ZA__thumb/img/bxLuHVLF-Y06jWRSKA-tuQ3YYcE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4552862.png
642	121	Dune	Set thousands of years in the future, Dune the board game is based on the Frank Herbert novels about an arid planet at the heart of the human space empire's political machinations.&#10;&#10;Designed by the creators at Eon of Cosmic Encounter fame, some contend that the game can best be described as Cosmic Encounter set within the Dune universe, but the two games bear little in common in the actual mechanisms or goals; they're just both set in space. Like Cosmic Encounter, it is a game that generates player interaction through negotiation and bluffing.&#10;&#10;Players each take the role of one of the factions attempting to control Dune. Each faction has special powers that overlook certain rules in the game. Each turn players move about the map attempting to pick up valuable spice while dealing with giant sandworms, deadly storms, and other players' military forces. A delicate political balance is formed amongst the factions to prevent any one side from becoming too strong. When a challenge is made in a territory, combat takes the form of hidden bids with additional treachery cards to further the uncertainty.&#10;&#10;The game concludes when one faction (or two allied factions) is able to control a certain number of strongholds on the planet.&#10;&#10;Note that the Descartes edition of Dune includes the Duel Expansion and Spice Harvest Expansion, the Landsraad variant from Avalon Hill's General magazine, and additional character disks not provided by AH.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	6	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/BU8s0uY97Hle4mqUOj8f1g__original/img/GJp5GfzIdwzPgQDXxpBjCPRP_K8=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic279251.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/BU8s0uY97Hle4mqUOj8f1g__thumb/img/xo_y6l4KldOtdTYUyXWO1yn4c0M=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic279251.jpg
643	36932	Claustrophobia	Claustrophobia is a miniatures-based survival game set within the universe of Hell Dorado.&#10;&#10;The box contains pre-painted miniatures which are placed on large tiles showing the dungeon spaces.  Also included are character boards, counters and markers, and dice.&#10;&#10;One player controls a small group of determined humans, while the other plays an almost unending army of demonic creatures.  The game is thematic and highly asymmetric: human characters are stronger, but the demon characters are more numerous.  Gameplay is very straightforward with a minimum of rules, and each game plays in an hour or less.&#10;&#10;Basically, dice are allocated after rolling to perform actions, while cards or special abilities are also available.  The game is about managing decisions and choosing what to do with the resources that you have, managing difficult events and out-thinking your opponent.  Combat is handled by dice.&#10;&#10;Complexity is low, with the focus on theme and building towards a tense, climactic ending. &#10; Claustrophobia is played through scenarios of which there are several in the rulebook.  Generally speaking, the human characters are attempting to complete a task (e.g. escape the catacombs, close a portal) while the demons are focused on stopping them.  There are varying win conditions depending on the scenario chosen.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	2	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/OUNLwXPLWGBgqlooTuADeQ__original/img/H5vpyvjR2NkRGDEXDrDBp3L56Kw=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic570518.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/OUNLwXPLWGBgqlooTuADeQ__thumb/img/_HYYNg_j_lEywSiF2PJEIS2_5WU=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic570518.jpg
644	186751	Mythic Battles: Pantheon	Hera, tired of Zeus' infidelity, decides to take her revenge and releases the Titans on Mount Olympus. In the ensuing battle, the power liberated by the combatants ignites in a combustion that shatters the Earth. In the ensuing deflagration, the weakest gods are obliterated, rendered down into the small fragments of power that constituted their being. The stronger ones were able to resist total annihilation but even their prodigious power could not save them entirely. As the survivors fell from the broken mountain, the shards of their divinity and the remnants of those that did not survive were scattered to the 4 corners of a now broken world.&#10;&#10;As they awoke, each god found themselves to be but a shadow of their former selves. They were still mighty, stronger than any mortal that yet walked but they were no longer all powerful, no longer immortal. Each one could sense the fragments of power that had now fallen to the Earth and that by collecting these they could regain their former grandeur and, if they could but amass enough, stand at the front of a new Pantheon, reshaped in their image.&#10;&#10;The world around them suffered as much as they did, the power released during the epic battle had ignited a cataclysm that reduced the beautiful land of Greece to a barren wasteland. Athens burns, Crete has sunken below the waves of the roiling seas and the immortal mount Olympus is now an ash covered wreck of its former glory. But this Event has not only affected the mortal realms. The underworld trembled from the blow even as a legion of fresh souls ran down the river Styx. Would that have been the extent of the underworld's involvement however...&#10;&#10;Hades, having lost the majority of his power, no longer holds sway over the Underworld. The gates of hell are open and even though the River Styx prevents the weakest souls from regaining the mortal world, the strongest warriors, the mightiest heroes and the most vicious monsters have managed to claw their way back up the Styx and back to the surface.&#10;&#10;As a new power struggle breaks out, Gods summon mortal survivors, returned heroes and reborn monsters to their side in their hunt for the shards of their lost power.&#10;&#10;In Mythic Battles: Pantheon, it is these clashes between warbands, in the midst of a post-apocalyptic ancient Greece, that are the focal point of the game. Choose your God, draft your warband and take the fight to your enemies with the might of the most powerful beings from Greek mythology at your back.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/au7lklR-A_0nnTskm4Vohw__original/img/zaRDFiH0FaeA_V73P-mpnKMfk9k=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3235453.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/au7lklR-A_0nnTskm4Vohw__thumb/img/MPylcXlXo-YF-rsanQIy9DaaGcs=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3235453.jpg

646	332686	John Company: Second Edition	In John Company, players assume the roles of ambitious families attempting to use the British East India Company for personal gain. The game begins in the early eighteenth-century, when the Company has a weak foothold on the subcontinent. Over the course of the game, the Company might grow into the most powerful and insidious corporation in the world or collapse under the weight of its own ambition.&#10;&#10;John Company is a game about state-sponsored trade monopoly. Unlike most economic games players often do not control their own firms. Instead, they will collectively guide the Company by securing positions of power, attempting to steer the Company&rsquo;s fate in ways that benefit their own interests. However, the Company is an unwieldy thing. It is difficult to do anything alone, and players will often need to negotiate with one another. In John Company, most everything is up for negotiation.&#10;&#10;Ultimately, this game isn&rsquo;t about wealth; it&rsquo;s about reputation. Each turn some of your family members may retire from their Company positions, giving them the opportunity to establish estates. Critically, players do not have full control over when these retirements happen. You will often need to borrow money from other players to make the best use for a chance of retirement. Players also gain victory points by competing in the London Season for prestige and securing fashionable properties.&#10;&#10;John Company engages very seriously with its theme. It is meant as a frank portrait of an institution that was as dysfunctional as it was influential. Accordingly, the game wrestles many of the key themes of imperialism and globalization in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries and how those developments were felt domestically. As such, this game might not be suitable for all players. Please make sure everyone in your group consents to this exploration before playing.&#10;&#10;The second edition is extensively revised and is not a reprint.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from designer&#10;&#10;	\N	1	6	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/TAdE4z_bwAAjJlmPrkmKhA__original/img/V5wLvuhU3mKNr6PUf1cxyeemh00=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic6601629.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/TAdE4z_bwAAjJlmPrkmKhA__thumb/img/pwgtQn8ArKjwBxk3bnDuIVAPWgU=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6601629.jpg

Each player starts with a basic deck of cards that they can use to purchase, or upgrade to, other, more powerful cards. Thunderstone Quest brings new play modes to the table. The game will tell a specific story with a series of pre-set dungeon tiles, monsters, heroes and support cards. Each will come with a series of mini-adventures and a story booklet that tells players what happens as they progress through the scenarios.&#10;&#10;Once players have completed the quests they will be able to enjoy great replay value with the available selection of monsters, heroes, and support cards, as well as the new dungeon tiles, by choosing random set-ups before the start of play. Aside from heroes such as wizards, fighters, rogues, and clerics, cards will include supplies that heroes need like weapons, spells, items, or light to reach further into the dungeon.&#10;&#10;The dungeon deck is created by combining several different groups of monsters together. Certain groups of monsters may be more or less susceptible to different hero types, so players have to take this into account when they choose what to buy.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/iNbiiQKqSfa4Eoq7U-O4Uw__original/img/xOr7JPv4PnikAfJkvfDS3FRUlhM=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3941484.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/iNbiiQKqSfa4Eoq7U-O4Uw__thumb/img/vpvEr_gA1fMhIgZwafl2oJBR_j4=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3941484.jpg

650	63628	The Manhattan Project	From the back of the box:&#10;&#10;Global Power Struggle Begins&#10;Which nation will take the lead and become world's dominant superpower?&#10;&#10;The Manhattan Project makes you the leader of a great nation's atomic weapons program in a deadly race to build bigger and better bombs. You must assign your workers to multiple projects: building your bomb-making infrastructure, expending your military to protect it, or sending your spies to steal your rival's hard work!&#10;&#10;You alone control your nation's destiny. You choose when to send out your workers&ndash;and when to call them back. Careful management and superior strategy will determine the winner of this struggle. So take charge and secure your nation's future!&#10;&#10;Additional description:&#10;&#10;The Manhattan Project is a low-luck, mostly open information efficiency game in which players compete to build and operate the most effective atomic bomb program. Players do not &quot;nuke&quot; each other, but conventional air strikes are allowed against facilities.&#10;&#10;The game features worker placement with a twist: there are no rounds and no end-of-round administration. Players retrieve their workers when they choose to or are forced to (by running out).&#10;&#10;An espionage action allows a player to activate and block an opponent's building, representing technology theft and sabotage.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	5	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/IFtZcDUsLDHpHpslQ-8Q8Q__original/img/1vLNKGGdXaI9yv4ENFud0oznh_s=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1222522.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/IFtZcDUsLDHpHpslQ-8Q8Q__thumb/img/fUVcaL3kLx-JXcjK4z4KnbABuLo=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1222522.jpg
651	100901	Flash Point: Fire Rescue	The call comes in... &quot;911, what is your emergency?&quot;  On the other end is a panicked response of &quot;FIRE!&quot; Moments later you don the protective suits that will keep you alive, gather your equipment and rush to the scene of a blazing inferno. The team has only seconds to assess the situation and devise a plan of attack &ndash; then you spring into action like the trained professionals that you are. You must face your fears, never give up, and above all else work as a team because the fire is raging, the building is threatening to collapse, and lives are in danger.&#10;&#10;You must succeed. You are the brave men and women of fire rescue; people are depending on you. This is what you do every day.&#10;&#10;Flash Point: Fire Rescue is a cooperative game of fire rescue.&#10;&#10;There are two versions of game play in Flash Point, a basic game and expert game.&#10;In both variants, players are attempting to rescue 7 of 10 victims from a raging building fire.&#10;As the players attempt to rescue the victims, the fire spreads to other parts of the building, causing structural damage and possibly blocking off pathways through the building.  Each turn a player may spend action points to try to extinguish fires, move through the building, move victims out of the building or perform various special actions such as moving emergency vehicles.  If 4 victims perish in the blaze or the building collapses from taking too much structural damage, the players lose.  Otherwise, the players win instantly when they rescue a 7th victim.&#10;&#10;The expert variant included in the game adds thematic elements such as flash over, combustible materials, random setup, and variations on game difficulty from novice to heroic.  The game includes a double sided board with two different building plans and several expansion maps are available.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	6	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/v6bTbxeprDFj1nN4AenvjA__original/img/ri91i22ujLCZqxXKhFIdVDPGe8Y=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1129370.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/v6bTbxeprDFj1nN4AenvjA__thumb/img/7AyBFA8JfZHKxC5ntwOjJTbIgWE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1129370.jpg

Everything you know and love could be destroyed by chaos and madness. Can you and your fellow investigators manage to find and seal every portal in time? Hurry before you lose yourself to insanity.&#10;&#10;In Pandemic: Reign of Cthulhu, you'll experience the classic Pandemic gameplay with an horrific twist that'll have you face twelve Old Ones, each threatening the world with their unique powers. As players take on the roles of investigators attempting to seal a series of portals before monsters of unspeakable horror pour into our world there is, of course, a high risk of the investigators losing their own minds.&#10;&#10;Instead of curing diseases like in the original Pandemic, players seal portals and shut down cults in the classic New England fictional towns of Arkham, Dunwich, Innsmouth, and Kingsport. Can you and your fellow investigators manage to find and seal every portal in time? Hurry before you lose yourself to insanity and the evil that lurks beneath your feet...&#10;&#10;Part of the Pandemic series.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/rwNaEQfzABp7dkpnwn1Ksw__original/img/NCSz1g5A1Dydfqlv68rbPEoRTes=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic2866737.png	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/rwNaEQfzABp7dkpnwn1Ksw__thumb/img/A77zWf8GZ3rPK5FPTitlJuTAoNM=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2866737.png
652	27162	Kingsburg	In Kingsburg, players are Lords sent from the King to administer frontier territories.&#10;&#10;The game takes place over five years, a total of 20 turns.  In every year, there are 3 production seasons for collecting resources, building structures, and training troops.  Every fourth turn is the winter, in which all the players must fight an invading army.  Each player must face the invaders, so this is not a cooperative game.&#10;&#10;The resources to build structures and train troops are collected by influencing the advisers in the King's Council.  Players place their influence dice on members of the Council. The player with the lowest influence dice sum will be the first one to choose where to spend his/her influence; this acts as a way of balancing poor dice rolling. Even with a very unlucky roll, a clever player can still come out from the Council with a good number of resources and/or soldiers.&#10;&#10;Each adviser on the King's Council will award different resources or allocate soldiers, victory points, and other advantages to the player who was able to influence him/her for the current turn.&#10;&#10;At the end of five years, the player who best developed his assigned territory and most pleased the King through the Council is the winner.&#10;&#10;Many alternate strategies are possible to win: will you go for the military way, disregarding economic and prestige buildings, or will you aim to complete the big Cathedral to please the King?   Will you use the Merchant's Guild to gain more influence in the Council, or will you go for balanced development?&#10;&#10;	\N	2	5	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/pHFQxD8va6vOrrNfazVzsg__original/img/LKINGoSbAufYYSAElNZDOubbYZg=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic253057.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/pHFQxD8va6vOrrNfazVzsg__thumb/img/C5cCKKfjEpm87frQIFOOYfzmIyc=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic253057.jpg

The game takes you from Starter Deck to Regionals in about 2-3 hours.&#10;&#10;Multiple games can also be chained together to form a Campaign, going from Regionals to Nationals in game 2 and from Nationals to Worlds in game 3, with each game introducing ever more powerful cards and higher stakes, but also resetting the power of the game so that each player has a fair chance to win each 'season' of the campaign.&#10;&#10;The game draws heavily on Manga/Anime inspiration for its art, and parodies Magic: the Gathering, Yugioh, and many other collectible games.&#10;&#10;At its heart, it&rsquo;s a commodity trading game, except that instead of cubes or stocks, the things you&rsquo;ll be buying, selling, and speculating on are trading cards that can be used throughout the game in periodic tournaments. By trading wisely, playing the market, working together with friends, building collections, and winning tournaments, you&rsquo;ll secure points and become the Millennium Blades World Champion.&#10;&#10;The game features a system of card pods, where you will play with about 400 of the base game&rsquo;s 600 cards every game.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	5	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/5h467xIvOqAE8YZdT3WH4w__original/img/nJh74imh83N69hX3QK0ED0Af2Gw=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic7455420.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/5h467xIvOqAE8YZdT3WH4w__thumb/img/QHATT9rshYO-_8qF3TH-x__iPnE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7455420.jpg

656	66362	Glen More	Each player represents the leadership of a 17th century Scottish clan looking to expand its territory and its wealth. The success of your clan depends on your ability to make the correct decision at the opportune time, be it by establishing a new pasture for your livestock, growing grain for the production of whisky, selling your goods on the various markets, or investing in the cultivation of special places such as lochs and castles.&#10;&#10;Glen More offers a unique turn mechanism. Players take territory tiles from a rondel. Picking a tile has not only influence on the actions you get by the surrounding tiles in your territory, it also determines when you'll have your next turn (and how many turns you will have in the game). But having a lot of turns is not always the best strategy for a successful chieftain.&#10;&#10;Glen More is 6 in the Alea medium box series, and is rated a 4 on the alea complexity level.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	5	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ApDYRpgfdCMhEszegyHiEA__original/img/TxrPXfITtOp4XAIjOHnu-TooQiY=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1013640.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ApDYRpgfdCMhEszegyHiEA__thumb/img/8E82w4RfXAuRIvmnPVGE0or3rQQ=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1013640.jpg
658	284742	Honey Buzz	The bees have discovered economics. The queens believe that if they sell honey to the bears, badgers, and woodland creatures, they will find peace and prosperity. Spring has arrived and it's time to build the hive, find nectar, make honey, and, for the first time ever, set up shop.&#10;&#10;Honey Buzz is a worker bee placement game where players expand a personal beehive by drafting various honeycomb tiles that grant actions that are triggered throughout the game. Each tile represents a different action. Whenever a tile is laid so that it completes a certain pattern, a ring of actions is triggered in whatever order the player chooses. A tile drafted on turn one could be triggered up to three times at any point during the game. It all depends on how the player places their beeples (bee+meeple) and builds their hive. After all, in the honey business, efficiency is queen.&#10;&#10;As you continually expand your hive, you'll forage for nectar and pollen, make honey, sell different varieties at the bear market, host honey tastings, and attend to the queen and her court. There's only so much nectar to go around, and finding it won't be easy. Players will have to scout out the nectar field and pay attention to other players searches to try to deduce the location of the nectar they need for themselves.&#10;&#10;	\N	1	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/q3KbDdmiSkvKucANAdOU1g__original/img/2mJguceZAdOqSem23FEHobaZ0a4=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5608344.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/q3KbDdmiSkvKucANAdOU1g__thumb/img/4e8jsNQHJp_Cir_h1_rEBK5xXWM=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5608344.jpg
659	256730	Pipeline	The refinement of oil has long been part of the government-controlled energy sector. Amassed with an incredibly complex and inefficient system of refineries, the government has felt the severe pressures of worldwide demand and the ever-increasing global standards for refinement. Unable to keep up with demand, the government has only one option: privatizing the oil industry.&#10;&#10;This is where you come in.

660	11170	Heroscape Master Set: Rise of the Valkyrie	This Fantasy Battle Board Game comes with dozens of painted plastic miniatures, each representing a warrior from a different era, and hex-based hard plastic terrain pieces which can be put together in many different ways. The warriors include 30 plastic figures, including World War II soldiers, futuristic robots, aliens, a T-Rex-riding orc, a large dragon, and many more.  Each hero or squad has its own card that details both movement and combat abilities.&#10;&#10;There are 2 large ruins and 85 tiles of terrain in the base game.  Some terrain tiles are large (up to 24 hexes) while others are small (1 hex).  There are water, sand, rock and grass tiles (in roughly increasing order).  Many different battlefields can be built by attaching and stacking the tiles.&#10;&#10;The rulebook features two games: a basic and a master version.  In the basic version (designed for younger players &lt; 8 years), characters move, attack, defend, and have range -- but there are no special powers and some other rules are minimized and/or eliminated.  The master game includes special powers, wounds, engagement rules, falling rules, and a few other additions.&#10;&#10;A battlefield/scenario book shows how to build five battlefields, layer by layer.  Each battlefield may have multiple scenarios, where the goals vary.  It can be opponent elimination, getting to a certain space, protecting a certain figure, or holding out for a certain number of turns.&#10;&#10;Each unit in the Master Set has a movement rating ranging from 4 to 8, which is the number of hexes it can move in a turn.  Moving up a level counts as a hex; moving down does not incur that penalty. Moving down more levels than your height when moving from one hex to another counts as falling and you might take damage --unless you are falling into water.&#10;&#10;Combat in the game is fairly straightforward.  You roll attack dice as listed on your unit's card (1 to 8 dice in the Master Set), and the opponent rolls defense dice equal to the number on their unit's card (1 to 9 dice).  Skulls rolled in excess of shields count as wounds (hero figures may have more than one Life).&#10;&#10;The master game uses a point system in which players alternate drafting cards until they reach the pre-assigned point value for the scenario.  It's possible to bring a &quot;pre-fab&quot; army to the battle in order to save time.&#10;&#10;The basic game is for two players. The master game is for 2 to 4 (and more) players.&#10;The game is eminently customizable, with many expansions which add more abilities, terrain, and options. There are also user-created maps, scenarios, custom units and advanced rules available online.&#10;&#10;HeroScape: Rise of the Valkyrie is the original master set for the HeroScape series of games.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/NexswDpzGPW3YGguz9Uhcg__original/img/0OPnke-YId5OHbri1KWn3ot98ns=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic244662.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/NexswDpzGPW3YGguz9Uhcg__thumb/img/mUDJhf8jTcxmSF9bFJYQm30IGt0=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic244662.jpg
661	350316	Wayfarers of the South Tigris	Wayfarers of the South Tigris is set during the height of the Abbasid Caliphate, circa 820 AD. As brave explorers, cartographers and astronomers, players set off from Baghdad to map the surrounding land, waterways, and heavens above. Players must carefully manage their caravan of workers and equipment, while reporting back regularly to journal their findings at the House of Wisdom. Will you succeed in impressing the Caliph, or lose your way and succumb to the wilderness?&#10;&#10;The aim of Wayfarers of the South Tigris is to be the player with the most victory points (VP) at the game's end. Points are primarily gained by mapping the land, water, and sky. Players can also gain points from upgrading their caravans, by gaining inspiration from nobles, and by influencing the three guilds of science, trade and exploration. As they make discoveries, players will want to quickly journal their progress. The game ends once one player&rsquo;s marker has reached the far right column of the journal track.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;	\N	1	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/bH-ThnratBE1MAB_KdgrWg__original/img/FMbwKz_hXrfQEPVfYe8U2nIOwyQ=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic7339734.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/bH-ThnratBE1MAB_KdgrWg__thumb/img/dCxGWUE0ReGJzdx3R_ZaOFwBWjE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7339734.jpg

663	96913	Lancaster	From the designer of Glen More comes a new title published by Queen Games: Lancaster.&#10;&#10;In 1413, the new king of England, Henry V of Lancaster, has ambitious plans: The unification of England and the conquest of the French crown! Each player takes the role of an ambitious aristocratic family. Who will be the best supporter of this young king, and the most powerful Lord of his time?&#10;&#10;In Lancaster, the players want to proceed from simply being a Lord to being the most powerful ally of the king. They may achieve this by developing their own knighthood, as well as by clever deployment of individual knights in the counties of England, at their own castle, and to conflicts with France. In parliament, they try to push laws from which they will benefit themselves most. The player with the most power points at the end of the game is the winner.&#10;&#10;Every turn, players send their knights to the different locations:&#10;&bull; Counties, where they compete with knights from other players for rewards and the favor of the nobles.&#10;&bull; The castle, to receive income or new knights.&#10;&bull; Into conflict with France, where all players combine their power and try to gain power points.&#10;&#10;In the counties, the strength of the knights is important, as you can remove the knight of another player by placing a knight of your own with higher strength in the same location.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	5	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/8e4XYBOnFKGMoiW591ih8g__original/img/_jhK5G6MPFMsEExIi_4j9JXf1SY=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1280761.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/8e4XYBOnFKGMoiW591ih8g__thumb/img/dsG2vzx6pcFyxghLg_dww9NcHOQ=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1280761.jpg
664	156858	Black Orchestra	As Hitler's grasp on Germany tightens and his maniacal fervor is unmasked, men from the highest levels of the Reich begin to plot his assassination. As the clock ticks and Hitler's ambitions grow, these daring few must build their strength and prepare for the perfect moment to strike. The Gestapo hound their trail, calling these conspirators &quot;Schwarze Kapelle&quot;, the Black Orchestra. Will this band of daring patriots save their country from utter ruin before it is too late?&#10;&#10;Black Orchestra begins with each player choosing a historic figure involved in the conspiracy against Hitler. In this dark and dangerous pursuit, motivation is perhaps your greatest weapon. If you can stay true to your convictions in the face of overwhelming threat and inspire your comrades, then you will be able to use your special ability, attempt plots, and even become zealous (necessary for some extremely daring plots).&#10;&#10;But every move you make may also increase the suspicion of the authorities. The Gestapo will make routine sweeps, and any players with high suspicion will be arrested and interrogated (possibly resulting in other players being arrested). If you are all arrested or if the Gestapo finds your secret papers, you lose. And the suspicion placed on each conspirator will increase the chances their plots are detected.&#10;&#10;On a turn, players may take three actions, such as moving, searching for an item, or drawing a card; or, at the cost of one action per die, roll the dice in an attempt to gain even more actions &mdash; at the risk of attracting the suspicion of the gestapo. This dice rolling &quot;Conspire&quot; action allows players to make bold moves when most needed.&#10;&#10;After the actions have been taken, an event card is drawn. The game is played over seven stages of World War 2, represented by seven stacks of event cards. These cards walk you through the events of WWII in a roughly (but not strictly) chronological order. New stages open up new areas of the board, cause Hitler and his deputies to interact with the Conspirators, and present various opportunities or threats. During the final stage, many board spaces become off-limits, as the Allies move closer to Germany.&#10;&#10;To win, players must collect a plot card and fulfill all necessary requirements listed (such as having Hitler be in a certain space and possessing certain items--detonator &amp; fuse, etc.). The active player may then attempt the plot by rolling the indicated dice, including all additional modifiers and helpful Action cards. The total of number of &quot;Target&quot; symbols needed to kill Hitler is based on Hitler's military support, but a Conspirator's security level decides if any &quot;Eagles&quot; rolled will see them detected, and foil the plot regardless. Players must consider their ability to successfully complete a plot and the relative suspicion levels of the different Conspirators involved.&#10;&#10;Players will need to work together and agree on the wisest course of action, as well as have a little luck, to succeed. The phenomenon of one player dominating the game because of its cooperative nature is mitigated by the fact that there are no certainties, and often a player will need to make a bold or reckless move to keep the conspiracy alive. Cool heads often prevail, but play it too cool and you may miss your chance. The co-operative dynamic gets really interesting if a player is ever arrested, and fails to resist interrogation, then they will need to make a big decision all by themselves, without revealing their options to the group. No one player can guarantee success. It is hoped that players will have tense conversations similar to those had by the real conspirators and enjoy a truly unique historical experience.&#10;&#10;	\N	1	5	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/mvE22ut60-N5qzhE9guINw__original/img/1GrE_UvDfOYRPMSqcv9DaKrJ-98=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic6973676.png	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/mvE22ut60-N5qzhE9guINw__thumb/img/Z2A_CL-vc5wS4_hUN2RhtGzMiC4=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6973676.png
665	79828	A Few Acres of Snow	A Few Acres of Snow is a two-player, deck-building Strategic level board-wargame about the French and British conflict in North America.&#10;&#10;The card-play contains a focus on a deck-building mechanic similar to Dominion, each card will have multiple uses like card-driven games. The players have to choose only one aspect of the card to use when it is played. Each space captured by a player will add another card to the capturing player's deck.&#10;&#10;From the box description:&#10;&#10;A war fought at the edge of two mighty empires. For over one hundred and fifty years Britain and France were locked in a struggle for domination of North America. Thousands of miles from their homes, settlers and soldiers were faced with impenetrable forests, unpredictable American tribes, and formidable distances. Despite these obstacles they were able to engage in bitter warfare, with the British ultimately taking the prize of Quebec. A Few Acres of Snow is a two-player game that allows you to recreate this contest. You can change the course of history by your decisions.&#10;&#10;A Few Acres of Snow takes an innovative approach to the subject, using cards to represent locations and manpower. As the game progresses you add to your selection of cards, increasing the range of actions available to you. There are many strategies to be explored. How quickly should you build up your forces, do you employ Native Americans, what energy should be expended on your economy?&#10;&#10;The game is about more than just fighting &ndash; you must successfully colonize the land to have a chance.&#10;&#10;Online Play&#10;&#10;     Yucata (turn-based)&#10;&#10;&#10;	\N	2	2	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/JcrBT921aDP9XTdDyKM_8g__original/img/OpBpj-eVDOaV0SWuixqaCzjoJ-w=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic905905.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/JcrBT921aDP9XTdDyKM_8g__thumb/img/MGcWqny1dKmspUxjIi2bpkitx7w=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic905905.jpg
666	264241	Mandala	The Mandala: the symbol of an ancient and sacred ritual. Colored sand is laid to create a symbolic map of the world before the pattern is ceremonially destroyed and the sand cast into the river.&#10;&#10;In the two-player game Mandala, you are trying to score more than your opponent by collecting valuable cards &mdash; but you won't know which cards are valuable until well into the game! Over the course of the game, players play their colored cards into the two mandalas, building the central shared mountains and laying cards into their own fields. As soon as a mandala has all six colors, the players take turns choosing the colors in the mountain and adding those cards to their &quot;river&quot; and &quot;cup&quot;. At the end of the game, the cards in your cup are worth points based on the position of their colors in that player's river. The player whose cup is worth more points wins.&#10;&#10;The linen playmat shows two circular mandalas, with each being divided by a horizontal space (the mountain) to create one &quot;field&quot; for each player. The playmat has seven spaces in front of each player to hold their river of single face-up cards and their cup: the stack of face-down cards which they score at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;To begin, each player receives a hand of six cards. Each player receives two random cards face down in their cup, then two random cards are dealt face up into the central mountain strip of each mandala.&#10;&#10;On your turn, you may play either a single card into one of mountains, or one or more matching cards into one of your fields. All cards played into a mandala must follow the &quot;Rule of Color&quot;: Once a color has been played into one of the three areas of a mandala, then later cards of the same color can be played only into that same area. Thus, once your opponent has played red cards into their field, then you can't play red cards in your field, and neither you nor your opponent can play red cards into the central mountain. If you played a card into a mountain, draw three new cards from the deck at the end of your turn; if you played cards into one of your fields, do not draw new cards.&#10;&#10;A mandala is completed once it contains all six colors of cards. When this happens, the players &quot;destroy&quot; the mandala, taking turns to choose a color present in the mountain and claim all cards of that color. Whoever played more cards in their field chooses first; if tied, the player who did not complete the mandala chooses first. The first time you claim cards of a specific color, lay one of these cards in the lowest-valued empty space in your river, then place the rest into your cup. The spaces in your river are valued 1-6 in order, so cards of the first color you claim will be worth 1 point each, cards of the second color you claim worth 2 points each, and so on.&#10;&#10;Once a mandala has been destroyed and all the colors in the mountain claimed, cards played in the fields are discarded, two new cards are dealt face up into the mountain, and the game continues.&#10;&#10;The end of the game is triggered either when the deck is exhausted or when one player adds a sixth color to their river. Both players then tally the value of all the cards in their cup, based on the position of the colors in their river, and whoever has the higher score wins!&#10;&#10;Contents:&#10;&#10;     1 linen playmat&#10;     108 mandala cards (18 in each of 6 colours)&#10;     2 reference cards&#10;&#10;&#10;	\N	2	2	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/FZUJ_Ieaw83mpz1eL-dY_g__original/img/FvjnGQH9SpkJ9_FB4frouPOe064=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5056121.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/FZUJ_Ieaw83mpz1eL-dY_g__thumb/img/o8B080rjfGtNloX7wMa_IRthuXo=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5056121.jpg

668	176396	Quadropolis	Each player builds their own metropolis in Quadropolis (first announced as City Mania), but they're competing with one another for the shops, parks, public services and other structures to be placed in them.&#10;&#10;The game lasts four rounds, and in each round players first lay out tiles for the appropriate round at random on a 5x5 grid. Each player has four architects numbered 1-4 and on a turn, a player places an architect next to a row or column in the grid, claims the tile that's as far in as the number of the architect placed (e.g., the fourth tile in for architect #4), places that tile in the appropriately numbered row or column on the player's 4x4 city board, then claims any resources associated with the tile (inhabitants or energy).&#10;&#10;When a player takes a tile, a figure is placed in this now-empty space and the next player cannot place an architect in the same row or column where this tile was located. In addition, you can't place one architect on top of another, so each placement cuts off play options for you and everyone else later in the round. After all players have placed all four architects, the round ends, all remaining tiles are removed, and the tiles for the next round laid out.&#10;&#10;After four rounds, the game ends. Players can move the inhabitants and energy among their tiles at any point during the game to see how to maximize their score. At game end, they then score for each of the six types of buildings depending on how well they build their city &mdash; as long as they have activated the buildings with inhabitants or energy as required:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Residential buildings score depending on their height&#10;    Shops score depending on how many customers they have&#10;    Public services score depending on the number of districts in your city that have them&#10;    Parks score depending on the number of residential buildings next to them&#10;    Harbors score based on the longest row or column of activated harbors in the city&#10;    Factories score based on the number of adjacent shops and harbors&#10;&#10;&#10;Some buildings are worth victory points (VPs) on their own, and once players sum these values with what they've scored for each type of building in their city, whoever has the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/y7kVtuCs6EfItCGUloqBAA__original/img/vRPabR3wug71QB2mHCx-0BnairI=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2840020.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/y7kVtuCs6EfItCGUloqBAA__thumb/img/SGHJzA_0kYlRzeWTi5s_4JB_EPY=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2840020.jpg
670	276182	Dead Reckoning	Dead Reckoning is a game of exploration, piracy, and influence based in a Caribbean-esque setting. Each player commands a ship and crew and seeks to amass the greatest fortune. They do this through pirating, trading, treasure hunting, and (importantly) capturing and maintaining control over the uninhabited but resource-rich islands of the region. During the game, you can:&#10;&#10;&bull; Customize your ship: Your ship is represented by a token on the board. The board starts mostly unexplored and will be revealed as you venture into uncharted waters. You also have a ship board where you load cargo and treasure, and you can customize the guns, speed, or holding space of your ship.&#10;&#10;&bull; Card-craft your crew: You have a small deck of cards that will drive your actions in the game, with each card representing one of your crew members. This deck functions like one in a deck-building game, but the cards in the deck are sleeved, and rather than add new crew cards to your deck, you improve the skill and abilities of your crew cards by placing transparent &quot;advancement&quot; cards in those sleeves. Aside from the transparent advancements, your crew will also &quot;level up&quot; naturally during the game using a new card-leveling mechanism not seen in other card-crafting games such as Mystic Vale.&#10;&#10;&bull; Control the region: The region is filled with many deserted islands. These islands are a major source of treasure, and players will battle for control of these islands.&#10;&#10;&bull; Battle via a dynamic cube-tower: You can battle other players' ships or NPC merchant ships, and these battles are resolved via a new take on what a cube tower can be, with crew cards and ship powers increasing your chances of victory.&#10;&#10;&bull; Uncover secrets of the sea: Expansions for Dead Reckoning use a &quot;saga&quot; system in which certain content remains hidden and is discovered and added to the game organically only via playing. Rather than add everything at once, you gradually add it by playing and discovering. Depending on luck and player choice, less or more new content may get added each game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;	\N	1	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/4q_5Ox7oYtK3Ma73iRtfAg__original/img/67KL6z6m8eD2MprJ7JfsxXoAPlM=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4650725.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/4q_5Ox7oYtK3Ma73iRtfAg__thumb/img/TU4UOoot_zqqUwCEmE_wFnLRRCY=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4650725.jpg

677	137408	Amerigo	In Amerigo, the players help Amerigo Vespucci on his journey to discover new land. The players explore the islands of South America, secure trading routes, and build settlements.&#10;&#10;The actions available to players are determined through the use of a specialized cube tower, which has appeared in the Queen titles Im Zeichen des Kreuzes and Wallenstein. At the start of the game, this tower is seeded with action cubes, which come in seven colors, with each color matching a particular type of action. During the game players will drop additional action cubes into the tower &ndash; but some of these cubes might get stuck in the floors of the tower while other cubes already in the tower are knocked free. Thus, players need to play both tactically &ndash; taking advantage of the actions currently available in the best way possible &ndash; and strategically &ndash; using their knowledge of which actions do what to play well over the course of the game.&#10;&#10;The game board is composed of nine, twelve or sixteen tiles, depending on the number of players. Players sail their ships through the landscape created for this game, landing on islands to plan and build settlements, which then supply resources and allow the player to earn victory points. Players might want to invest in cannons to protect themselves from pirates roaming the waters or acquire progress tokens to gain special advantages.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/CPTCRbcUGvW-gepKwTvjSg__original/img/s0CSe2HK5xYB5aFR3WUqJAZRAn8=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1824151.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/CPTCRbcUGvW-gepKwTvjSg__thumb/img/zRh81ru4inGKVa5BA4_kIY5Xewg=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1824151.jpg
678	233312	Stuffed Fables	Stuffed Fables is an unusual adventure game in which players take on the roles of brave stuffies seeking to save the child they love from a scheming, evil mastermind. Make daring melee attacks, leap across conveyor belts, or even steer a racing wagon down a peril-filled hill. The game delivers a thrilling narrative driven by player choices. Players explore a world of wonder and danger, unlocking curious discoveries. The chapters of Stuffed Fables explore the many milestones of a child's life, creating a memorable tale ideal for families, as well as groups of adults who haven't forgotten their childlike sense of wonder.&#10;&#10;Stuffed Fables is the first &quot;AdventureBook Game&quot;, a new product line from Plaid Hat Games in which all of the action takes place in the unique storybook &mdash; a book that acts as your rules reference, story guide, and game board, all in one! Each adventure in the game takes place over several pages of the immersive AdventureBook. The book opens flat onto the table to reveal a colorful map or other illustration central to playing the game, with choices, story, and special rules on the opposite page.&#10;&#10;On their turn, a player draws five dice from the bag. The colors of the dice drawn determine the types of actions and options available to the player. White dice can re-stuff stuffies injured in battle. Red dice perform melee attacks while green dice perform ranged attacks. Yellow dice search while blue dice are used for special actions and purple dice can be used as any color. Most dice can always find a strategic use, including moving, using items, or contributing to group tasks. Players can store dice for later, combine dice for stronger actions, or use them one-at-a-time for multiple activations. As turns go by, black dice are also drawn, and after enough appear, minions emerge or attack, and the dice bag is reset!&#10;&#10;Players can encourage each other by sharing dice or their precious stuffing. In addition to fighting minions, each page of the storybook offers numerous points of interest, charming characters to interact or trade with, as well as many unusual challenges. And each page is but one chapter that folds into a branching, overarching story with a multitude of items and a special discovery deck full of surprises.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/CS83e1WOA5WMc4izRw6zwg__original/img/t8rrl-N63ofmYHV3_QTNGtkywOk=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3708878.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/CS83e1WOA5WMc4izRw6zwg__thumb/img/S8F7Wyt0tUKzok9xKx4-f4IegRE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3708878.jpg
679	158899	Colt Express	On the 11th of July, 1899 at 10 a.m., the Union Pacific Express has left Folsom, New Mexico, with 47 passengers on board. After a few minutes, gunfire and hurrying footsteps on the roof can be heard. Heavily armed bandits have come to rob honest citizens of their wallets and jewels. Will they succeed in stealing the suitcase holding the Nice Valley Coal Company's weekly pay, despite it having been placed under the supervision of Marshal Samuel Ford? Will these bandits hinder one another more than the Marshal since only the richest one of them can come out on top?&#10;&#10;In Colt Express, you play a bandit robbing a train at the same time as other bandits, and your goal is to become the richest outlaw of the Old West. The game consists of five rounds, and each round has two phases:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Phase 1: Schemin' Each player plays 2-5 action cards on a common pile, with the cards being face up or face down depending on the type of the round. Instead of playing a card, a player can draw three cards from her deck.&#10;    Phase 2: Stealin' The action cards are carried out in the order they were played, with a player's best laid plans possibly not panning out due to mistakes and oversights!&#10;&#10;&#10;The game takes place in a 3D train in which the bandits can move from one car to another, run on the roof, punch the other bandits, shoot them, rob the passengers, or draw the Marshal out of position. The train has as many cars as the number of players, and each car is seeded with gems, bags of loot or suitcases at the start of play.&#10;&#10;Each player starts a round with six cards in hand, with each card showing one of these actions. At the start of a round, a round card is revealed, showing how many cards will be played; whether they'll be played face up or face down, or individually or in pairs; and what action will occur at the end of the round (e.g., all bandits on top of the train move to the engine). You can pick up loot, gems or suitcases only by playing a &quot;steal&quot; card when you're in a train car that holds one of these items &mdash; but since everyone is planning to get these goods, you'll need to move, punch and shoot to get others out of your way. You can punch someone only in the same car as you, and when you do, the other bandit drops one of the goods he's collected and is knocked into an adjacent car.&#10;&#10;Each player's character has a special power, such as starting the round with an extra card, playing your first card face down, or pocketing a bag of loot when you punch someone instead of letting it hit the ground.&#10;&#10;You can shoot someone in an adjacent car or (if you're running on top of the train) anyone in sight, and when you do, you give that player one of your six bullet cards; that card gets shuffled in the opponent's deck, possibly giving her a dead card in hand on a future turn and forcing her to draw instead of playing something. If the Marshal ends up in the same car as you, likely due to other bandits luring him through the train, he'll be happy to give you a bullet, too.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, whoever fired the most bullets receives a $1,000 braggart bonus, and whoever bagged the richest haul wins!&#10;&#10;	\N	2	6	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/2HKX0QANk_DY7CIVK5O5fQ__original/img/okv8rhQupsrXsEJsovQ_BJV5hKA=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2869710.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/2HKX0QANk_DY7CIVK5O5fQ__thumb/img/zcjkqn_HYDIIyVAZaAxJIkurQRg=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2869710.jpg

683	205398	Citadels	In Citadels, players take on new roles each round to represent characters they hire in order to help them acquire gold and erect buildings. The game ends at the close of a round in which a player erects their eighth building. Players then tally their points, and the player with the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;Players start the game with a number of building cards in their hand; buildings come in five colors, with the purple buildings typically having a special ability and the other colored buildings providing a benefit when you play particular characters. At the start of each round, the player who was king the previous round discards one of the eight character cards at random, chooses one, then passes the cards to the next player, etc. until each player has secretly chosen a character. Each character has a special ability, and the usefulness of any character depends upon your situation, and that of your opponents. The characters then carry out their actions in numerical order: the assassin eliminating another character for the round, the thief stealing all gold from another character, the wizard swapping building cards with another player, the warlord optionally destroys a building in play, and so on.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player earns two or more gold (or draws two building cards then discards one), then optionally constructs one building (or up to three if playing the architect this round). Buildings cost gold equal to the number of symbols on them, and each building is worth a certain number of points. In addition to points from buildings, at the end of the game a player scores bonus points for having eight buildings or buildings of all five colors.&#10;&#10;The 2016 edition of Citadels includes twenty-seven characters &mdash; eight from the original Citadels, ten from the Dark City expansion, and nine new ones &mdash; along with thirty unique building districts, and the rulebook includes six preset lists of characters and districts beyond the starter list, each crafted to encourage a different style and intensity of gameplay.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	8	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/sHd0jkZZLDgixHjAXtn7kA__original/img/9n76iqzSN06hlbX4DuuPD6fSkHQ=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3119514.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/sHd0jkZZLDgixHjAXtn7kA__thumb/img/HB0Z5D7uwBjf1lCCPjMck-5VP9A=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3119514.jpg

685	25417	BattleLore	This game is based upon Richard Borg's Command and Colors system.

686	337627	Voidfall	For centuries, the Novarchs, descendants of the royal House of Novarchon, have ruled with an iron fist over the feudalistic galactic empire of humankind, the Domineum. During this time, they brought stunning technological innovation and scientific advancements to their domain. This accelerated progression helped the Domineum reach &mdash; and eventually inhabit &mdash; even the farthest segments of the known galaxy, where new Houses emerged to govern the outer sectors of the empire. As the House of Novarchon grew in power, so grew the religious cult that surrounded them, proclaiming grim prophecies about an ancient cosmic being from another dimension: the Voidborn.&#10;&#10;Many thought it to be only a myth, but in truth, it was the Voidborn's dark influence that granted the Novarchs the sheer knowledge to achieve rapid expansion for the empire. While the cult of the Novarchs envisaged eternal life through the otherworldly entity, the Voidborn's only intention was satiating its eternal hunger. And so, when the Domineum had achieved a vastness fitting the Voidborn's craving, interdimensional rifts opened at the heart of the Domineum to unleash cosmic corruption. As the House of Novarchon and its followers welcomed the Voidborn and sought their false salvation, the entity infected and spread and seized control over the inner worlds. Now, it is time for the remaining Great Houses to purge the galactic corruption, prevent the Voidborn from fully manifesting in our dimension, and to ultimately overcome the chaos as the new rulers of the Domineum.&#10;&#10;Voidfall is a space 4X game that brings the genre to Euro enthusiasts' tables. It combines the tension, player interaction, and deep empire customization of the 4X genre with the resource management, tight decisions, and minimum-luck gameplay of an economic Euro. Win by pushing back the Voidborn in the solo/coop mode, or by overcoming your rivals' influence in restoring the Domineum in the competitive mode &mdash; both using the same rule set and game system. Variability is ensured not only by multiple playable houses with their own strengths and weaknesses, but also by many different map set-ups for all game modes.&#10;&#10;As the leader of a defiant Great House, you play through three cycles, each with a game-altering galactic event, a new scoring condition, and a set number of focus cards that can be played. Focus card decisions and sequencing is the centerpiece of the gameplay. By selecting two of their three impactful actions as you play them, you develop and improve techs; advance on your three house-specific civilization tracks; manage your sectors' infrastructure, population, and production; and conquer new sectors with up to five different types of space fleets. Space battles are fought either against the Voidborn's infected forces (which are present as neutral opponents even in the competitive mode) or against other players. Instead of relying on the luck of a die roll, battles in Voidfall are fully deterministic and reward careful preparation and outsmarting your opponents.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;	\N	1	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/hItZjdDTNuaCZ7fEztwcUQ__original/img/gIhusTrYRr_2JQGEv0zuSgLtuUo=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic6153324.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/hItZjdDTNuaCZ7fEztwcUQ__thumb/img/Ov6eWR87PZ2O1XYQtXMO6KvfzOg=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6153324.jpg

They can fly and sail between the six major population centers of the world, treat disease in their current region, collect samples for further study, and exchange knowledge to help them in their goal of discovering cures. Each player takes on a different role that has its own unique set of dice and abilities &mdash; and players must take advantage of their specializations if they are to have any hope of winning the game. The Dispatcher, for example, can spend dice to fly others around the board, while the Medic is particularly adept at treating disease. Players can roll their dice as often as they like, but the more times they re-roll for the perfect turn, the more likely the next epidemic will occur.&#10;&#10;At the end of each turn, new &quot;infection dice&quot; are rolled to determine the type and location of newly infected populations. If any region on the board is infected with more than three dice of a given color, an outbreak occurs, spreading disease into an adjacent region. If too many outbreaks take place, too many people get infected, or the rate of infection gets too high, all the players lose. If, however, the players can discover the cures to the four diseases, they all win and humanity is saved!&#10;&#10;Part of the Pandemic series.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	5	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/gCeKvj1ULixFOJ7uFawkcg__original/img/XeJ_F2OgSwwvTdEMsUiCAaatMb8=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2225998.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/gCeKvj1ULixFOJ7uFawkcg__thumb/img/xD_r6E6ZwYKXH-rtVPhGZoVleC4=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2225998.jpg
688	247367	Air, Land, & Sea	In Air, Land, &amp; Sea, two players participate in a series of Battles, with the objective to control two of the three Theaters of war after both players have played all of their Battle cards, or convince your opponent to withdraw!&#10;&#10;As Supreme Commander of your country's military forces, you must carefully deploy your forces across three possible theaters of war: Air, Land, and Sea. The order you play your Battle cards is critical, and so is how you play them. All cards can either be played face-up or face-down. Playing a card face-up triggers its Tactical Ability, but the card must be played in its corresponding theater. Face-down cards are wild and can be played to any theater, but only have a strength of 2 and do not grant Tactical Abilities.&#10;&#10;At the start of each battle, you will be dealt a hand of six cards. You will not draw additional cards during the Battle, so you must formulate your strategy based on only these cards. Players take turns playing Battle cards one at a time, until all cards have been played, or one player decides to withdraw.&#10;&#10;You do not have to continue a Battle to the very end. Sometimes, it may be best to withdraw in order to deny your opponent complete victory! In Air, Land, &amp; Sea, a strategic withdraw may lose you the battle to ultimately win the war!  Victory points are awarded at the end of each Battle based on the results, and the first player to 12 victory points wins the war!&#10;&#10;	\N	2	2	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/3wpYeNwO7k_yjpIN7IQwaw__original/img/_qQC98hufgmPn_fwMrP4I0sYKO8=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4387681.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/3wpYeNwO7k_yjpIN7IQwaw__thumb/img/kfzWQvTxwcVx_ljICqhu5Coq53Q=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4387681.jpg
689	331106	The Witcher: Old World	In The Witcher: Old World, you become a witcher &mdash; a professional monster slayer &mdash; and immerse yourself in the legendary universe of The Witcher franchise.&#10;&#10;Set years before the saga of Geralt of Rivia, The Witcher: Old World explores a time when monsters roamed the Continent in greater numbers, creating a constant peril that required the attention of expertly trained monster slayers, known as witchers. Five competing schools trained their adepts through brutal regimes, and once fully prepared, these now-recognized witchers set off to explore the land, seeking trouble and adventures and helping others for coin.&#10;&#10;In this competitive adventure board game, 2-5 players travel across a vast map, embarking on masterfully penned quests, encountering and making ambiguous moral choices, fighting monsters &mdash; and sometimes brawling with other witchers to defend their school's honor!&#10;&#10;The game lets players construct their own unique decks of cards by choosing from a wide range of abilities: attacks, dodges, and witcher combat magic &mdash; known as &quot;signs&quot;. Through card synergy, players aim to achieve powerful combos as they utilize their witcher school's hallmark abilities to their full potential. Quests, battles, and even dice poker allow each player to earn money, obtain new items, and train their skills.&#10;&#10;The first player to acquire 4-6 trophies, with the number being set at the start of play, wins the game instantly. You can obtain trophies by killing monsters, instigating and winning chaotic tavern brawls against another witcher, training attributes to their highest level, and resolving certain quests throughout their adventure.&#10;&#10;The game will include a Solo Mode that will allow for a solitaire adventure on the Continent.&#10;&#10;	\N	1	5	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/tQVVSXcmYLvAoI28cp-2Tg__original/img/0JwC_ndrsYO3hkawTSLpdf9huKc=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5974859.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/tQVVSXcmYLvAoI28cp-2Tg__thumb/img/ahKWaUSws5zja4feB4VexkNV3Mc=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5974859.jpg
690	175095	Dawn of the Zeds (Third Edition)	The postcards in every local drug store read, &quot;Welcome to Fabulous Farmingdale!&quot;, an ad campaign that was the brainchild of Mayor Hernandez (who coincidentally employed his wife's public relations firm to market their community). But right now, things are far from fabulous in Farmingdale and, for once, everyone isn't blaming the Mayor. Some kind of virus or poison is turning ordinary people into vicious, zombie-like killers. It is not clear how the disease spreads (though it seems that physical contact is certainly one way), but it is obvious what the illness does to its victims.&#10;&#10;These undead, nicknamed &quot;Zeds&quot; from the local newscasts as the acronym for &quot;Zombie Epidemic Disease,&quot; are now converging on your corner of the world around Farmingdale. As best you can tell, you have been left to your own devices to stop them while the National Guard organizes a relief column, but that could take days, perhaps weeks, for them to fight their way to you and until then, what can you do?&#10;&#10;With little choice between survival and a gruesome (un)death, you realize that you must coordinate the defense of the town of Farmingdale and its surrounding villages. You must lead the good citizens and emerging heroes of these communities to halt the Zeds' advances by (re)killing them, attempt to coordinate the discovery of a cure to this vile scourge, and preserve as much of the area and as many of its inhabitants as possible. There's no time to lose...&#10;&#10;	\N	1	5	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/WnREnwi-pR72tqDa9-1zBQ__original/img/o31sWdbMtQFA0cZQtpx1pB7if-E=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4929411.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/WnREnwi-pR72tqDa9-1zBQ__thumb/img/-bedWb_t582j4ghHjJpE7QCE0IU=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4929411.jpg
691	12942	No Thanks!	No Thanks! is a card game designed to be as simple as it is engaging.&#10;&#10;The rules are simple.  Each turn, players have two options:&#10;&#10;    play one of their chips to avoid picking up the current face-up card&#10;    pick up the face-up card (along with any chips that have already been played on that card) and turn over the next card&#10;&#10;&#10;However, the choices aren't so easy as players compete to have the lowest score at the end of the game.  The deck of cards is numbered from 3 to 35, with each card counting for a number of points equal to its face value.  Runs of two or more cards only count as the lowest value in the run - but nine cards are removed from the deck before starting, so be careful looking for connectors.  Each chip is worth -1 point, but they can be even more valuable by allowing you to avoid drawing that unwanted card.&#10;&#10;The first versions of the game supported up to five players, but the German 2011 edition supports up to seven (simply by increasing the number of chips).&#10;&#10;This game was originally published in Germany in 2004 by Amigo as Geschenkt ...ist noch zu teuer!, meaning Even given as a gift, it is still too expensive!.  Amigo's 2006 international edition, titled No Merci! (a delightful multi-lingual pun), had rules in several languages, including English. The game has subsequently been released in other countries under an assortment of names.&#10;&#10;	\N	3	7	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/2DyxMVASynw87LRULZuyqA__original/img/IHLuH9f5dB6jJn74cdVdMixAUKg=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4657706.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/2DyxMVASynw87LRULZuyqA__thumb/img/yIUSMoN8O5FeDZjXa4vreKj5Ogw=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4657706.jpg
692	197376	Charterstone	The prosperous Kingdom of Greengully, ruled for centuries by the Forever King, has issued a decree to its citizens to colonize the vast lands beyond its borders. In an effort to start a new village, the Forever King has selected six citizens for the task, each of whom has a unique set of skills they use to build their charter.&#10;&#10;In Charterstone, a competitive legacy game, you construct buildings and populate a shared village. Building stickers are permanently added to the game board and become action spaces for any player to use. Thus, you start off with simple choices and few workers, but soon you have a bustling village with dozens of possible actions.&#10;&#10;Your journey through Charterstone's many secrets will last twelve games, but it doesn&rsquo;t end there. Your completed village will be a one-of-a-kind worker-placement game with plenty of variability.&#10;&#10;Charterstone released in the US/Canada on December 12, 2017 (the rest of the world received it slightly earlier).&#10;&#10;	\N	1	6	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/yKjDaHQiv28iqtzDxfQOZQ__original/img/TBiQWuVmimy-SBNrsBheCAspf78=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3322613.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/yKjDaHQiv28iqtzDxfQOZQ__thumb/img/y0YNU2Bf4W6rNQUXVhhe4tWnU8E=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3322613.jpg
693	105134	Risk Legacy	This description is spoiler free, containing nothing outside the initial rulebook for the game. Details on why this is important in the description.&#10;&#10;Risk Legacy represents what is if not a new, at least a rare concept to boardgaming: campaigning. At its core, the game, particularly at first, plays much like regular Risk with a few changes. Players control countries or regions on a map of the world, and through simple combat (with players rolling dice to determine who loses units in each battle) they try to eliminate all opponents from the game board or control a certain number of &quot;red stars&quot;, otherwise known as victory points (VPs).&#10;&#10;What's different is that Risk Legacy' changes over time based on the outcome of each game and the various choices made by players. In each game, players choose one of five factions; each faction has uniquely shaped pieces, and more importantly, different rules. At the start of the first game, each of these factions gains the ability to break one minor rule, such as the ability to move troops at any time during your turn, as opposed to only at the end.&#10;&#10;What makes this game unique is that when powers are chosen, players must choose one of their faction's two powers, affix that power's sticker to their faction card, then destroy the card that has the other rule on it &ndash; and by destroy, the rules mean what they say: &quot;If a card is DESTROYED, it is removed from the game permanently. Rip it up. Throw it in the trash.&quot; This key concept permeates through the game. Some things you do in a game will affect it temporarily, while others will affect it permanently. These changes may include boosting the resources of a country (for recruiting troops in lieu of the older &quot;match three symbols&quot; style of recruiting), adding bonuses or penalties to defending die rolls to countries, or adding permanent continent troop bonuses that may affect all players.&#10;&#10;The rule book itself is also designed to change as the game continues, with blocks of blank space on the pages to allow for rules additions or changes. Entire sections of rules will not take effect until later in the game. The game box contains different sealed packages and compartments, each with a written condition for opening. The rule book indicates that these contain the rule additions, additional faction powers, and other things that should not be discussed here for spoiler protection.&#10;&#10;The winner of each of the first 15 games receives a &quot;major bonus,&quot; such as founding a major city (which only he will be allowed to start on in future games), deleting a permanent modifier from the board, destroying a country card (preventing it from providing any resources towards purchasing troops in future games), changing a continent troop bonus, or naming a continent, which gives that player a troop bonus in future games. Players who did not win but were not eliminated are allowed to make minor changes to the world, such as founding a minor city or adding resources to a country.&#10;&#10;It should be noted that although cards are ripped up over the course of the game, there are so many cards added via the sealed packages, that the game does not suffer. Nor is this a &quot;disposable&quot; game, merely a customized one. The game can continue to change beyond the 15 game campaign, and even when it finally does stop changing, you still have a copy of Risk that is completely unique.&#10;&#10;Initial games take approximately 30-90 minutes to play, which includes a brief rules explanation and setup.&#10;&#10;	\N	3	5	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/LxKu8_oihOQftb2npGvWMw__original/img/RYE_1BgSltTvgk5ATE84jPjCDbM=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1196938.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/LxKu8_oihOQftb2npGvWMw__thumb/img/-g2SLefjovkUxW7H6sFOmAMjfA4=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1196938.jpg
694	478	Citadels	In Citadels, players take on new roles each round to represent characters they hire in order to help them acquire gold and erect buildings. The game ends at the close of a round in which a player erects his/her eighth building. Players then tally their points, and the player with the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;Players start with a number of building cards in their hand; buildings come in five colors, with the purple buildings typically having a special ability and the other colored buildings providing a benefit when you play particular characters. At the start of each round, the player who was king the previous round discards one of the eight character cards at random, chooses one, then passes the cards to the next player, etc. until each player has secretly chosen a character. Each character has a special ability, and the usefulness of any character depends upon your situation, and that of your opponents. The characters then carry out their actions in numerical order: the assassin eliminating another character for the round, the thief stealing all gold from another character, the wizard swapping building cards with another player, the warlord optionally destroys a building in play, and so on.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player earns two or more gold (or draws two building cards then discards one), then optionally constructs one building (or up to three if playing the architect this round). Buildings cost gold equal to the number of symbols on them, and each building is worth a certain number of points. In addition to points from buildings, at the end of the game a player scores bonus points for having eight buildings or buildings of all five colors.&#10;&#10;The expansion Citadels: The Dark City was initially released as a separate item, but the second edition of the game from Hans im Gl&uuml;ck (packaged in a tin box) and the third edition from Fantasy Flight Games included this expansion and can be recognized by its rectangular box (not square). With Dark City, Citadels supports a maximum of eight players.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	8	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/42iW4E-vOumFXRQAiSf-GA__original/img/ochY5pK4sq4vtzkka0OPRwsGLOE=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3239104.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/42iW4E-vOumFXRQAiSf-GA__thumb/img/lxwVwqIO1RkDyyykSDFnpmwbgyI=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3239104.jpg

696	162082	Deus	In Deus, players work to develop their own civilizations in a shared environment. Each player starts the game with five building cards, and on a turn a player either uses one of these cards to construct a building or discard one or more cards to make an offering to a god. Cards come in six colors: red for military, green for resource production, blue for trade, brown for scoring, purple for temples, and yellow for a variety of effects.&#10;&#10;When you construct a building, you build it in the appropriate location on the modular game board &mdash; which is sized based on the number of players with the hexagonal tiles composed of seven landscape &quot;circles&quot; &mdash; then you place the card in your personal tableau in the appropriate stack of colored cards and activate the power of all of those cards already in your tableau, starting with the card at the bottom of the stack.&#10;&#10;When you make an offering, you discard cards, then receive the help of a god associated with one of the cards that you discarded, with the number of cards determining the strength of the associated action. You then refill your hand to five cards.&#10;&#10;The game ends either when all the barbarian villages on the game board have been surrounded and attacked or when all the temples have been constructed. Whoever has the most points wins.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/NOz3xJ-N5ptlq3rP9m5Wug__original/img/gtzP1OE-ifZdnSHoX1pmVwpF0mY=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic2219643.png	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/NOz3xJ-N5ptlq3rP9m5Wug__thumb/img/nQQSc-beglCc9XQwvptEwgm07wU=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2219643.png
697	157969	Sheriff of Nottingham	Prince John is coming to Nottingham! Players, in the role of merchants, see this as an opportunity to make quick profits by selling goods in the bustling city during the Prince's visit. However, players must first get their goods through the city gate, which is under the watch of the Sheriff of Nottingham. Should you play it safe with legal goods and make a profit, or risk it all by sneaking in illicit goods? Be mindful, though, as the Sheriff always has his eyes out for liars and tricksters and if he catches one, he very well may confiscate those goods for himself!&#10;&#10;In Sheriff of Nottingham, players will not only be able to experience Nottingham as a merchant of the city, but each turn one player will step into the shoes of the Sheriff himself. Players declare goods they wish to bring into the city, goods that are secretly stored in their burlap sack. The Sheriff must then determine who gets into the city with their goods, who gets inspected, and who may have their goods confiscated!&#10;&#10;Do you have what it takes to be seen as an honest merchant? Will you make a deal with the Sheriff to let you in? Or will you persuade the Sheriff to target another player while you quietly slip by the gate?

700	216600	Fantastic Factories	It's a manufacturing arms race! Compete against other players as you try to build the most efficient set of factories in the shortest time. You must carefully manage your blueprints, train your workers, and manufacture as many goods as possible in order to achieve industrial dominance!&#10;&#10;In Fantastic Factories, you race to manufacture the most goods or build the most prestigious buildings. There are elements of dice rolling, worker placement, engine building, resource management, tableau building, simultaneous play, and some card drafting. Each round is split into two phases, the market phase and the work phase.&#10;&#10;During the market phase, you choose to either acquire a new blueprint for free or pay to hire a contractor. Blueprints are used to construct new factories during the work phase. Contractors can be used to reinforce your strategy by providing resources or allowing you to roll additional dice. You need to be mindful of what cards are available in the marketplace and the strategies your opponents may be pursuing.&#10;&#10;During the work phase, all players simultaneously roll their dice and use their dice as workers to run factories. Factories start as blueprints and need to be constructed. Once constructed, each factory can be used once each turn. Worker placement can happen in any order and figuring out the correct sequence can enable a powerful chain of actions. Additionally, you can build training facilities that allow you to manipulate the dice values of your workers. Each work phase is like solving a unique worker placement puzzle in order to optimize your output of resources and goods.&#10;&#10;Once any player has manufactured 12 goods or constructed 10 buildings, the game end is triggered and one additional and final round is played. The player with the most points wins (combination of building prestige and manufactured goods). With over 30 unique blueprints and countless synergies across buildings, each game is unique. Fantastic Factories offers a lot of replay value and satisfaction as players discover new factory engines with each game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;A large collection of solo puzzles have also been created for Fantastic Factories along with official tools to create more.

702	20437	Lords of Vegas	You and your opponents represent powerful developers in a burgeoning Nevada city. You will earn money and prestige by building the biggest and most profitable casinos on &quot;The Strip,&quot; the town's backbone of dust and sin. You start with nothing but parking lots and dreams, but from there you build, sprawl, reorganize and gamble your way to victory. Score the most points investing in the most profitable development companies and putting the best bosses in control of the richest casinos. Put your dollars on the line . . . it's time to roll!&#10;&#10;The game board is broken into 6 different areas, each consisting of a number of empty 'lots'. Players build lots by paying money and placing a die of the value matching the one shown on the lot's space onto the lot, along with a casino tile of one of 7 colors. Adjoining lots of the same color are considered a single casino. The casino's boss is the player whose die value is higher than any other in the casino. On each players turn, players turn over a new card representing a new lot they get. The card also is one of the casino colors. Any built casinos of the matching color will score both money and points. Money is earned for each lot in the casino, where each lot may be owned by a different player.

703	146791	Shadows of Brimstone: City of the Ancients	Shadows of Brimstone: City of the Ancients is a fast-paced, fully cooperative, dungeon-crawl board game set in the Old West, with a heavy dose of unspeakable horror! Players create characters, taking on the role of a classic Western Hero Archetype, such as the Law Man, Gunslinger, or Saloon Girl. Forming an adventuring posse, the Heroes venture down into the dark mines, overrun with all manner of ancient demons and foul creatures from another world. With tactical gameplay, lots of dice, and a robust card-driven exploration system, no two games are ever the same as the heroes explore the mines finding new enemies to fight, new loot to collect, and new dangers to overcome. Players can even find portals to other worlds, stepping through to continue their adventures on the other side!&#10;&#10;An exciting campaign system allows the players to visit local frontier towns between adventures, spending their hard-earned loot and building their characters from game to game! As players find fantastic gear and artifacts to equip their heroes, they also gain experience from their adventures. This experience is used to level up, guiding the hero's path through an expansive, class-specific upgrade tree of new skills and abilities, allowing each player to develop their hero to fit their own play style.&#10;&#10;In City of the Ancients, players will encounter portals to the otherworld on the Plains of Targa, finding an ancient frozen city whose living inhabitants are nowhere to be found.  Instead, great mechanical keepers wander the city going about their duties - until interrupted by the arrival of the players' characters!&#10;&#10;So load up yer' six shooter, throw on yer' hat and poncho, and gather the posse as the darkness is coming, and all hell's about to break loose...in the Shadows of Brimstone!&#10;&#10;Can be used together with Shadows of Brimstone: Swamps of Death to raise the maximum players to 6.&#10;&#10;	\N	1	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ZnkF6PeVDEOJvc2EHT7ZHw__original/img/NUw0DtFPhK-whyBaXVLg_c1oK1o=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2037825.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ZnkF6PeVDEOJvc2EHT7ZHw__thumb/img/O6DtRhRClEvh2JMyHUa401D4Rdg=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2037825.jpg
704	15062	Shadows over Camelot	Shadows over Camelot is a cooperative/semi-cooperative hand-management and deduction-based board game for 3&ndash;7 players.&#10;&#10;Each player represents a knight of the Round Table and they must collaborate to overcome a number of quests, ranging from defeating the Black Knight to the search for the Holy Grail. Completed quests place white swords on the Round Table; failed quests add black swords and/or siege engines around Camelot. The knights are trying to build a majority of white swords on the Table before Camelot falls.&#10;&#10;On each knight's turn, the knight takes a &quot;heroic action&quot;, such as moving to a new quest, building his hand, or playing cards to advance the forces of good. However, he must also choose one of three evil actions, each of which will bring Camelot closer to defeat.&#10;&#10;Moreover, one of the knights may be a traitor, pretending to be a loyal member of the party but secretly hindering his fellow knights in subtle ways, biding his time, waiting to strike at the worst possible moment...&#10;&#10;But enough words... don your cloak, climb astride your warhorse, and gallop into the Shadows to join us in Camelot!&#10;&#10;	\N	3	7	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/JYqwG_v1B3RhpB7NcmeDOA__original/img/_eAaG7PMaTcj1DpHbmUaOBTisoY=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic70547.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/JYqwG_v1B3RhpB7NcmeDOA__thumb/img/QOG1zO0uvqxGTDF9V_OewVPMvNE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic70547.jpg
705	98778	Hanabi	Hanabi&mdash;named for the Japanese word for &quot;fireworks&quot;&mdash;is a cooperative game in which players try to create the perfect fireworks show by placing the cards on the table in the right order. (In Japanese, hanabi is written as &#232;&#138;&#177;&#231;&#129;&#171;; these are the ideograms flower and fire, respectively.)&#10;&#10;The card deck consists of five different colors of cards, numbered 1&ndash;5 in each color. For each color, the players try to place a row in the correct order from 1&ndash;5. Sounds easy, right? Well, not quite, as in this game you hold your cards so that they're visible only to other players. To assist other players in playing a card, you must give them hints regarding the numbers or the colors of their cards. Players must act as a team to avoid errors and to finish the fireworks display before they run out of cards.&#10;&#10;An extra suit of cards, rainbow colored, is also provided for advanced or variant play.&#10;&#10;Hanabi was originally published as part of Hanabi & Ikebana.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	5	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/JDVksMwfcqoem1k_xtZrOA__original/img/5vNHZiTEhK4aRDuGXv5KImp9cmQ=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2007286.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/JDVksMwfcqoem1k_xtZrOA__thumb/img/amCeCcEKhYGbVtDvpvIMnu3qTg0=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2007286.jpg
706	17226	Descent: Journeys in the Dark	Descent: Journeys in the Dark is a &quot;one vs. many&quot; game in which up to four players will choose characters with a wide assortment of skills and innate abilities to be the heroes who will explore dungeons in search of treasure and adventure, while one player will take on the role of the Overlord and will control the dungeon's many traps, puzzles, and monsters.&#10;&#10;The heroes' goal will be to cooperatively conquer the dungeon, seize its many treasures, and achieve other objectives as set by the scenario. If the heroes cooperate and achieve their goals, they will all win. The Overlord's objective is simply to use all the means at their disposal - from deadly traps to ferocious monsters - to kill the heroes. Each hero has a certain Conquest Point value to the party and if too many Conquest Points are lost through hero death, the party loses and the Overlord wins.&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;    Descent: Journeys in the Dark (Second Edition) (2012)&#10;&#10;&#10;	\N	2	5	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/915Abv-1k4_f_-__SkXybg__original/img/LEJxK0iifCkmJcX0uytGCk72v8M=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic249300.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/915Abv-1k4_f_-__SkXybg__thumb/img/gn1-n9C_vhQufKI9aosUfP6_WwA=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic249300.jpg
707	232414	Oceans	Three years in the making, Oceans is a stand-alone game in the award-winning Evolution series.  With over 120 works of art, 40 scenarios cards, and more than 100 unique trait cards, Oceans is the most ambitious project North Star Games has ever tackled.&#10;&#10;Theme&#10;Oceans depicts the boundaries between the known world near the ocean&rsquo;s surface, and the mysteries lurking in Earth&rsquo;s deepest unexplored region. Enter a vast, underwater cosmos: a mysterious interconnected world of sharp teeth, glowing eyes, and black ink, where your survival depends on your ability to adapt to the unknown.&#10;&#10;The foundation of the oceanic food chain are billions of one-celled organisms called phytoplankton that capture the sun's energy through photosynthesis. Every other species in the ocean is a predator, each bigger than the next, all the way up to the dreaded Apex Predator. And even bigger than Apex Predators are enormous Whales that gently swim through the ocean scooping up everything in their path. This ecosystem mimics the known world near the surface.&#10;&#10;But there is more if you are willing to dive deeper...&#10;&#10;Oceans also includes a deck of 100 unique power cards called The Deep that represents the unknown. These powerful cards break the seams of the reality you've come to accept, ranging from astonishing things found in the ocean, to the fantastical Kraken or Leviathan.&#10;&#10;Gameplay&#10;Oceans is an interactive engine builder, where players evolve their species in a continually changing ecosystem. Players must adapt their interconnected ecosystem to survive against the inevitable march of time (Aging), as well as a multitude of predators looking for food.&#10;&#10;During the first half of the game, players use traits from a deck of Surface cards to modify their species.  With only 12 Surface traits, it&rsquo;s easy to wade into your first game without being overwhelmed by new cards. These traits were chosen for their rich thematic interconnections, providing synergistic card play that mimics an oceanic ecosystem.  The Surface traits bring stability to the game environment.&#10;&#10;During the second half of the game, players can use power cards from The Deep to disrupt the stability. With over 100 unique traits in The Deep, players will slowly discover game-altering traits over the course of many games.  These traits were designed to evoke wonder and disbelief - to spark your imagination as you consider the fantastic synergies that are possible in Oceans.&#10;&#10;Additionally, there are 2 randomly chosen scenario cards that activate and deactivate at various points during the game. The scenario cards impact the basic tenets of gameplay, encouraging people to vary their play style and strategy each game.&#10;&#10;The Evolution Series&#10;Oceans is a stand-alone game in the Evolution series, but it's a vast departure from other games in the series. The turn structure has been simplified, the game play is much more forgiving, and the web of interconnections has increased dramatically. Whereas Evolution has the feeling of a traditional back-and-forth battle game like Magic: The Gathering,  Oceans has the feel of an interactive engine builder where everything is interconnected, and where your engine must continually adapt to a changing environment.&#10;&#10;Join the Oceans Discord community for rule questions, strategy discussions, and to get involved in future playtesting.&#10;&#10;https://discord.gg/GMaDycjKBV&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/1J7_qmdohyypZNyvu8B45A__original/img/N4cHTwdthImTVqNrJUN9jQDskRc=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4382323.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/1J7_qmdohyypZNyvu8B45A__thumb/img/ASgVEQj-H2lzopAgm-_QgqEBVvI=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4382323.jpg

709	239942	Black Rose Wars	Black Rose Wars is a competitive fantasy game of deck-building, strategy, and combat set in the hectic universe of Nova Aetas in Italy. Each player is one of powerful mages of the Black Rose Order who aspires to become the new Supreme Magister in order to acquire the mighty power of the Black Rose Artifact and the Forgotten Magic. Mages must fight, fulfill Black Rose desires, and gain strength with their spells until their power reaches the containment threshold of the prison where they are exiled, finally freeing themselves. Each mage has at their disposal six schools of magic, each one with its own strategy to annihilate their opponents and increase their power.&#10;&#10;At the start of the battle, mages start with a grimoire of six cards; as mages study more spells during play, their grimoire will increase. Every spell in Black Rose Wars has two different effects, increasing a player's adaptability during a fight.&#10;&#10;Mages fight each other in a modular arena of hexagons called &quot;rooms&quot;. They summon powerful creatures, cast destructive spells, or devise dark deceptions with their enchantments. The game system is divided into different phases. Each turn, after choosing new spells from the six schools of magic, players plan their strategy in advance, placing cards face down. Later, they reveal the played cards to kill each other, solve missions, summon creatures, or destroy the prison rooms, one against each other and against the Black Rose (the playing system).  &#10;After being killed, mages are reborn immediately, allowing them to re-enter the fight without delay &mdash; although their death still fed energy to those mages who caused it.&#10;The mage with the most power at the end of the battle will be crowned Supreme Magister of the Order by the Black Rose itself.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Nam2TVpVSvHIuAsbocL9cw__original/img/mwtQpefJ_U7pjNguijLo7o7bIpc=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic6892325.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Nam2TVpVSvHIuAsbocL9cw__thumb/img/hyQNAZKGjQ1Hc2-WzwAAZICBMA4=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6892325.jpg
710	83330	Mansions of Madness	Description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;Horrific monsters and spectral presences lurk in manors, crypts, schools, monasteries, and derelict buildings near Arkham, Massachusetts. Some spin dark conspiracies while others wait for hapless victims to devour or drive insane. It&rsquo;s up to a handful of brave investigators to explore these cursed places and uncover the truth about the living nightmares within.&#10;&#10;Designed by Corey Konieczka, Mansions of Madness is a macabre game of horror, insanity, and mystery for two to five players. Each game takes place within a pre-designed story that provides players with a unique map and several combinations of plot threads. These threads affect the monsters that investigators may encounter, the clues they need to find, and which climactic story ending they will ultimately experience. One player takes on the role of the keeper, controlling the monsters and other malicious powers within the story. The other players take on the roles of investigators, searching for answers while struggling to survive with their minds intact.&#10;&#10;Do you dare enter the Mansions of Madness?&#10;&#10;	\N	2	5	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/JtjGOgkaIxnLUeoV56cWFQ__original/img/47Cef6w56t2Vomn6bO8aT5p1ZiI=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic814011.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/JtjGOgkaIxnLUeoV56cWFQ__thumb/img/eaj13E1FPWuVbXyBNBpewxXlVD0=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic814011.jpg
711	193042	Junk Art	In Junk Art, players are presented with junk from which they must create art. Thus the name.&#10;&#10;Junk Art contains more than ten game modes, along with more than sixty big colorful wooden or plastic components. In one version of the game, players pile all of the wooden or plastic parts in the center of the table, then are dealt a number of cards, with each card depicting one of these parts. On a turn, a player presents their left-hand neighbor with two cards from their hand. This neighbor takes one card in hand, then takes the part shown on the other card and places it on their base or on other parts that they've already placed. If something falls, it stays on the table and the player continues to build on whatever still stands. Once players have finished playing cards, whoever has the tallest work of art wins.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	6	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/5VDnpX_3ykgCjTJSmHdfCA__original/img/jb13nJHqbMmoK0P9gpjGaVu8v3U=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2884509.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/5VDnpX_3ykgCjTJSmHdfCA__thumb/img/LLHF9t1MxB0m-NBe_C9cxAyIslA=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2884509.jpg
712	350933	The Guild of Merchant Explorers	In The Guild of Merchant Explorers, each player starts with one city on their personal map board.&#10;&#10;Shuffle the deck of terrain cards, then reveal most of these cards one by one. Based on the terrain revealed, each player places on their board cubes that are connected to their starting city or other cubes. You want to complete areas on your board, cross the seas to new land, and establish new cities on the board. You can explore capsized ships for treasure &mdash; which gives you special placement capabilities &mdash; and create linked connections between locations to score bonus points. Common objectives can be completed by all players, with those who complete it first scoring more points.&#10;&#10;At the end of a round, all cubes are removed from each board, leaving only the cities behind, so if you don't establish new cities, you'll be stuck in the same places.&#10;&#10;The Guild of Merchant Explorers contains multiple copies of four different maps, and the game is designed so that you can play remotely with one or more copies.&#10;&#10;	\N	1	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/HZQAedsq10yAgotyNth4og__original/img/jTvjgU0WrhyTKWf0bDyMrhPqsdM=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic6670587.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/HZQAedsq10yAgotyNth4og__thumb/img/56IVwtzXk9WZz750cekqFYWw16g=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6670587.jpg
713	292375	The Great Wall	The Great Wall is a new asymmetric worker/soldier placement game with engine building themes and a twist in form of a constantly attacking AI (Mongolian Horde) that requires players to sometimes cooperate in order to defeat it. This is a new major board game from Awaken Realms.&#10;&#10;Players will control ancient clans in China trying to defend against invading Mongolian hordes and build a Great Wall. While every player will want to win (by earning VP = Honor) they also need to sometimes cooperate to defend against the hordes. Each clan will be asymmetric through its chosen Leader (resource production/starting resources/starting workers and units) and this asymmetry will increase as the game progresses (players will hire Advisors with unique skills, often creating unique engines).&#10;&#10;In The Great Wall, the players take the role of Generals defending the Wall against the Mongol Horde. The game is played over a series of turns called Years, each divided into 4 parts called Seasons.&#10;&#10;During Spring, new barbaric hordes invade the fields in front of the Great Wall and prepare to launch their assault. Summer is the time when generals prepare for the assault and mobilize their forces. During Fall, players take their turns, playing Command cards, resolving their effects and Activating Locations to gain various benefits. In Winter, the last layer of Defense is activated, then, the hordes try to assault the Walls.&#10;&#10;During the course of the game, players will create their own unique engines based on their clan strength as well as interact with other players during all phases of the game, trying to get the most Honor points, which can be gained in a lot of different ways.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, the player with the most Honor wins.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;	\N	1	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/3P1cMmZ47nf_L1zLO-pKlg__original/img/8mgbSvzu7-1WX4R8ZRseupThtLY=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5016682.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/3P1cMmZ47nf_L1zLO-pKlg__thumb/img/TEMZ4S46PDoaI3X2enaNKKLthPE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5016682.jpg
715	43570	Friday	Friday, the second game in the Friedemann Friese Series: Freitag-Project (Friedemann Friese), is based on the story of Robinson Crusoe and his loyal partner Friday (Freitag). You play as Friday, and when Robinson Crusoe crashes his ship on your island, your peaceful times are disturbed. You must help Robinson to survive the island and prepare him to defeat the pirates that are coming for the island.&#10;&#10;Friday is a solitaire deck-building game in which you optimize your deck of fight cards in order to defeat the hazards of the island. During a turn the player will attempt to defeat hazard cards by playing fight cards from their deck. If defeated, a hazard card will become a fight card and is added to the player's deck. If failed, the player will lose life points but also get the opportunity to remove unwanted cards from their fight deck. In the end, the player will use their optimized fight deck to defeat the two pirate ships coming for the island, allowing Robinson Crusoe to escape the island and allowing you to finally have your peace back!&#10;&#10;	\N	1	1	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/7bBUuYUIyKIBDh_UnNa_Fw__original/img/_tiZYJMEc26kgt7uNF6IM8A-8As=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1513328.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/7bBUuYUIyKIBDh_UnNa_Fw__thumb/img/Bjg_3ovfjRqjGtYEaEj6107UGWY=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1513328.jpg
716	290236	Canvas	In Canvas, you play as a painter competing in an art competition. Players will collect art cards, layering 3 of them together to create their own unique Painting. Each card contains a piece of artwork as well as a set of icons used during scoring. Icons will be revealed or hidden based on the way players choose to layer the cards making for an exciting puzzle. Paintings are scored based on a set of Scoring cards which will change each game. Once players have created and scored 3 paintings the game ends.&#10;&#10;On your turn you may take an Art card or make a painting. Art cards are selected from a row of cards in the center of play. Each of these cards has a cost associated with their position. After selecting an Art card you must pay its cost by placing an Inspiration token on each of the cards to its left. If you do not have enough Inspiration tokens, you may not select that card. Any tokens on the card you have selected are kept for future turns. The far left card costs no Inspiration tokens to take.&#10;&#10;If you have three or more Art cards you may choose to make a painting. Select 3 of your art cards, arrange them in any order and then score them by comparing the visible icons on your painting to the Scoring conditions.&#10;&#10;Once all players have made 3 paintings the game ends.&#10;&#10;The player with the most points wins!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;	\N	1	5	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/kXJLvPqcDF7Id5KRejhnuQ__original/img/jiORb05QSdRMi-eo1Vi_3wjUSWU=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic7125372.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/kXJLvPqcDF7Id5KRejhnuQ__thumb/img/5kQGDC3kYmvil7dU8uT-o0sZiEo=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7125372.jpg
717	11	Bohnanza	Bohnanza is the first in the Bohnanza family of games and has been published in several different editions, including a 2023 version with flowers.&#10;&#10;In the game, you plant, then harvest bean cards in order to earn coins. Each player starts with a hand of random bean cards, and each card has a number on it corresponding to the number of that type of beans in the deck. Unlike in most other card games, you can't rearrange the order of cards in hand, so you must use them in the order that you've picked them up from the deck &mdash; unless you can trade them to other players, which is the heart of the game.&#10;&#10;On a turn, you must plant the first one or two cards in your hand into the &quot;fields&quot; in front of you. Each field can hold only one type of bean, so if you must plant a type of bean that's not in one of your fields, then you must harvest a field to make room for the new arrival. This usually isn't good! Next, you reveal two cards from the deck, and you can then trade these cards as well as any card in your hand for cards from other players. You can even make future promises for cards received right now! After all the trading is complete &mdash; and all trades on a turn must involve the active player &mdash; then you end your turn by drawing cards from the deck and placing them at the back of your hand.&#10;&#10;When you harvest beans, you receive coins based on the number of bean cards in that field and the &quot;beanometer&quot; for that particular type of bean. Flip over 1-4 cards from that field to transform them into coins, then place the remainder of the cards in the discard pile. When the deck runs out, shuffle the discards, playing through the deck two more times. At the end of the game, everyone can harvest their fields, then whoever has earned the most coins wins.&#10;&#10;The original German edition supports 3-5 players. The English version from Rio Grande Games comes with the first edition of the first German expansion included in a slightly oversized box. One difference in the contents, however, is that bean #22's Weinbrandbohne (Brandy Bean) was replaced by the Wachsbohne, or Wax Bean. This edition includes rules for up to seven players, like the Erweiterungs-Set, but also adapts the two-player rules of Al Cabohne in order to allow two people to play Bohnanza.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	7	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/8SADtu_4zBH_UJrCo935Iw__original/img/RNuAr2CDbxE3XzeJVkxj4Df3eVM=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic6348964.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/8SADtu_4zBH_UJrCo935Iw__thumb/img/vwTEQOWA3Mw__ztkTMulOgJ82Pw=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6348964.jpg
718	206480	Imperial Struggle	In 1697 the Sun King, Louis XIV, emerged from a decade of war with his Continental ambitions still unsatisfied. Meanwhile, King William III of England sat easier on his new throne than he ever had before. With the Spanish succession crisis unresolved and looming, there were no illusions that the new century would be a quiet one. But neither France nor England could have anticipated the tumult of the years to come: a Second Hundred Years' War, during which these two tenacious adversaries would compete fiercely and proudly along every axis of human achievement. On battlefields from India to Canada to the Caribbean Sea their armies and fleets would clash; in the salons of Paris and the coffee-houses of London the modern world&rsquo;s politics and economics would be born; and finally a revolution would rock the foundations of society &ndash; a revolution that could have ended not in blood and terror but in a triumph of democracy and liberty that might have transformed the world beyond imagining.&#10;&#10;Imperial Struggle is a two-player game depicting the 18th-century rivalry between France and Britain. It begins in 1697, as the two realms wait warily for the King of Spain to name an heir, and ends in 1789, when a new order brought down the Bastille. The game is not merely about war: both France and Britain must build the foundations of colonial wealth, deal with the other nations of Europe, and compete for glory across the span of human endeavor.&#10;&#10;Imperial Struggle covers almost 100 years of history and four major wars. Yet it remains a low-complexity game, playable in a short evening. It aims to honor its spiritual ancestor, Twilight Struggle, by pushing further in the direction of simple rules and playable systems, while maintaining global scope and historical sweep in the scope of a single evening. In peace turns, players build their economic interests and alliances, and take advantage of historical events represented by Event cards. They must choose their investments wisely, but also with an eye to denying these opportunities to their opponent. In war turns, each theater can bring great rewards of conquest and prestige, but territorial gains can disappear at the treaty table. At the end of the century, will the British rule an empire on which the sun never sets?

719	180974	Potion Explosion	Potion Explosion is a game for 2 to 4 players by Horrible Games.&#10;It was designed by Lorenzo Silva, Andrea Crespi and Stefano Castelli.&#10;&#10;Dear students, it's time for the final exams of the Potions class! The rules are always the same: Take an ingredient marble from the dispenser and watch the others fall. If you connect marbles of the same color, they explode and you can take them, too! Complete your potions using the marbles you collect, and drink them to unleash their magical power. Remember, though, that to win the Student of the Year award, being quick won't be enough: you'll also need to brew the most valuable potions in Potion Explosion!&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/vwjYMFporFhvAU48k73MIw__original/img/6sAfG89R42SJRv2wjiItRTMmcoQ=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic7298696.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/vwjYMFporFhvAU48k73MIw__thumb/img/uNBrY-gqZLq7aiv1E_pDsc3vmyE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7298696.jpg
727	290359	Undaunted: North Africa	The Undaunted series continues with this two-player deck-building game of tactical combat, pitting the raiders of Britain's Long Range Desert Group against Italian forces in the North African Theater of World War II.&#10;&#10;The North African campaign has begun. Take control of the British Army's Long Range Desert Group and operate behind enemy lines or command the formidable Italian forces opposing them. In &quot;Undaunted: North Africa&quot;, a sequel to Undaunted: Normandy, players once again lead their sides through a varied series of missions. As casualties mount, wounded soldiers leave the players' decks, forcing them to adapt in the face of changing tactical circumstances. Use your cards to strengthen your forces, deploy vehicles to advance rapidly across the battlefield, and seize the initiative as you determine the outcome of the North African Theater.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;	\N	2	2	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Zp0x_lURkRrHcLyyYv2aSw__original/img/xk-EPbXMZ8ut9LAMobKNsro6cSw=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5536142.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Zp0x_lURkRrHcLyyYv2aSw__thumb/img/d9luLahO6n0itCfqpjpLexz24OE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5536142.jpg
720	128996	1775: Rebellion	The Birth of America series continues with The American Revolution.&#10;&#10;In 1775: Rebellion, players take the roles of the American Continental Army and Patriots against the British Army and the Loyalists. Each side tries to control the colonies, provinces and territories. They call on the aid of Native Americans, as well as the German Hessians and French Army in order to successfully birth a revolution or quell the rebellion. The four factions each use their own deck of cards to move their units into positions. Battles are resolved quickly with custom dice. If you can control an entire colony, province or territory you raise a flag. When the game ends with the signing of the Treaty of Paris, the side with the most flag markers is the winner.&#10;&#10;1775: Rebellion uses the same basic mechanisms as 1812: The Invasion of Canada, but to a different end result. The game is quicker (being 2-4 player) and the intermingling of units at the beginning of the game allows the action to start immediately. There are a few core rules that changed in order to better portray the goals of the war.&#10;&#10;The game also comes with an advanced scenario, &quot;The Siege of Quebec&quot;. We recommend this for players comfortable with the basic rules.&#10;&#10;Winner of BGG &quot;Golden Geek 2013&quot; Award for &quot;Best Wargame.&quot;&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/rTKzRG0b8CtQWYqmCC353w__original/img/Qvg98VUzuZQZsRtE4sgn5dDSokE=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1386705.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/rTKzRG0b8CtQWYqmCC353w__thumb/img/fivxQMJoJqReqc7c2yghuAFP9Uk=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1386705.jpg
721	240196	Betrayal Legacy	Betrayal Legacy marries the concept of Betrayal at House on the Hill &mdash; exploring a haunted mansion &mdash; with the permanency and multi-game storytelling exhibited by Daviau's Risk Legacy and other legacy games that followed. Betrayal Legacy consists of a prologue and a thirteen-chapter story that takes place over decades. Players represent families, with specific members of a family participating in one story, then perhaps an older version of those characters (assuming they lived) or their descendants showing up in later stories.&#10;&#10;Why would people keep exploring a haunted mansion for decade after decade, especially when horrible things happen there? Curiosity, I suppose, or perhaps an ignorant boldness that comes from the belief that we know better than those who have come before. Look at all that we've learned, marvel at the tools we have at hand! Surely we'll all exit safely this time...&#10;&#10;As with other Betrayal titles, the game is narratively-driven, with elements that record the history of your specific games. The tools mentioned earlier, for example, become attached to specific families. This isn't just a bucket; it's my bucket, the one my grandpappy used to feed his family's pigs when he was a boy, and while you can certainly use that bucket, I know how to wield it best from the time he spent teaching me how to slop. Yes, it's an heirloom bucket, and when kept in the family, I get a bonus for using it.&#10;&#10;	\N	3	5	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/F4-UGFUM3FfVLWsgBgpFLQ__original/img/Deoe1xN_faxfkaGFNaG-7l4WPvI=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4314964.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/F4-UGFUM3FfVLWsgBgpFLQ__thumb/img/qaqVSOIHvE3mPWEgX_lP7e-6yM0=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4314964.jpg
722	62227	Labyrinth: The War on Terror, 2001 – ?	2001: The &ldquo;American Century&rdquo; had closed with a single Cold War superpower standing and a pause in conflict that some at the time dubbed &ldquo;The End of History&rdquo;. It wasn&rsquo;t.&#10;&#10;In the Middle East and South Asia, an Islamic revival was underway. Resentments bred in part of US support for the regions&rsquo; anti-Soviet tyrannies soon erupted into a new struggle against the West. Wealthy Saudi fanatic Usama bin Ladin issued a declaration of holy war against America in 1996 and then fired the first shots with spectacular terrorist attacks on US targets in East Africa in 1998 and the Arab Peninsula in 2000. Bin Ladin&rsquo;s al-Qaeda organization plotted securely under the protection of the Taliban, a fundamentalist movement in Afghanistan born of the anti-Soviet &ldquo;Bear Trap&rdquo; of the 1980s. By 2001, al-Qaeda had set in motion even more devastating strikes &mdash; this time within the US Homeland &mdash; that Bin Ladin hoped would light off a global Muslim uprising. Uprising or not, the Western response to those September 11th attacks would reshape international affairs from London to Jakarta and from Moscow to Dar es Salaam.&#10;&#10;Labyrinth takes 1 or 2 players inside the Islamist jihad and the global war on terror. With broad scope, ease of play, and a never-ending variety of event combinations similar to GMT&rsquo;s highly popular Twilight Struggle, Labyrinth portrays not only the US efforts to counter extremists&rsquo; use of terrorist tactics but the wider ideological struggle &mdash; guerrilla warfare, regime change, democratization, and much more.&#10;&#10;--description from publisher&#10;&#10;	\N	1	2	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Acd8VhTI7yrwGAYNLReurA__original/img/TX-jVs1cBZsgY_U_vgMYDNrxeU8=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic859584.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Acd8VhTI7yrwGAYNLReurA__thumb/img/xhSrUlTrFh9mJVlezWTow3UPUOg=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic859584.jpg
723	383179	Age of Innovation	Age of Innovation is a standalone game set in the world of Terra Mystica.&#10;&#10;Twelve factions, each with unique characteristics, populate this world of varying terrains. Here you will compete to erect buildings and merge them into cities. Each game allows you to create new combinations of factions, homelands, and abilities so that each game isn't the same as another.&#10;&#10;You control one of these factions and will terraform the game map's terrain into your homelands where you can erect your buildings. Proximity to other factions may limit your expansion, but it also gains you significant advantages in the game. This tension adds to the appeal of the Terra Mystica series.&#10;&#10;Upgrade your buildings to gain valuable resources such as tools, scholars, money, and power. Build schools to advance in different sciences and collect books, which you can use to make innovations.

A team of scientists must neutralize her and capture the baby raptors before they run wild into the forest.&#10;&#10;Raptor is a card-driven board game with tactical play and some double guessing. Players use their cards to move their pawns &mdash; with the scientists on one side, Mother and baby raptors on the other &mdash; on the board. Every round, the player who played the lowest ranked card can use the corresponding action, while their opponent has movement or attack points equal to the difference between the values of the two cards. The scientists can use fire, can move by jeep on the tracks, and can even call for reinforcements, while the mamma raptor can hide in the bushes, yell to frighten the scientists, and call for her babies.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	2	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/-Ro5KFX55FbZBWehBy9LKg__original/img/17jLBJbMVzZssJLpRh503itz008=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic6974678.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/-Ro5KFX55FbZBWehBy9LKg__thumb/img/yHZjXqMjgYpXCZZDVQsCJfABYA4=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6974678.jpg
725	295895	Distilled	Distilled is a highly thematic strategy card game about crafting spirits in a distillery, with resource management and push-your-luck elements. In the game, you have inherited a distillery and are hoping to someday achieve the title of master distiller through purchasing goods, building up your distillery, and creating the world's most renowned spirits.&#10;&#10;Use cards to purchase new ingredients and invest in upgrades to your distillery, all while eventually distilling the spirit and sending it to the warehouse. Once in the warehouse, age your spirit to enhance its flavor and bottle it to sell it for major profits!&#10;&#10;Achieve the title of Master Distiller by having the most victory points at the end of the game.

728	17405	1846: The Race for the Midwest	1846 is an 18xx game that traces the westward expansion of railways across the Midwestern United States.&#10;&#10;As in other 18XX games, the winner is the player with the greatest combined wealth (cash on hand + value of stock held + value of private companies owned) at the end of the game.  Play proceeds in a series of stock rounds, each followed by a pair of operating rounds.  In stock rounds, players act as investors buying and selling stock in corporations.  During operating rounds, corporations will lay track, build stations, run trains for revenue to be paid out as dividends or withheld, and buy trains.  The majority shareholder of each corporation acts at its president, making all decisions during operating rounds.  Players will continue operating companies, collecting dividends, and reinvesting until the bank breaks.&#10;&#10;1846 features several unique elements, such as scaling the number of corporations, private companies, and bank size to the number of players.  Additionally, the traditional starting private company auction has been replaced with a private company draft, introducing hidden information and a degree of randomness.  Corporations that run a train from the East coast to the West will receive additional revenue.  Moreover, virtually all track builds will incur costs, bringing corporate capitalization and long term financing questions to the fore.&#10;&#10;An unofficial 2-player variant from the designer has been made available in the files section.&#10;&#10;	\N	3	5	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/zRZkmUtRhHosQNrcsYquOg__original/img/26Rizb3LBWjVmzHplrYCPcOnZS0=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4001497.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/zRZkmUtRhHosQNrcsYquOg__thumb/img/1l7TYgRKw5INM3_PNSsjAqBloAs=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4001497.jpg
729	245654	Railroad Ink: Deep Blue Edition	In the multiplayer puzzle game Railroad Ink, your goal is to connect as many exits on your board as possible. Each round, a set of dice are rolled in the middle of the table, determining which kind of road and railway routes are available to all players. You have to draw these routes on your erasable boards to create transport lines and connect your exits, trying to optimize the available symbols better than your opponents.&#10;&#10;The more exits you connect, the more points you score at the end of the game, but you lose points for each incomplete route, so plan carefully! Will you press your luck and try to stretch your transportation network to the next exit, or will you play it safe and start a new, simpler to manage route?&#10;&#10;Railroad Ink comes in two versions, each one including two expansions with additional dice sets that add new special rules to your games. The Deep Blue Edition includes the Rivers and Lakes expansions. Increase the difficulty by adding the River route into the mix, or use the Lakes to connect your networks by ferry. These special rules can spice up things and make each game play and feel different. Each box allows you to play from 1 to 6 players, and if you combine more boxes, you can play with up to 12 players (or more). The only limit to the number of players is the number of boards you have!&#10;&#10;	\N	1	6	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/x3hjEgkxZE9M96o6wgj6Tw__original/img/aLU9rLTBaZhBK_U6YMUY8mmJnrM=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic4097632.png	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/x3hjEgkxZE9M96o6wgj6Tw__thumb/img/idn6fyLMcqvmxqKXU57rAuLgMvg=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4097632.png
730	13	CATAN	In CATAN (formerly The Settlers of Catan), players try to be the dominant force on the island of Catan by building settlements, cities, and roads. On each turn dice are rolled to determine what resources the island produces. Players build by spending resources (sheep, wheat, wood, brick and ore) that are depicted by these resource cards; each land type, with the exception of the unproductive desert, produces a specific resource: hills produce brick, forests produce wood, mountains produce ore, fields produce wheat, and pastures produce sheep.&#10;&#10;Set-up includes randomly placing large hexagonal tiles (each showing a resource or the desert) in a honeycomb shape and surrounding them with water tiles, some of which contain ports of exchange. Number disks, which will correspond to die rolls (two 6-sided dice are used), are placed on each resource tile. Each player is given two settlements (think: houses) and roads (sticks) which are, in turn, placed on intersections and borders of the resource tiles. Players collect a hand of resource cards based on which hex tiles their last-placed house is adjacent to. A robber pawn is placed on the desert tile.&#10;&#10;A turn consists of possibly playing a development card, rolling the dice, everyone (perhaps) collecting resource cards based on the roll and position of houses (or upgraded cities&mdash;think: hotels) unless a 7 is rolled, turning in resource cards (if possible and desired) for improvements, trading cards at a port, and trading resource cards with other players. If a 7 is rolled, the active player moves the robber to a new hex tile and steals resource cards from other players who have built structures adjacent to that tile.&#10;&#10;Points are accumulated by building settlements and cities, having the longest road and the largest army (from some of the development cards), and gathering certain development cards that simply award victory points. When a player has gathered 10 points (some of which may be held in secret), he announces his total and claims the win.&#10;&#10;CATAN has won multiple awards and is one of the most popular games in recent history due to its amazing ability to appeal to experienced gamers as well as those new to the hobby.&#10;&#10;Die Siedler von Catan was originally published by KOSMOS and has gone through multiple editions. It was licensed by Mayfair and has undergone four editions as The Settlers of Catan. In 2015, it was formally renamed CATAN to better represent itself as the core and base game of the CATAN series. It has been re-published in two travel editions, portable edition and compact edition, as a special gallery edition (replaced in 2009 with a family edition), as an anniversary wooden edition, as a deluxe 3D collector's edition, in the basic Simply Catan, as a beginner version, and with an entirely new theme in Japan and Asia as Settlers of Catan: Rockman Edition. Numerous spin-offs and expansions have also been made for the game.&#10;&#10;	\N	3	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/W3Bsga_uLP9kO91gZ7H8yw__original/img/xV7oisd3RQ8R-k18cdWAYthHXsA=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2419375.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/W3Bsga_uLP9kO91gZ7H8yw__thumb/img/8a9HeqFydO7Uun_le9bXWPnidcA=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2419375.jpg

733	119506	Freedom: The Underground Railroad	Early in the history of the United States, slavery was an institution that seemed unmovable but with efforts of men and women across the country, it was toppled. In Freedom: The Underground Railroad, players are working to build up the strength of the Abolitionist movement through the use of notable figures and pivotal events. By raising support for the cause and moving slaves to freedom in Canada, the minds of Americans can be changed and the institution of slavery can be brought down.&#10;&#10;Freedom is a card-driven, cooperative game for one to four players in which the group is working for the abolitionist movement to help bring an end to slavery in the United States. The players use a combination of cards, which feature figures and events spanning from Early Independence until the Civil War, along with action tokens and the benefits of their role to impact the game.&#10;&#10;Players need to strike the right balance between freeing slaves from plantations in the south and raising funds which are desperately needed to allow the group to continue their abolitionist activities as well as strengthen the cause.&#10;&#10;The goal is not easy and in addition to people and events that can have a negative impact on the group's progress, there are also slave catchers roaming the board, reacting to the movements of the slaves on the board and hoping to catch the runaway slaves and send them back to the plantations.&#10;&#10;Through careful planning and working together, the group might see an end to slavery in their time.&#10;&#10;	\N	1	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/eEUq1DqkPjVdSTJT4wp1zg__original/img/43O0Wj3fkQZaqYGVjWFL-DP5j5w=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1478723.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/eEUq1DqkPjVdSTJT4wp1zg__thumb/img/GnUZDpuILEw0EMvhmskCfve3l4w=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1478723.jpg

735	21790	Thurn and Taxis	In Thurn &amp; Taxis, players build post office routes across Bavaria and the regions around, collecting bonus points in various ways. The board shows a map of all the cities, with roads leading from each one to some of its neighbors. There are various colored regions around the board, most with two or three cities, and a large region with all the Bavarian cities in the center.&#10;&#10;Players build postal routes from city to city to city so that each city is adjacent to the next city on the route and there is a road connecting these two cities. Each route must consist of at least three cities. Players may build only one route at a time. Routes are represented by melded city cards arranged in the order of the route.&#10;&#10;Players start with a supply of 20 post offices in their color, a carriage house card, and a player aid card. The board is populated with bonus tiles, carriage cards and city cards. On a turn, a player will draw a card from a display of six, face-up city cards (or the top of the face-down deck) and meld one card, either starting a new route or adding to the current one. If after adding to the route, the length of the route is at least three cities, the player may declare it finished and score it. The player may, depending on the length of the route and which cities are in the route, place post offices in the cities, collect bonus tiles, and acquire a higher value carriage. Optionally, the player may receive support from one postal official in the form of drawing a second card, melding a second card, refreshing the six city card display, or acquiring a higher value carriage than the route length when finishing a route. Once a route is scored, the city cards of that route are discarded, and the player begins a new route on their next turn.&#10;&#10;When a player exhausts their supply of post offices or acquires a value 7 carriage, the end of the game is triggered. Play continues until the player who is last in turn order finishes their turn, and the game ends. Players score points for their highest valued carriage and bonus tiles, then lose points for unplaced post offices. The player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;The fact that you *must* add at least one city to your route each turn or lose the whole route gives the game an enjoyable planning element.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/OlwMFxx9t6HGndTSKaWxhg__original/img/SPiwIEJ1u6hBJtG4p4BrCgrPwDs=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic115300.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/OlwMFxx9t6HGndTSKaWxhg__thumb/img/Fz4ZowJ6MyHSUTZv6XVPs5w4NM0=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic115300.jpg
736	156009	Port Royal	The merchant players in Port Royal, which won the Austrian Game Designers Competition under the title H&auml;ndler der Karibik, are trying to earn as much as they can out of the Caribbean Sea, but if they set their goals too high, they might take home nothing for the day.&#10;&#10;The 120-card deck depicts a coin on the back of each card &mdash; with players earning and paying coins throughout the game &mdash; and different items on the card fronts. On a turn, a player can first draw as many cards as he likes, one at a time from the deck, placing them in the harbor (an area near the deck). Each card shows one of the following:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Person, who stays in a face-up row next to deck.&#10;     Ship, which the player can attack immediately if he has enough swords on his people cards, after which the ship is discarded; otherwise, the ship stays in the harbor.&#10;     Expedition, which remains above the harbor until a player fulfills it by discarding people who have the items required for the expedition.&#10;     Tax Increase, which forces everyone with twelve or more coins to discard half their money, after which the card is discarded.&#10;&#10;&#10;If the player draws a ship with the same name as a ship already in the harbor, he's spent too much time dilly-dallying and his turn ends (after using the ship to attack, if possible), with all the cards in the harbor being discarded. Otherwise, the player can stop whenever he likes, then use/acquire one card if three or fewer ships are in the harbor, two cards if four ships are present, and three cards if five ships are present. Players rob ships, collecting the number of coins shown on them, then discarding the card, while they hire people, paying the number of coins depicted. After the active player takes his 1-3 cards, each other player may pay the active player one coin in order to take one card in the same way.&#10;&#10;When one player has at least twelve influence points &mdash; which are on both people and expedition cards &mdash; the game is played to the end of the round, giving everyone the same number of turns, then the player with the most influence points wins.&#10;&#10;&bull; Port Royal differs from H&auml;ndler der Karibik in that it includes ten more cards to allow for play with up to five players and players can win without fulfilling an expedition.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	5	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/9lQIIxg_l6G-ZWmTqEHlOA__original/img/NglW8f48YV2Guo7yAcHjPc-wKMM=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1949286.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/9lQIIxg_l6G-ZWmTqEHlOA__thumb/img/uiCYTRqVF3TMqfpFGM-O0az_Q4A=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1949286.jpg
737	97786	Small World Underground	&quot;This world's not big enough for all of us, so it's time you step aside to make room for me.&quot;&#10;&#10;That's the spirit of Philippe Keyaerts' award-winning Small World, and the 2011 release Small World Underground is a standalone game that keeps that spirit intact, while putting a new spin on the game play.&#10;&#10;Small World Underground includes 15 fantasy-themed races of creatures along with 21 special powers. Each player will control several creature/power combinations over the course of the game &ndash; spending points to draft these combinations &ndash; and will use those creatures to claim control of various subterranean locations. Some locations hold relics or are designated as &quot;places of power&quot;, and monsters must first be conquered before a player can claim these special benefits. At the end of each turn, a player scores points for the regions he holds, and the player with the most points at game end wins.&#10;&#10;Small World Underground is playable on its own, but can be combined with other Small World releases. The publisher recommends that players be familiar with Small World before playing Small World Underground.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	5	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/qFmyurPNiCM8UPtP38mQpg__original/img/0464mabR0gCe0rmZCKpW-Y1RBWg=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic979889.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/qFmyurPNiCM8UPtP38mQpg__thumb/img/wLG6hiX2QNkrZCG5bnZqLJB6Pio=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic979889.jpg
740	142379	Escape Plan	After a successful bank heist, you and your fellow thieves are laying low and enjoying the good life. Most of the cash has been hidden away, and the rest has been invested in businesses throughout the city. Everything is going according to plan until the police get a breakthrough in their investigation. Accusations are made, fingers are pointed, and after a heated argument, you decide to go your separate ways.&#10; Chaos ensues as the SWAT team is called in and start to close off the city&rsquo;s exits. Your only choice now is to escape the city before it is completely locked down. But you need a plan &mdash; a good route that allows you to leave the city while recovering as much of the money as possible.&#10; You will need to call in some favors and hire the local gangs to create diversions. Bribing the Police would be a good idea too, but it isn't cheap. Disguises may help, but they don&rsquo;t fool everyone. Setting the Police on the trail of your former colleagues will give you a better chance of escape, but the other thieves are thinking the same thing...&#10; Will you escape the city with the most money, or will the Police lockdown the city before you can escape?&#10;&#10;In Escape Plan, players are the thieves, but they may influence the cops' moves every turn. The robbers move on a modular board trying to reach the best spots to recover their loot and escape from the city with more money than the other thieves. The cops are trying to thwart their escape plan &mdash; by force if necessary. The players play cards to aid their escape and slow the other players down. The players take actions that allow them to move and to engage gangs, mules, and snitches.&#10;&#10;It contains asymmetric roles set by missions that players may achieve during the game while avoiding the police. The players' roles as thieves are individual with every player for themselves. In the end, only the player who escapes with the most cash wins.&#10;&#10;The game design is influenced by great heist films.&#10;&#10;	\N	1	5	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/J-sgq_IT2g6WfnuMY7Y8PA__original/img/GZDhrKUFllmCwVdvcPpSYthyyq0=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4178038.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/J-sgq_IT2g6WfnuMY7Y8PA__thumb/img/fSUSmbc2mpUwV2ErYG7X1Y-xuVM=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4178038.jpg
741	252328	Star Wars: X-Wing (Second Edition)	X-Wing Second Edition puts you in command of your own squadron of advanced starfighters locked in thrilling, tactical space combat. Following in the footsteps of the first edition, the second edition refines the intuitive and exciting core formula of maneuvering your ships into position by placing a central focus on the visceral thrill of flying starships in the Star Wars galaxy.&#10;&#10;During a battle, you&rsquo;ll use your squadron&rsquo;s unique capabilities to give yourself an advantage in the thick of combat. Each X-Wing ship flies differently, with its own set of maneuvers ranging from gentle banks to aggressive Koiogran turns. As in the game&rsquo;s first edition, you&rsquo;ll need to use every ship&rsquo;s maneuvering capabilities to the fullest in order to strategically position your ships. A round begins with players secretly selecting a maneuver on each of their ships&rsquo; unique maneuver dials. Once you&rsquo;ve decided how each of your ships is going to fly, you&rsquo;ll begin revealing the dials and moving your ships, starting with the lowest skilled pilots.&#10;&#10;As you move, you&rsquo;ll enter a tense duel with your opponent as you both try to line up the perfect shot. Before you can open fire on an opponent&rsquo;s ship, however, they must be in your firing arc and within range. By carefully selecting your maneuvers, you can get enemy ships in your sights, and once you&rsquo;ve locked onto your target, you&rsquo;re free to choose your plan of attack. You might pepper the enemy with blaster fire to whittle away their shields. Or, you could go for massive damage and launch a devastating volley of proton torpedoes. No matter how you approach the battle, you have complete control of your squadron. One player wins when all of their opponent&rsquo;s ships are destroyed!&#10;&#10;Slick flying is certainly important, but it isn&rsquo;t the only consideration you&rsquo;ll have to make in the midst of a dogfight. As in the first edition of X-Wing, once your ships have completed a maneuver, you can also perform an action to gain the upper hand. Whether you choose to acquire a target lock on a rival ship or barrel roll out of an enemy&rsquo;s firing arc, the actions you take affect the course of the battle and determine the fate of your squadron.&#10;&#10;Now, in the second edition of the game, your actions offer greater strategic depth than ever before. Some actions are red and induce stress when they are used. Other actions may be linked, allowing you to chain two actions together and push the limits of how your ship can handle in a dogfight!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;	\N	2	2	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/oPYTn7JgqxEsOuJ835WQnw__original/img/f4EpXqRON_VQ94prr6UM4tBabRk=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4271201.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/oPYTn7JgqxEsOuJ835WQnw__thumb/img/y_5FVvxtWBMIUHSzK3xOqps2IVc=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4271201.jpg
742	338834	MicroMacro: Crime City – Full House	Crimes have taken place all over the city, and you want to figure out exactly what's happened, so you'll need to look closely at the giant city map (75 x 110 cm) to find all the hidden information and trace the trails of those who had it in for their foes.&#10;&#10;MicroMacro: Crime City &ndash; Full House includes 16 cases for you to solve. Each case includes a number of cards that ask you to find something on the map or uncover where someone has gone or otherwise reveal information relevant to a case. The city map serves as a map in time as well as space, so you'll typically find people in multiple locations throughout the streets and buildings, and you need to piece together what happened, whether by going through the case card by card or by reading only the starting card in the case and trying to figure out everything that happened for yourself. Will you be able to answer all questions about the case without fail?&#10;&#10;Unlike the original MicroMacro: Crime City, Full House marks each case with symbols so that parents can decide which cases the youngest investigators are cleared to research.&#10;&#10;	\N	1	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/bNuZIssobDbFYaLbgMofgw__original/img/_UyVrUsVU_AZNO93QmcosKGs0TA=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic6242068.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/bNuZIssobDbFYaLbgMofgw__thumb/img/VEB-DHKUWobYsUOFwuywHnsbF2k=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6242068.jpg
743	9674	Ingenious	In Ingenious, a.k.a. Einfach Genial, players take turns placing colored domino-style tiles on a game board, scoring for each line of colored symbols that they enlarge. The trick, however, is that a player's score is equal to their worst-scoring color, not their best, so they need to score for all colors instead of specializing in only one or two.&#10;&#10;In more detail, the game includes 120 domino-style tiles, each consisting of two conjoined hexes; each hex has one of six colors in it, with most tiles having different-colored hexes. Each player has a rack with six tiles on it, and on a turn a player places one tile from their rack onto two hexes of the game board. For each hex on this tile, they score one point in that color for each hex of the same color that lies adjacent to it and each hex in a straight line from it. If a player brings the score of a color to 18, they immediately take another turn. At the end of their turn, they refill their rack to six tiles. (Before refilling their rack, if they have no tiles on it that contain hexes in their lowest-scoring color, they can discard all of their tiles, then draw six new tiles from the bag.)&#10;&#10;When no more tiles can be placed on the game board or when one player scores 18 in each color, the game ends. Players then compare their lowest scores, and whoever has the highest low score wins.&#10;&#10;Ingenious includes rules for solitaire and team play; in the latter case, two teams of two play, with each player not being able to see their partner's tiles and teams keeping a combined score that maxes out at 36 instead of 18.&#10;&#10;	\N	1	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/_qEEUfI9DxtfVxYCerAvsQ__original/img/2s1PbJDhGgIHkdF_-_S3dmcTW_8=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic7633115.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/_qEEUfI9DxtfVxYCerAvsQ__thumb/img/03ERw7OIGzvbuGKm3L5fWO1bqFQ=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7633115.jpg
744	311988	Frostpunk: The Board Game	In Frostpunk: The Board Game, up to four players will take on the role of leaders of a small colony of survivors in a post-apocalyptic world that was hit by a severe ice age. Their duty is to effectively manage both its infrastructure and citizens. The core gameplay will be brutal, challenging, and complex, but easy to learn. The citizens won&rsquo;t just be speechless pieces on the board. Society members will issue demands and react accordingly to the current mood, so every decision and action bears consequences.&#10;&#10;The players will decide the fate of their people. Will you treat them like another resource? Are you going to be an inspiring builder, a fearless explorer, or a bright scientist? Is your rule going to be a sting of tyranny or an era of law and equality?&#10;&#10;The game is based on a bestseller video game by 11bit studios, the creators of This War Of Mine. The original (digital) edition of Frostpunk is a highly successful strategy-survival-city-builder, a BAFTA-nominee that originally launched in 2018.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;	\N	1	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/YYfgspTCAgBC0rqbD4U3pQ__original/img/vdnpP4PPsidTc7lBMnBBSujQMZc=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic7247536.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/YYfgspTCAgBC0rqbD4U3pQ__thumb/img/y3eTVayRzfZrS5FPeh-egX_uFW8=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7247536.jpg
851	110277	Among the Stars	Among the Stars takes place in a war-ravaged galaxy where the warring alien races have declared peace in the wake of a threat with the potential to destroy them all. An Alliance is established to build space stations throughout the galaxy in order to promote trade among the races, strengthen diplomatic relations, and defend against this impending threat. Each player takes the role of one of those races trying to build the greatest space station. Through card drafting, the players select locations, and use these to build their station, scoring victory points based on the placement. The construction lasts four years, and the alien race with the most points at the end wins.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/xM5-XAyoh7NwuVoguwgEsQ__original/img/JJ3gcJBHOc0-ca-Hq73wYvZRZxk=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2037906.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/xM5-XAyoh7NwuVoguwgEsQ__thumb/img/0Qo56PUZiko4GpS2hZ5R8q-z5VA=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2037906.jpg
745	6249	Alhambra	Granada, 1278. At the foot of the Sierra Nevada mountains, one of the most exciting and interesting project of the Spanish Middle Ages begins: the construction of the ALHAMBRA.&#10;&#10;The best master builders in the whole of Europe and Arabia want to demonstrate their skill.  Employ the most suitable teams of builders and make sure that you always have enough of the right currency.  Because no matter whether they are stonemasons from the north or horticulturalists from the south, they all want a proper wage and insist on their &quot;native&quot; currency.  With their help towers can be constructed, gardens laid out, pavilions and arcades erected and seraglios and chambers built.&#10;&#10;In Alhambra, players are acquiring buildings to be placed within their Alhambra complex.&#10;&#10;The money in Alhambra comes in four different currencies and is available in the open money market.  The 54 buildings of six types become available for purchase in the building market four at a time; one building is available in each of the four different currencies.  On a player's turn, a player may 1) take money from the open money market, 2) purchase a building from the building market and either place it in his Alhambra or reserve, or 3) engage in construction and re-construction projects with buildings that have been placed in the player's Alhambra or reserve. The game rewards efficiency, as when a player purchases a building from the market for the exact amount of money, the player may take another turn.&#10;&#10;Players with the most buildings in each of the six building types in his Alhambra score in each of the scoring phases, and points are awarded for players' longest external &quot;wall&quot; section within their complex. The game ends when the building market can no longer be replenished from the building tile supply, and there is a final scoring, whereupon the player with the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;Integrates with:&#10;&#10;    Alhambra: The Dice Game (a variant in which you can combine Alhambra buildings with Alhambra dice.)&#10;&#10;&#10;	\N	2	6	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/OiqKsYDh7pqeRYKG__kMSw__original/img/Oe2ZTGE2hUnyZQIEoIjM_zwYfcY=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4893652.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/OiqKsYDh7pqeRYKG__kMSw__thumb/img/Pj2FP8bV-BHofcDS0eGLh8gzTmI=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4893652.jpg
746	206941	First Class: All Aboard the Orient Express!	In First Class: Unterwegs im Orient Express, players try to score as many fame points as possible by building a rich network of rails, by building luxurious train cars, or by serving well-paying passengers.&#10;&#10;From the Publisher's website:&#10;In the early days of the twentieth century, rail is the preferred mode of transportation for the elite. Luxury lines scramble to accommodate the needs of business tycoons, diplomats, and even royalty. Step into this world and compete to build the most luxurious train lines possible in First Class. Guide your lines from humble beginnings into rivals of the fabled Orient Express itself as you carry out actions each round. Add cars to your trains, upgrade those cars to attract wealthier clientele, extend your lines towards Constantinople, and more. A limited number of action cards is available each round, so pick your actions carefully and choose a path for your rail lines. There are many ways to score points, but only a true railroad baron will accumulate the most points and win the game.&#10;&#10;First Class is a card game that includes aspects of board games, creating a unique and dynamic experience every time you play. Cards represent your train cars and provide a visual reminder of your empire's growth as they extend out from your player board. On top of that, every game of First Class uses two of five interchangeable decks of action cards. Each deck provides new challenges for building your rail empire. One game might have you catering to the celebrities on your trains and fulfilling contracts along your route, while another game asks you to accommodate passengers and their luggage while you get swept up in a murder mystery. Each combination of modules opens many possible strategies and provides even more thematic flair.

747	328565	Caper: Europe	Your role as criminal mastermind is to recruit a crew of thieves, send them to locations across Europe, and provide them with gear. It's your job to utilize your resources efficiently to steal goods, but being a great mastermind is about more than the things you walk away with. It's the thrill of a well thought-out plan coming together: the set-up, the sting. Properly deploy your thieves and gear to dominate locations, outmaneuver your opponent's plans, and win the night. You've got six rounds to plan and play your cards. Nothing like a tight timeline to up the stakes!&#10;&#10;Caper: Europe is a two-player drafting game. You take turns sending thieves to famous locations across Europe, vying for control through special card powers. These thieves have tricks up their sleeves, which you can enhance by adding gear to them. And controlling the locations isn't everything because priceless stolen goods await the thief who's clever enough to snatch them first.&#10;&#10;Your goal is to score the most points by winning locations, collecting stolen goods, and equipping thieves with their preferred gear.

748	171668	The Grizzled	The Grizzled is a cooperative game about survival in the trenches during the first World War where players win or lose together.&#10;&#10;Each round, the current team leader will choose how many cards every player draws. Then, going around the table, players must either play a card in their hand or back out of the mission. Each card represents either threats to the team (such as mortar shells and weather conditions) or negative personality traits (such as frightened or obsessive). At the end of the round, more cards are added to the draw deck. The game ends only if the players can deplete the draw deck as well as their hands without letting time run out.&#10;&#10;If one threat shows up too many times, the team fails the mission. The team must play their threats correctly in order to gain any progress. However, most of the information in a players hand remains secret throughout the game.&#10;&#10;Planning, teamwork, and a little luck are the tools you'll need to win this cooperative game for two to five players.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	5	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/5JuQCtSAeSZpAL3WgWdwow__original/img/hn5gRpKVlmB3Ds9gIxD7k2SrVt4=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic3719610.png	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/5JuQCtSAeSZpAL3WgWdwow__thumb/img/XcI-3g0sVumt8DsaMaBGrwftIRw=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3719610.png
749	31999	TZAAR	TZAAR is a game about making choices. Both players have 30 pieces, divided in three types: 6 Tzaars, 9 Tzarras and 15 Totts. The three types of pieces form a trinity: They cannot exist without each other. The aim is either to make the opponent run out of one of the three types of pieces or to put him in a position in which he cannot capture any more. The tricky question the players will have to ask themselves on each of their turns is: &ldquo;Shall I make myself stronger or my opponent weaker?&rdquo; Meaning: Will you capture an opponent&rsquo;s piece and make him weaker, or will you jump on top of one of your own pieces and make yourself stronger? If you choose to jump on top of your own pieces too often, you will probably leave your opponent with too many pieces on the board. On the other hand, if you capture too often, you may end up with pieces that are not strong enough at the end of the game. What to do? Up to you to decide!&#10;&#10;TZAAR replaced TAMSK as part of project GIPF, which was felt to not quite fit in with the others due to its use of sand timers.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	2	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/83RmBw8qTkDJo7qC-YY8og__original/img/b5t4-4APxLqV0PeOSa6FGib-OL8=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3607816.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/83RmBw8qTkDJo7qC-YY8og__thumb/img/E1zUB2Jka041LV1zypcMCZAh6eU=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3607816.jpg
750	65781	London	London lies devastated after the Great Fire of 1666. This is your opportunity to build a new city on the ashes of the old. It is up to you how you employ the talents of the people of London to this end. Will you favor the business classes, who will earn you money? Or would you prefer to spend more money than you can rightly afford on grand monuments and sumptuous palaces? You must also deal with the problem of rising poverty and how to employ the many paupers of the city. Throughout the game you will be forced to make tough decisions. To achieve one aim you must sacrifice another, which may open an opportunity for a competitor.&#10;&#10;London is a 2-4 player game with a playing time of approximately 90 minutes. Players select cards with varying powers of cashflow, victory points, and poverty penalties, and compete to manage them most efficiently. Nearly 250 years of progress is glimpsed in this game. Famous buildings and monuments of the era as well as engineering developments such as streetlights are illustrated on the cards.&#10;&#10;As with a lot of games, London is about scoring the most VPs.  Players manage their hand, selecting cards to play into their building display by laying them out in a line.  At some point a player will choose to run his city. They can activate their buildings in whatever order they prefer.  The resulting actions can generate money and VPs, reduce poverty or have some other effect specified on the card.  Some cards have an entry cost which must be paid before the action can be performed.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Wb9zwcnPNX-wSNvVcWYNjQ__original/img/_BZ-pageA8nbf1YZ7rASDjDoHa0=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic770317.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Wb9zwcnPNX-wSNvVcWYNjQ__thumb/img/XOY71ukn7QV-nwLSV3EmhuO46bM=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic770317.jpg

752	105551	Archipelago	In Archipelago, players are Renaissance European powers competing in the exploration of a Pacific or Caribbean archipelago. They will explore territories, harvest resources, use those resources in markets both internal (for their use and that of the natives) and foreign (to sell it in Europe), build markets, harbors, cities and temples, and negotiate among themselves (and maybe betray each other) &ndash; all this to complete their secret objectives. They will also need to guess the secret objective of the other players to be able to benefit from them.&#10;&#10;But players also need to be careful of the natives; if they make them too unhappy or if too many of them are unoccupied, they could revolt and declare independence. Then everyone will lose!&#10;&#10;According to the author, what he's tried to create is a &quot;German&quot; economic worker-placement game, but without the two things he dislikes in them: the superficial theme and the lack of interaction. Indeed this game includes a very present theme and a lot of negotiation and potential backstabbing.&#10;&#10;The game includes three sets of objectives, enabling players to choose between a short, medium and a long game. Solo play is also possible with an expansion.&#10;&#10;IN FRENCH&#10;Archipelago retrace l&rsquo;&egrave;re majestueuse de la d&eacute;couverte des archipels &agrave; travers le globe de 1492 (d&eacute;couverte des Antilles par Christophe Colomb) jusqu&rsquo;&agrave; 1797 (colonisation de Tahiti).&#10;Chaque joueur incarne un explorateur et son &eacute;quipe, mandat&eacute;s par une nation europ&eacute;enne pour d&eacute;couvrir, coloniser et exploiter les archipels. Ces missions sont cens&eacute;es s&rsquo;effectuer de mani&egrave;re diplomatique, en r&eacute;pondant tant aux besoins de la population locale qu&rsquo;aux demandes r&eacute;guli&egrave;res du continent. Il faudra donc respecter l&rsquo;archipel et ses autochtones sous peine de voir les natifs se r&eacute;volter pour finir en guerre d&rsquo;ind&eacute;pendance. Les limites entre expansionnisme et humanisme, &eacute;conomie et respect des valeurs locales, transmission de connaissances et industrialisation &agrave; outrance, ne sont pas toujours &eacute;videntes &agrave; trouver. L&rsquo;&eacute;quilibre de l&rsquo;archipel d&eacute;pendra donc beaucoup de la volont&eacute; que mettra chacun &agrave; faire de ces &icirc;les des colonies heureuses et productives, ou au contraire, &agrave; exploiter outrageusement les ressources et les natifs pour finir dans le chaos et la r&eacute;volte.&#10;Pour compliquer les choses, parmi vous se cache peut-&ecirc;tre un ind&eacute;pendantiste ou un pacifiste.

Score points for collecting the most sushi rolls or making a full set of sashimi. Dip your favorite nigiri in wasabi to triple its value! And once you've eaten it all, finish your meal with all the pudding you've got! But be careful which sushi you allow your friends to take; it might be just what they need to beat you!&#10;&#10;Sushi Go! takes the card-drafting mechanism of Fairy Tale and 7 Wonders and distills it into a twenty-minute game that anyone can play. The dynamics of &quot;draft and pass&quot; are brought to the fore, while keeping the rules to a minimum. As you see the first few hands of cards, you must quickly assess the make-up of the round and decide which type of sushi you'll go for. Then, each turn you'll need to weigh which cards to keep and which to pass on. The different scoring combinations allow for some clever plays and nasty blocks. Round to round, you must also keep your eye on the goal of having the most pudding cards at the end of the game!&#10;&#10;	\N	2	5	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Fn3PSPZVxa3YurlorITQ1Q__original/img/5vRsn2TT9eJmq27i9HtLWKpB_xs=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1900075.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Fn3PSPZVxa3YurlorITQ1Q__thumb/img/6XF493O0tSyLyZP5ArlcZrOTMXQ=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1900075.jpg
755	127398	Legends of Andor	Legends of Andor is a cooperative adventure board game for two to four players in which a band of heroes must work together to defend a fantasy realm from invading hordes. To secure Andor's borders, the heroes will embark on dangerous quests over the course of five unique scenarios (as well as a final scenario created by the players themselves). But as the clever game system keeps creatures on the march toward the castle, the players must balance their priorities carefully.&#10;&#10;At the heart of Legends of Andor is its unique narrative, the linked scenarios of which tell an overarching story as the players successfully complete objectives. For each scenario, or &quot;Legend&quot;, a legend deck conveys the plot of an ever-unfolding tale...one in which the players are the protagonists. A wooden marker moves along the board's legend track at key points during each scenario, triggering the draw of a new legend card, the introduction of new game-altering effects, and the advancement of the story's plot. In the end, the players must endeavor to guide the fate of Andor through their heroic actions, bringing a happy ending to their epic fantasy tale.&#10;&#10;Will their heroes roam the land completing quests in the name of glory, or devote themselves to the defense of the realm?

758	196326	Love Letter: Premium Edition	Love Letter Premium takes the familiar Love Letter game and enhances it in two different ways. First, the cards are supersized and much thicker than normal, the hearts that players claim are large and wooden, and the hard-sided box has a magnetic closure.&#10;&#10;Second, the game now plays with up to eight players thanks to the inclusion of an additional set of cards, such as the Assassin (0) which eliminates an opponent if that opponent forces you to reveal it and the Sycophant (4) who must be the target of a played card until it's covered on the next turn.

759	95527	Madeira	Madeira is an island officially discovered early in the 15th century by Portuguese seafarers. Madeira, the Portuguese word for wood, refers to the dense forest that covered its wild, fertile landscape. This, and its strategic position far into the Atlantic Ocean made the island one of the most significant Portuguese discoveries. Madeira served as a &ldquo;laboratory&rdquo; for what would become the Portuguese Empire.&#10;&#10;Wheat plantations were the first means for survival on the island. After that, when D. Henrique decided to increase the economy of the Empire, sugar became the core business of Madeira. Once sugar started coming from other places in the world, such as Africa and Brazil, profits from sugar were no longer enough, and production of the very famous Madeira wine became the most important economic product of the island.&#10;&#10;Players try to adapt themselves to these constraints, working to find better fields for farming the right goods and for obtaining precious wood, essential for erecting new structures in the cities and for building ships. In turn, the ships are crucial for trading in foreign markets, as well as for taking part in new expeditions to discover other countries.&#10;Madeira has been established just as it was in the original administrative division of the island under 3 captaincies (Funchal, Machico, and Porto Santo), where the ultimate goal is to develop the Island, gaining the most prestige under and for the Portuguese Crown.&#10;&#10;The Crown of Portugal has a series of requests regarding expeditions, urbanization, opening trade routes, increasing wealth, and controlling the guilds on the islands. Three times during the game, the players gain prestige for fulfilling certain requests by the Crown. At two other times, the Crown requests that the islands change the focus of their agriculture due to the changes in the world.&#10;&#10;Players must carefully choose the correct timing to show their achievements. Too early and you don&rsquo;t gain as much prestige, too late and you risk someone else stealing the best opportunities. Will you have what it takes to excel in all of these endeavors?&#10;Beware, wheat may become scarce, money is never enough, the population is hungry, and the shadow of piracy looms large&hellip;.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/wY6k5MmdPH3NVXsJ-SgtMw__original/img/I-0fr4331yRjHcjZlXiSzq0Lbnw=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1762708.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/wY6k5MmdPH3NVXsJ-SgtMw__thumb/img/Su3JBW4OIe8Qt6nXEyUcMOJtqsM=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1762708.jpg
761	18	RoboRally	The robots of the Robo Rally automobile factory spend their weekdays toiling at the assembly line. They put in hard hours building high-speed supercars they never get to see in action. But on Saturday nights, the factory becomes a world of mad machines and dangerous schemes as these robots engage in their own epic race.It takes speed, wits, and dirty tricks to become a racing legend! Each player chooses a robot and directs its moves by playing cards. Chaos ensues as all players reveal the cards they've chosen. Players face obstacles like industrial lasers, gaping pits, and moving conveyor belts -- but those can also be used to their advantage! Each player aims to make it to each of the checkpoints in numerical order. The first player to reach all of the checkpoints wins. (source: http://avalonhill.wizards.com/games/robo-rally/comingsoon)&#10;&#10;In RoboRally players each control a different robot in a race through a dangerous factory floor. Several goals will be placed on the board and you must navigate your robot to them in a specific order. The boards can be combined in several different ways to accommodate different player counts and races can be as long or as short as player's desire.&#10;&#10;In general, players will first fill all of their robot's &quot;registers&quot; with facedown movement cards. This happens simultaneously and there is a time element involved. If you don't act fast enough you are forced to place cards randomly to fill the rest. Then, starting with the first register, everyone reveals their card. The card with the highest number moves first. After everyone resolves their movement they reveal the next card and so on. Examples of movement cards may be to turn 90 degrees left or right, move forward 2 spaces, or move backward 1 space though there are a bigger variety than that. You can plan a perfect route, but if another robot runs into you it can push you off course. This can be disastrous since you can't reprogram any cards to fix it!&#10;&#10;Robots fire lasers and factory elements resolve after each movement and robots may become damaged. If they take enough damage certain movement cards become fixed and can no longer be changed. If they take more they may be destroyed entirely. The first robot to claim all the goals in the correct order wins, though some may award points and play tournament style.&#10;&#10;The game was reprinted by Avalon Hill (Hasbro/WotC) in 2005.&#10;&#10;UPC 742818050029&#10;&#10;	\N	2	8	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/eJx8hRJ6-86C2VrhECwEPA__original/img/-9I8B82hDOO1n0h9urwZUdz6bqc=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1000553.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/eJx8hRJ6-86C2VrhECwEPA__thumb/img/J1PlqFqtN-hxuXM4eEi-ekANPP4=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1000553.jpg
762	90419	Airlines Europe	Before Ticket to Ride, before Santa Fe Rails, before Union Pacific &ndash; yet after Acquire &ndash; there was Airlines, one of the earliest published games from designer Alan R. Moon and publisher ABACUSSPIELE.&#10;&#10;More than two decades after the publication of that game, Moon and ABACUSSPIELE present Airlines Europe, the design of which Moon began in 2007. According to the publisher, &quot;He wanted to preserve the feel of the original game and its successor, Union Pacific, while confronting the player with even more exciting choices.&quot; The result of that redesign process is Airlines Europe, featuring a reduced playing time, a new point structure, a European setting, and 112 tiny detailed airplanes.&#10;&#10;At its heart, Airlines Europe is a stock game, with players earning points for the stock they hold in particular airline companies when one of the randomly determined scorings takes place. On a player's turn, that player either expands an airline and claims a stock, plays stock onto the board and receives dividend, invests in a special airline called Air ABACUS or gets a certain amount of money from the bank. A player scores only for stock in play, but the value of an airline is determined by the value of the route licenses that airline owns  &ndash; thus, you're torn in terms of what to play when.&#10;&#10;Some changes compared to Airlines:&#10;&#10;&#10;     map of Europe&#10;     no flight cards &#10;     special Air ABACUS airline similar to the Union Pacific &#10;     share track system&#10;     separate victory point and money systems&#10;     airplane miniatures&#10;     no sabotage &#10;     up to 5 players&#10;     reduced playtime&#10;&#10;&#10;Some changes compared to Union Pacific:&#10;&#10;&#10;     airplane theme&#10;     map of Europe&#10;     no track cards&#10;     Air ABACUS is acquired by trading in other shares&#10;     share track system &#10;     separate victory point and money systems&#10;     up to 5 players&#10;     reduced playtime &#10;&#10;&#10;Re-implements:&#10;&#10;    Airlines&#10;    Union Pacific&#10;&#10;&#10;Promo Expansions:&#10;&#10;    Airlines Europe: Flight Ban (adding the option to block routes)&#10;    Airlines Europe: New Bonus Connections (adding bonus connections for the black and the brown airline)&#10;    Airlines Europe: The Presidents (adds tie breaker for stock payouts)&#10;&#10;&#10;	\N	2	5	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/MWSJ6c001o3HAk00qek9Rw__original/img/_XPl3-a7ZAkwNH6dyTkKwZnwapo=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic975416.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/MWSJ6c001o3HAk00qek9Rw__thumb/img/ZgcRUnCdSNZZyCnpBBs1ST5ESwE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic975416.jpg
763	133848	Euphoria: Build a Better Dystopia	You find yourself in a dystopian cityscape with a few workers at your disposal to make your mark on the world. Like most people in dystopian fiction, your workers are oblivious to their situation. This world is all they've ever known, and you may use them at your whim.&#10;&#10;The world as we know it has ended, and in its place the city of Euphoria has risen. Believing that a new world order is needed to prevent another apocalypse, the Euphorian elite erect high walls around their golden city and promote intellectual equality above all else. Gone are personal freedoms; gone is knowledge of the past. All that matters is the future.&#10;&#10;The Euphorians aren&rsquo;t alone. Outside the city are those who experienced the apocalypse firsthand&mdash;they have the memories and scars to prove it. These Wastelanders have cobbled together a society of historians and farmers among the forgotten scrap yards of the past.&#10;&#10;There is more to the world than the surface of the earth. Deep underground lies the hidden city of Subterra, occupied by miners, mechanics, and revolutionaries. By keeping their workers in the dark, they&rsquo;ve patched together a network of pipes and sewers, of steam and gears, of hidden passages and secret stairways.&#10;&#10;In Euphoria: Build a Better Dystopia, you lead a team of workers (dice) and recruits (cards) to claim ownership of the dystopian world. You will generate commodities, dig tunnels to infiltrate opposing areas, construct markets, collect artifacts, strengthen allegiances, and fulfill secret agendas.&#10;&#10;Euphoria is a worker-placement game in which dice are your workers. The number on each die represents a worker's knowledge&mdash;that is, his level of awareness that he's in a dystopia. Worker knowledge enables various bonuses and impacts player interaction. If the collective knowledge of all of your available workers gets too high, one of them might desert you. You also have two elite recruit cards at your disposal; one has pledged allegiance to you, but the other needs some convincing. You can reveal and use the reticent recruit by reaching certain milestones in the game... or by letting other players unwittingly reach those milestones for you.&#10;&#10;Your path to victory is paved with the sweat of your workers, the strength of your allegiances, and the tunnels you dig to infiltrate other areas of the world, but the destination is a land grab in the form of area control. You accomplish this by constructing markets that impose harsh restrictions of personal freedoms upon other players, changing the face of the game and opening new paths to victory. You can also focus on gathering artifacts from the old world, objects of leisure that are extremely rare in this utilitarian society. The dystopian elite covet these artifacts&mdash;especially matching pairs&mdash;and are willing to give you tracts of land in exchange for them.&#10;&#10;Four distinct societies, each of them waiting for you to rewrite history. What are you willing to sacrifice to build a better dystopia?&#10;&#10;	\N	2	6	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/aaEdtCTpdlDLTn_tuDuC0g__original/img/6mvmw0I7vDfcKSFg-g9E5F4GEgA=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1615561.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/aaEdtCTpdlDLTn_tuDuC0g__thumb/img/9BsIaNTaCuhQtx806N8Clm1fGO0=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1615561.jpg
764	31730	Wabash Cannonball	Wabash Cannonball, which has also been released as Chicago Express, was the first title in Winsome Games' Historic Railroads System.&#10;&#10;In the game, the B&amp;O, C&amp;O, Pennsylvania and New York Central railroads drive from the East Coast across the growing eastern U.S. to Chicago. Smaller, more aggressive railroads like the Wabash spring up to further expand America's extensive railroads. The sharpest railroad executives vie for the maximum return on their investment in this luck-free business game lasting about one hour.&#10;&#10;The game plays out over a maximum of eight rounds. In each round, players take turns choosing one of three available actions:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Auctioning a share of one of the railroad companies.&#10;     Expanding the rail system of one of the railroad companies.&#10;     Developing one of the board's hexes.&#10;&#10;&#10;Each of these actions is available only a limited number of times. As soon as two actions can no longer be chosen, a dividend phase is executed in which all players gain income from the railroad companies of which they have shares. After this dividend phase, the number of actions is reset, and a new round begins.&#10;&#10;The game ends after eight rounds or if one of the following conditions is met:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Three or more companies have no more locomotives.&#10;     Three or more companies have no more shares.&#10;     The general supply contains at most three houses.&#10;&#10;&#10;At this point, the player with the most money wins.&#10;&#10;Note: Some editions of this game have carried a player count of 2-6, while the 2023 Rio Grande Games edition is labeled for 3-6 players.

Ten years later, Libertalia: Winds of Galecrest celebrates the foundations of the original design with a revised and expanded edition that includes all-new art, 40 characters per player, a reputation system to resolve ties, deluxe loot tokens, a robust solo mode, and much more.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;	\N	1	6	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/6e-V_Xb2IsAsMNXU18Fi6A__original/img/gLDo-RR_9RvU_Hrs9DnHWy_TWpk=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic6669033.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/6e-V_Xb2IsAsMNXU18Fi6A__thumb/img/KJIHXXkkIU7R-oK5i9byIyGdfm4=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6669033.jpg
766	91312	Discworld: Ankh-Morpork	Martin Wallace and Treefrog Games present Ankh-Morpork, set in the largest city-state in Terry Pratchett's Discworld.  Lord Vetinari has disappeared and different factions are trying to take control of the city. Each player has a secret personality with specific victory conditions, which means that you're not sure exactly what the other players need to do in order to win.&#10;&#10;The action takes place on a map of Ankh-Morpork, with players trying to place minions and buildings through card play. Each of the 132 cards is unique, and &quot;the cards bring the game to life as they include most of the famous characters that have appeared in the various books. The rules are relatively simple: Play a card and do what it says. Most cards have more than one action on them, and you can choose to do some or all of these actions. Some cards also allow you to play a second card, so you can chain actions&quot; (Wallace).&#10;&#10;A team of artists have recreated the city and its residents for the cards, game board and box, with Bernard Pearson coordinating that team. Ankh-Morpork has been sublicensed to Mayfair Games for the North American market and Kosmos for the German market.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/oPDDEVveK_Pfrd79cEakRg__original/img/50I_juHmdIIOmKay-2g3Pyemmac=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1062739.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/oPDDEVveK_Pfrd79cEakRg__thumb/img/eVEBMG0eGKr-E0SSPd5TNkvQRkY=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1062739.jpg
767	163968	Elysium	Mythic Greece. As an upstart demigod, you want to earn the favor of the Olympians and become a figure of legend yourself.  Gather heroes and powerful artifacts, please the gods and bear their power to write your own epic tale.&#10;&#10;Let your allies achieve their destiny and enter the Elysium, home of the glorious and the brave. Once the stories are written, only one demigod will be chosen to stand at the side of Zeus.&#10;&#10;Elysium is a game of set collecting and combinations in which players recruit cards representing heroes, items, powers and gods. These cards have many different powers and you can create powerful combination to earn gold (the help of the gods) and victory points (the favor of the gods). Each card belongs to one of the eight Olympians gods (a family), and shows a level (1 to 3).&#10;&#10;During the five turns of the game, players will try to transfer their cards to the Elysium and write their own Legends, which are series of cards from the same family or from different families of the same level. The more epic the Legends, the more favor from the gods they&rsquo;ll earn. But as they go to Elysium, most cards lose their power and players will therefore have to renounce some of their combinations !&#10;&#10;A game of balance and opportunity with  simple action, but constant dilemmas and complex strategies.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/hNyO7u1pR3oSxKTELS7n2w__original/img/rpASlZTyhc7GMnGiMwk1i4AC-PY=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic2837103.png	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/hNyO7u1pR3oSxKTELS7n2w__thumb/img/HWVlTW4WTam1F8UeT6RJeS4olIs=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2837103.png
769	284435	Nova Luna	The new moon is a symbol for a new beginning, the perfect time to start something new and to plan your future &mdash; and that is what Nova Luna (lat. for new moon) is all about. In each round of this abstract tile-laying game, you have to plan your future anew, developing a new strategy to cope with what the moon wheel has to offer you.&#10;&#10;On each turn, you have to decide which new tile from the moon wheel to place in front of you. Every new tile brings a new task you have to fulfill. In order to do so, you need to place tiles of the correct color adjacent to the task you want to complete, but these of course again bring you new tasks. Each time a task is solved, you may place one of your markers on it. So decide wisely and be the first one to place all your markers.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;	\N	1	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/k8OZeKYMN2vVSVCl5FD-UA__original/img/XiytG0d5nHtdoN4Kq3pCM6VcSac=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5382418.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/k8OZeKYMN2vVSVCl5FD-UA__thumb/img/lRMeiFcB9C3ivyZlCoPRQe5xKNU=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5382418.jpg

771	27173	Vikings	Vikings is a fast economic game.  Despite the nominal &quot;Viking&quot; theme, no actual exploration or pillaging is involved.&#10;&#10;The resources in the game consist of coins and several types of ship tiles, island tiles and meeples.   In each of 6 rounds, a random set of 12 tiles and 12 meeples becomes available.  Players take turns buying and placing pairs of meeples and tiles.   There is no direct player interaction, only indirect contention for resources during the buying phase.&#10;&#10;The most unusual aspect of the game is the pricing wheel, which pairs meeples with tiles and sets their prices.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/nQPsaIgIvHiVewkPlSeFLA__original/img/WVqOVRbWwE3skoEB63fy-gHbi1k=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1904581.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/nQPsaIgIvHiVewkPlSeFLA__thumb/img/r-994ljtk8eekrwvCCRWsbnx3PQ=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1904581.jpg

You and your fellow Dukes must recruit citizens and buy domains to build up your kingdoms and slay the foul creatures that lurk in the surrounding lands.&#10;&#10;Valeria: Card Kingdoms is a tableau-building game for 1-5 players and will feel familiar to deck-building fans. The cards you buy can work for you on your turn and on all the other player turns, as well. On your turn, roll two dice and activate citizen cards with the result of each individual die and the sum of both dice. Other players will simultaneously activate their citizen cards based on the roll. Next, take two actions from the following: slay a monster, recruit a citizen, buy a domain, or take 1 of any resource. The player with the most victory points at the end wins the game.&#10;&#10;	\N	1	5	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/WcC51JYkbf9CYjKGgAVQAw__original/img/HNPdp4xIbg_Sl1u1kcS99blEO60=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic6922596.png	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/WcC51JYkbf9CYjKGgAVQAw__thumb/img/Hk5M9-pYZe0XVkXg2FiOaT07EPk=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6922596.png
775	97842	Last Will	In his last will, your rich uncle stated that all of his millions will go to the nephew who can enjoy money the most. How to find out which nephew should be rich? You will each be given a large amount of money and whoever can spend it first will be the rightful heir. Visit the most exclusive theatres or eat in the most expensive restaurants. Buy old properties for the price of new ones and sell them as ruins. Host a huge party in your mansion or on your private boat. Spend like your life would depend on it. Spend to become rich! If you're the first to run through the money on hand, you'll receive the rest of his inheritance &ndash; oh, and win the game.&#10;&#10;In Last Will, each player starts with a certain amount of money, an individual player board, two errand boys and two cards in some combination of properties and helpers. At the start of each round, lay out cards from the appropriate decks on the offering boards; the four regular decks are properties, companions, events, helpers and expenses, with special cards forming a deck of their own. The particular mix of cards varies by round and by the number of players.&#10;&#10;Each player then chooses a plan for the round, with each plan indicating the number of cards the player draws (drawn immediately from the four regular decks in any combination), how many errand boys he can use later (one or two), the number of actions available to him that round, and his spot in the playing order that round. In the playing order for that round, players then take turns choosing an action with their errand boy(s), with those actions being:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Take a card on display and add it to your hand.&#10;    Draw a card from any regular deck &ndash; This can be chosen only once by each player.&#10;    Visit the opera and spend $2.&#10;    Adjust the value modifiers in the property market.&#10;    Take a player board extension, thereby giving you room to play more cards.&#10;&#10;&#10;Players then take actions in the playing order for that round, with each player having as many actions as indicated on his plan. Actions let you play one-time events (which have a cost, possibly variable); helpers and recurring expenses (which are placed on your individual player board); and properties (which cost money and may depreciate over time). You can often play companions with events or recurring expenses &ndash; of course you should bring a date to the opera or a horse on your yacht! &ndash; to increase their cost. You can also use actions to activate cards on your player board, possibly with one or more companions and always with the goal of spending money. Helpers and special cards can provide you with unique powers to further boost your profligacy.&#10;&#10;At the end of each round, you must discard down to two cards in hand, and properties that can depreciate do so; this is good as a player cannot go bankrupt if he owns properties, and the only way to get rid of properties is to sell them, which regretably puts money back in your hands unless the depreciation was intense or you manipulate the market.&#10;&#10;If a player has no money and no properties, he declares bankruptcy and the game ends at the conclusion of that round; otherwise the game ends after seven rounds. The player who has the least money (or even who is most in debt) wins.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	5	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/lJ-yg0oUpHLWI6If6Q-JbA__original/img/c14HvRB3EME-flsZmQRIaJa3Nj4=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2442432.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/lJ-yg0oUpHLWI6If6Q-JbA__thumb/img/mq1zlPHslpjaHqfXlJY_H-ZNF7Q=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2442432.jpg
776	102652	Sentinels of the Multiverse	A mad scientist holds the world hostage with his terrifying inventions. An alien warlord from a far away galaxy brings his limitless army of bizarre minions to conquer the planet. A giant rampaging robot cuts a swath of destruction across the coast, destroying major population centers. And who will stand in their way? A team of heroes, all with impressive powers and abilities stand between the world and the forces of evil. Will you help them? Answer the call to protect the multiverse!&#10;&#10;Sentinels of the Multiverse is a cooperative, fixed-deck card game with a comic book flavor. Each player plays as one of ten heroes, against one of four villains, and the battle takes place in one of four different dynamic environments.&#10;&#10;Each player, after selecting one of the heroes, plays a deck of 40 cards against the villain and environment decks, which &quot;play themselves&quot;, requiring the players to put the top card of the appropriate deck into play on the villain and environment turns. On each player's turn, they may play a card from their hand, use a power printed on one of their cards in play, and draw a card from their deck. Each round starts with the villain turn, continues clockwise around the table, then concludes with the environment turn. Each villain has various advantages, such as starting with certain cards in play, as specified by the villain character card. Play continues until the heroes reduce the villain to 0 or fewer HP, or until the villain defeats the heroes, either via a win condition or by reducing all the heroes to 0 or fewer HP.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	5	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/KQJVwFggx85c6tkq99MW9Q__original/img/6zbLmCIIUoFlK_l5AnIKB7UGsOg=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1296144.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/KQJVwFggx85c6tkq99MW9Q__thumb/img/rts0fENMEytS8E6wJjiZ1bpoThk=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1296144.jpg
777	117959	Las Vegas	Developer Stefan Br&uuml;ck at alea describes Las Vegas as &quot;an easy, dice-rolling, fun-and-luck game with a lot of interaction and 'schadenfreude'&quot;. Who doesn't love schadenfreude? (Well, other than those being schadened, I suppose...)&#10;&#10;In more detail, Las Vegas includes six cardboard casino mats, one for each side of a normal six-sided die. For each mat, players draw money cards until at least $50k is showing, but the amount may end up being a lot more, making that casino more desirable.&#10;&#10;Each player has eight dice of a different color, which they take turns rolling. When you roll your dice, you can choose to place them on the relevant casino cards; for example, a die showing a 1 will be placed on the casino mat marked &quot;1&quot;. You must place all dice of one number on one casino in your turn. All players take turns doing this until all the dice have been used. Finally, the player with the most dice on each casino card takes the money associated with it. In case of a tie, the next non-tied player takes the highest-valued money card at that casino.&#10;&#10;Las Vegas rates a 1 out of 10 on alea's difficulty scale.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	5	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/aQJ0HRKx2mobP0g3FCeR_Q__original/img/0lvxwLBBElto13XPMisB0ZCTSkA=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1261796.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/aQJ0HRKx2mobP0g3FCeR_Q__thumb/img/7g-l6beAu5RtsAykBhoO7kMWexc=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1261796.jpg
778	183251	Karuba	This is a tile-laying race game with players starting with boards that are identical, and one player drawing tiles that they all will use. They race to get their explorers to temples first and earn points. Along the way they can collect additional points by collecting items off the paths they create. The game ends when one player gets all of their explorers to their corresponding temples or whenever the last tile is drawn and placed. Most points wins.&#10;&#10;Description from the English Ruleset:&#10;&#10;Many moons have come and gone since your boats departed on the journey to Karuba. Once you arrive on the island, each player will lead an expedition team of four adventurers. Now you just have to navigate your way through the dense jungle to make it to the temples. &bdquo;Just&ldquo; may be something of an understatement; the ancient jungle trails have to be found and uncovered first! Hurry up and be the first to reach the temples to collect the most valuable treasures. Many paths have dead ends and you need to be patient to find the right/best way (through the jungle). Look! A gold nugget! You can pick it up and collect it, same applies to the shiny crystals along the paths.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/hhV3JiYZUHEi_glLhC0v8w__original/img/CJ-VpizVCicjpKS6Gs5hy9E74LQ=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2727088.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/hhV3JiYZUHEi_glLhC0v8w__thumb/img/_XHxgYraTvLmBnHpY8snFa2ma9o=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2727088.jpg

To win the game, you need to capture and buy locations, recruit new characters, and complete goals; each of these actions gives you victory points at the end of the game. To do so, you need to play cards from your hand (each with a unique set of actions) and combine them. Don't think it's simple! With a good strategy during your turn, you can take up to ten actions in a row.&#10;&#10;You will encounter plenty of mysterious ocean creatures and take them to your hand.

791	475	Taj Mahal	Northwest India at the beginning of the 18th century. The rule of the Grand Moguls is waning, and the Maharishis and princes seize the opportunity to take control of the region. By influencing the prominent forces, building magnificent palaces, and ensuring a steady supply of commodities, the princes increase their power until the most successful has won.&#10;&#10;The goal of the game is to gain the most influence points. These can be obtained by building palaces and by acquiring commodities. A palace can be built after securing the support of the Vizier, the General, the Monk, the Princess, or the Grand Mogul. Commodities are gained by seizing control of a region or by retrieving them on a space where a palace has just been built.&#10;&#10;There are twelve turns with an auction for the region control and the support of the Vizier, General, Monk, Princess, and Grand Mogul, each represented by a different symbol. Players use cards in four colors to bid for the various prizes, and each player may only play one color in any given turn. During your turn you can either increase your bid by playing more cards or withdraw. When you do, you gain the reward for every symbol you have the majority of. You place palaces, gain region tiles, and increase your score accordingly. There are bonus points for connecting palaces over several regions on the map.After the final area on the board is auctioned, the player with the highest point total wins the game.&#10;&#10;This game is #3 in the Alea big box series.&#10;&#10;Note: the 2018 edition from Fantasy Flight Games includes rules for 2 players. You use only the cards included in the game, so no additional components are required.

780	875	Roads & Boats	In Roads &amp; Boats, players start with a modest collection of donkeys, geese, boards, and stone. With these few materials, players work to develop their civilization. The emphasis in the game is logistical transport as you bring goods to producers to make new goods. But beware, the only thing you own is what is on your transporters, and anyone can use any production facility, or pick up any goods left behind.&#10;&#10;In more detail, this massive set of pieces looks more like a modular game kit than anything else. You get a several small hexes in a number of colors for terrain type; hundreds of little counters for the commodities that are produced and the locations where they're produced; wooden disks for all of the donkeys, rafts, trucks, and other forms of transportation you can use; and a roll of acrylic with an erasable marker. The tiles are laid out in whatever scenario you wish to play, and then the clear plastic is taped over the top to secure the entire board. Roads and bridges are drawn on the plastic and chits are placed in the hexes to form the playing surface. The idea is that your transportation units (at first, a fleet of 3 donkeys) travel about and pick items that part produced. However, the only thing that you own is that which is carried by your transports. So you might have a nice, shiny, new truck factory or a gold-filled mine, but anyone can use it or take it, if they collect the necessary components and can transport them to the factory. The ultimate goal is to collect wealth, which is progressively more valuable and harder to manufacture: gold, coins, or stock certificates; and also contribute to the game timer in the form of monument blocks for victory points.&#10;&#10;Third edition (and later) player transporter tokens were upgraded to shaped wooden tokens.&#10;For its 20th Anniversary, Roads &amp; Boats has an edition that contains the &amp;cetera expansion: Roads & Boats: 20th Anniversary Edition&#10;&#10;	\N	1	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/V-uqqRB-Ybm6oD5jWv9cSw__original/img/pOBZTUAqNmdJzkhEuFkxxnaGedk=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic713985.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/V-uqqRB-Ybm6oD5jWv9cSw__thumb/img/mJ6WPCY8ub5LWFnpCnusv42WNhI=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic713985.jpg

Instead, he invites all of his former &quot;colleagues&quot; to join him in his retirement, to enjoy the fruits of their looting with impunity. Each year, in remembrance  of the &quot;good old days,&quot; Morgan organizes the Great Challenge, a race around the island, and at its end, the Captain with the most gold is declared Grand Winner.&#10;&#10;Goal: The game ends on the turn when at least one player's ship reaches the finish line, completing one circuit around the island of Jamaica. At that point, players are awarded different amounts of gold in accordance with how far away from the finish line they were when the race concluded. This gold is added to any gold a player gathered along the way by detouring from the race to search for valuable treasure, by stealing gold or treasure from other players, or just by loading gold as directed by the cards the player played during the race. The player with the most total gold acquired through all these means is then declared the winner.&#10;&#10;Gameplay: The game is played in rounds. Each player always has a hand of three cards, and a personal board depicting the five &quot;holds&quot; of their ship, into which goods can be loaded during the game. Each round, one player is designated as &quot;captain,&quot; with the next clockwise player being captain in the following round, and so on. The captain rolls two standard D6 dice, examines her cards, then announces which die will correspond to the &quot;day&quot; and which to the &quot;night.&quot; Each player then simultaneously selects a card from their hand and places it face down in front of them. Each card has two symbols on it, one on the left - corresponding to &quot;day&quot; - and one on the right (&quot;night&quot;). The symbols indicate either ship movement (forward or backward) or the loading of a type of good. After every player has selected a card, all cards are revealed simultaneously and then resolved clockwise one by one, starting with the captain's. When it is a player's turn to resolve her card, for first the left symbol on her card and then for the right symbol, the player will load a number of goods or move a number of spaces equal to the number of pips showing on the corresponding day or night die for that round. Thus the main decision each player makes during the game is which of their current three cards would best serve them on a particular turn, given the values of the day and night dice.  Finally, during the race, when a player lands on a spot already occupied by another player, there is a battle. Battles are mainly resolved by rolling a &quot;combat&quot; die, but players may improve their chances by using &quot;gunpowder&quot; tokens from their holds, if they loaded any on previous turns. The winner of a battle may steal some goods or treasure from the loser.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	6	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/jZRfv3isrBG5waCzEx60Cw__original/img/aLqKSqw-RWyR4wyfFUywWMQXUTc=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic6434838.png	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/jZRfv3isrBG5waCzEx60Cw__thumb/img/6q5nirF5yn1d0qtjm2UEI5HV874=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6434838.png

784	371942	The White Castle	The heron flies over the Himeji sky while the Daimio, from the top of the castle, watches his servants move. Gardeners tend the pond, where the koi carp live, warriors stand guard on the walls, and courtiers crowd the gates, pining for an audience that brings them closer to the innermost circles of the court. When night falls, the lanterns are lit and the workers return to their clan.&#10;&#10;In The White Castle, players will control one of these clans in order to score more victory points than the rest. To do so, they must amass influence in the court, manage resources boldly, and place their workers in the right place at the right time. The authors are Sheila Santos and Israel Cendrero, the duo known as Llama Dice who also designed the successful The Red Cathedral with Devir. In this case, we leave the Moscow of Ivan the Terrible behind to explore the most imposing fortress in modern Japan, Himeji Castle, where the banner of the Sakai clan flies under the orders of Daimio Sakai Tadakiyo.&#10;&#10;The White Castle is a Euro type game with mechanics of resource management, worker placement and dice placement to carry out actions. During the game, over three rounds, players will send members of their clan to tend the gardens, defend the castle or progress up the social ladder of the nobility. At the end of the match, these will award players victory points in a variety of ways.&#10;&#10;The central panel shows Himeji Castle in all its splendor, divided into several zones. The largest is inside the castle, with the Room of the Thousand Carpets, where the courtiers must ascend socially until they reach the circle closest to the Daimio to enjoy his favor. There is also the pond and the gardens, patiently tended by the gardeners where everyone can relax and contemplate its beauty without restriction. Another important area is the wall and the outside of the castle, where the warriors patrol and stand guard. Finally, we find the area of the three bridges, where the three types of dice that can be used to carry out actions are accumulated, and the personal domain of each player, where they will keep track of their resources and where they will have the reserve of workers.&#10;&#10;With accessible rules and a very careful setting, The White Castle is a very versatile title that will fit in with different gaming groups. As is tradition with Llama Dice titles, its sleek and simple design belies a great deal of strategic depth within the grasp of players.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;	\N	1	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/qXT1U-nFh9PE8ujfdmI7dA__original/img/jzmifZJ0Sg2Js7hmQjzX7bEHVBY=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic7754663.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/qXT1U-nFh9PE8ujfdmI7dA__thumb/img/ru1l95gdKNXSsByDglE9Xxgu0kE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7754663.jpg
785	123123	BattleCON: Devastation of Indines	As new villains appear to lay claim to the world of Indines, new heroes rise to challenge them. BattleCON: Devastation of Indines puts you in control of 30 mighty heroes and deadly villains to decide the fate of the world.&#10;&#10;BattleCON: Devastation of Indines is a standalone dueling card game designed for head-to-head and team play. Each player selects a character who uses a unique gameplay mechanism to give them an edge in combat. Take control of guitar-playing summoner, a pair of tag-teaming werewolves, a prodigal paladin, a genius artificer, and more! Each character's play style requires new strategies, but uses the same foundational tactics, making a new character easy to learn, but challenging to master.&#10;&#10;Players move along a seven-space-long board, trading blows and attempting to strike the opponent, using attacks formed by combining a character's unique styles and abilities with a set of basic cards that all characters share. The last player standing wins!&#10;&#10;BattleCON: Devastation of Indines can be played on its own or combined with BattleCON: War of Indines to create an even greater pool of characters and play variants.&#10;&#10;Included with the game:  BattleQUEST Guide&#10;&#10;The BattleQUEST Dungeon Guide contains six adventures (3 solo and 3 cooperative) for players. Using BattleQUEST, players can play alone or cooperatively against automated enemies in an attempt to defeat the final boss and claim victory!&#10;&#10;	\N	1	5	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/fHaLlnlbJPo52qAOYaY4Yw__original/img/wJdi0UGLHvS3IVYK_MFjFlSNE4w=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2407334.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/fHaLlnlbJPo52qAOYaY4Yw__thumb/img/CK7EehPmHRP9brSWaj6plslTeRs=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2407334.jpg
786	265402	In the Hall of the Mountain King	Play as trolls rebuilding your abandoned kingdom under the mountain in In the Hall of the Mountain King. With muscle and magic, you'll unearth riches, dig out collapsed tunnels, and carve out great halls as you raise the toppled statues of your ancestors to their places of honor at the heart of the mountain. Gameplay is driven by the innovative cascading production system. Timing and tactics are key as you work to restore your home to its former glory and win the crown!&#10;&#10;Working on the same game board with the other players (but beginning at your own entrance), you'll dig a competing network of tunnels by spending increasingly valuable materials to lay polyomino tiles onto the map. You want to extend your tunnels to connect with buried gold and materials, with workshop locations that can transform resources, and especially with toppled statues. Statues are key to scoring, and you'll spend carts to move them through the tunnels to prime scoring locations near the heart of the mountain.&#10;&#10;A major aspect of the game is the cascading production. You begin with a line of four trolls, and every troll shows the combination of resources &mdash; gold, stone, iron, marble, carts, runes, and hammers &mdash; that it produces. When a new troll is hired, place it above two other trolls, forming a &quot;pyramid&quot;. The new troll activates, gaining its resources, and any trolls beneath it ALSO activate, gaining any resources that they have room to carry. In this way as you hire more trolls, you gain bigger and bigger windfalls of resources as the end of the game nears. The timing of your hiring turns versus your building turns is important as you try to maximize your cascades while making sure you get the trolls you want from the shared market and also stay competitive on the map.&#10;&#10;The game ends shortly after the last player hires their sixth troll, then the player with the most honor (earned for digging tunnels of increasing quality, for excavating great halls, and for moving statues closer to the heart of the mountain, especially onto matching pedestals) is crowned the Mountain King and wins!&#10;&#10;	\N	2	5	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/O85rGsVqqTfrFbcHQCIFHg__original/img/DhTYEiUShjAY599TQ9yQaJxpu9I=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4421569.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/O85rGsVqqTfrFbcHQCIFHg__thumb/img/td7Xjx0NMeSUrBVm4fBoIweCxjA=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4421569.jpg
787	22827	StarCraft: The Board Game	Publisher blurb&#10;&#10;Including a total of 180 plastic figures and dozens of unit types, Starcraft: The Board Game features an innovative modular board of varying sizes, which guarantees a new experience each and every game. An exciting card driven combat system allows players to modify and upgrade their faction with a wealth of powerful technologies. Players can unleash a Zergling rush, use powerful Protoss shields to halt an enemy invasion, or even send cloaked Ghosts out to guide nuclear missiles to their target.&#10;&#10;Description&#10;&#10;In StarCraft: The Board Game, players battle for galactic domination on a dynamic board of interconnected planets. Planetary setup is already part of the game - every player gets two planets to place, and will place their starting base on one of them. Planets are connected with direct and &quot;Z-Axis&quot; connections that are placed during setup, but can sometimes later be modified during the game, and movement is only possible within planets and through those connections (by means of purpose-built transports).&#10;&#10;Each player controls a faction out of six, that belongs to one race out of three - Humans, Zerg, and Protoss. Each faction has a unique special victory condition, but all factions can also win through victory points that are gained by controlling special areas on some of the planets. Players build units and base upgrades with the resources they gather from the planetary areas that they control, and gain access to additional unit types through those upgrades.&#10;&#10;Each turn is subdivided into first a planning phase, then an execution phase, and finally a regrouping phase (used for cleanup). In the planning phase, players take turns playing a number of order tokens into stacks on each planet, with orders placed later obstructing the ones that were placed before them. This allows players to set up combos of their own, but also to obstruct plans of other players. In the execution phase then, players take turns again, and when a player's turn comes up he can choose one of his order tokens on top of any stack and execute that one - if all of their orders are obstructed, they skip their action and draw an event card instead. The execution phase isn't over until all players executed all of their orders. Possible orders are Build (used for building both units and buildings), Mobilize (used for moving units and attacking enemies) and Research (see below), and orders can always be Standard Orders or Special Orders, with the special orders having prerequisites but stronger effects.&#10;&#10;Players can also research new technologies and thus improve their combat deck in a precursor to more recent deck building mechanisms. Each player is given a combat deck unique for their race at the start of the game, and when they research new technologies then matching cards are added to that deck. This allows the players to customize what cards they will draw; when the last card of the deck is drawn, the deck is reshuffled. Most cards remain in the combat deck once researched, though some researched technologies add effects that are always in play, while some particularly strong combat cards are discarded after one use.&#10;&#10;&quot;Reimplements&quot;&#10;&#10;     StarCraft (video game)&#10;&#10;&#10;	\N	2	6	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/tXwlK5uyyxaMzXG65NZ3Xg__original/img/J5-KA7kHSx-6ln75ntNNy9OeBwA=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic265704.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/tXwlK5uyyxaMzXG65NZ3Xg__thumb/img/-93qv9jIN6Lx9DZUCg9W8i-t6P8=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic265704.jpg
788	280794	Etherfields	Etherfields is a narrative, cooperative game for 1 - 4 (5 with the 5th player expansion). A series of unique Dreams await to be discovered through tense exploration and tactical encounters.&#10;&#10;Learn about the Dreamers, their forgotten past, and their desperate mission. Uncover the surreal, sprawling dreamscapes. Just don't be surprised when---just like dreams often do---they become a little disturbing... Prepare to be challenged by escape-room like riddles. Spot a clue in the image. See a hidden link between several pieces of information. Use your instinct as much as your logic.&#10;&#10;In the beginning, you'll explore the Dreamworld, trying to find out what this is all about and who you are &ndash; and you are there for a specific reason, but, at first, you can't remember too much. You'll have to restore your memories from scattered pieces.&#10;&#10;The rules are pretty straightforward at the beginning, but they will grow more and more complex during the campaign. New rules open new possibilities and, sometimes, may turn everything upside down.&#10;&#10;Deckbuilding in Etherfields applies to almost every deck in the game, not only the players' ones. If you want to know more, enter the Dreamworld. It may be dark here and there, but it certainly isn't gray. Then, look around and ask yourself: what if we all live in a vast, shared dream?&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;	\N	1	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/K1yVmbbWCsQuiWk-7x-V-Q__original/img/4l1YMMVL91dNV8KU9cAGADUBY68=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic7455627.png	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/K1yVmbbWCsQuiWk-7x-V-Q__thumb/img/AfTJAQPJAcIWxK-w2-GExwmsTmA=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7455627.png
789	248490	Atlantis Rising (Second Edition)	The isle of Atlantis, your home, is sinking. Will you be able to save your people in time?&#10;&#10;Atlantis Rising is a co-operative worker placement game in which you must work together with up to six other players to deploy citizens across your homeland, gathering resources in order to build a cosmic gate that can save your people. Workers placed close to the shoreline are more rewarding, but are more likely to be flooded and the actions lost.&#10;&#10;Every turn, each player draws a misfortune card that will flood certain locations along the ever-shrinking Atlantis shoreline, or may otherwise work to undermine your efforts to save your people. So you must race to gather the necessary resources to build and power the gate, before the island disappears beneath the waves forever.&#10;&#10;This edition contains all new art and graphic design, created to bring even more attention to the thematic setting of the game. The Athenians Attack phase has been replaced with the Wrath of the Gods phase, requiring more strategic planning and adding to the sense of urgency. Now, instead of placing workers in an Atlantean Navy, players must cooperatively decide to flood a set number of tiles at the end of each round. To further aid them in their task, Councilor player powers have been expanded and made more impactful, and the knowledge deck has similarly been revised and expanded. The variable gate components, once built, no longer offer one-time bonuses, but create new worker placement spots where players can send Atlantean workers to unleash actions to help save their island.&#10;&#10;	\N	1	7	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/WRHngbJkWiKAJ4U8xSySIQ__original/img/TXo07OaiWGK59Zu0IBXbnBpbmag=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4895878.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/WRHngbJkWiKAJ4U8xSySIQ__thumb/img/kZ9kSXPe8naMaTtc9IV4SFOBCcw=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4895878.jpg
790	84419	Space Empires 4X	Space Empires is a game in the finest tradition of 4X space games - eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, and eXterminate.  Each player builds up a space empire and uses it to conquer the other players.  Exploration on the mounted map is simple for players (and dangerous for their ships), revealing different space terrain that affects movement and combat.&#10;&#10;Space Empires was developed to keep a rich theme without overcomplicated rules.  The game includes carriers and fighters, mines, cloaking, a very large technology tree, fifteen ship classes, merchant shipping, colonization, mining, terraforming, bases, shipyards, black holes, warp points, and non-player aliens.  Yet the rules are short and intuitive:  The basic rules are 8 pages long and increase to 11 pages in length when the advanced rules are included.&#10;&#10;	\N	1	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/tMPL9ySUdJvhMc8qhIvHdQ__original/img/naqrOuPy757n2OFQ0sYJy9e98Pk=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic6439163.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/tMPL9ySUdJvhMc8qhIvHdQ__thumb/img/dR67zPkJMkELpt7KEzjlMIDR4NA=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6439163.jpg
792	58421	Egizia	The players are builders in Ancient Egypt, competing to get the most fame building different monuments requested by the Pharaoh (the Sphinx, the Obelisk, the Temple, and the Pyramid).&#10;&#10;The game lasts 5 turns. In each turn, the players place their pawns on the board, along the banks of the Nile, getting the advantages shown on each square. On the right bank there are fixed squares where the players may get workers, improve their mercantile capabilities, influence the floods (and thus the fertility of the fields) and reserve the right to build the monuments (that are built only after all the placements are done). On the left bank the players may take cards that are deployed randomly on the 10 squares at the start of each turn; some of these cards are kept until the end of the game (cultivable fields, stone quarries, deities granting special advantages), while others are discarded after the use and offer multiple immediate advantages.&#10;&#10;In Egizia, the twist on the worker placement mechanic is that the players must place their pawns following the course of the Nile, moving northwards (from the top to the bottom of the board, that is seen from the Mediterranean Sea). In this way, each placement not only blocks the opponents from choosing the same square (except monuments, where multiple players are always allowed), but also forces the player to place his remaining pawns only on the squares below the one he just occupied (note that &quot;pawns&quot; are placed, since &quot;workers&quot; are one of the resources of the game, like grain and stones).&#10;&#10;When the placement phase is over, the workers of the players must be fed with the grain produced in the fields. The production of each field is based on the floods of the Nile, so some fields may not give grain each turn. If a player has not enough grain for all his workers, he has to buy it with Victory Points (the ratio is better for players with improved mercantile capabilities, recorded on a specific track on the board).&#10;&#10;After that, stones are received from the owned quarries and used to build the monuments (if the right to do was reserved earlier) along with the workers.&#10;&#10;When the game ends, the points scored during the game (mainly building the monuments) are added to the bonuses obtained fulfilling certain conditions on the Sphinx cards. Whoever has the highest total is the winner.&#10;&#10;Online Play&#10;&#10;&#10;     Yucata (turn-based)&#10;&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/lt07T2HIr_r7JerYdW0iyA__original/img/d8zivAydrkxYBwwXi1XeM73XlIU=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1651950.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/lt07T2HIr_r7JerYdW0iyA__thumb/img/sfnHUziRZl-kItnnr-QFfocySck=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1651950.jpg

794	42052	Vinhos	Vinhos (Portuguese word for &quot;wines&quot;) is a trading and economic game about wine making.&#10;&#10;Despite its small size, Portugal is one of the world&rsquo;s leading wine producers. Why not get to know the country around a table?   Over six years of harvests, cultivate your vines, choose the best varieties, hire the best oenologists, take part in trade fairs, and show your opponents you are the best winemaker in the game.&#10;&#10;The players, winemakers in Portugal, will develop their vineyards and produce wine to achieve maximum profit.&#10;The object of the game is to produce quality wines that can be exchanged for money or victory points.&#10;The best wines are then sent to a wine fair in order to achieve fame and win awards.&#10;&#10;Awake your senses and have fun making and selling your own wine.&#10;&#10;From back of Box Cover:&#10;&#10;In Vinhos (a Portuguese word meaning &ldquo;Wines&rdquo;) you will play the role of wine producers in Portugal.&#10;&#10;Over a period of 6 years, you will expand your business by establishing Estates in the different regions of Portugal, buying vineyards and building wineries. Skilled enologists will help you increase the quality of your wine, while top Wine Experts will enhance its features at the &quot;Feira Nacional do Vinho Portugu&ecirc;s&quot;, the Wine Tasting Fair.&#10;&#10;Selling your wines to Portuguese local hangouts will establish a market presence for your company, help you secure the funds to expand your company, and to pay your enologists&rsquo; salaries.&#10;&#10;But, as everyone knows, prestige cannot come from money alone. To ensure a good reputation on international markets you must meet the requirements of various Countries, by consistently exporting high-quality wines.&#10;&#10;Periodically, a Wine Tasting Fair will be held. It is up to you to decide the best time to announce which wine you intend to present.

795	266830	QE	Financial crisis has occurred. Sixteen &quot;too big to fail&quot; companies from four countries need bailing out. The central banks have unlimited financial resources, so lots of money is going to be printed, but the central banks also face disaster &mdash; print too much money and the country they represent goes bust.&#10;&#10;In Q.E., a term that stands for &quot;quantitative easing&quot;, you play the role of a central bank. You bid on different size companies to accumulate various levels of victory points. The amount you bid is unlimited since you are the central bank and you own the printing press! After the initial &quot;open&quot; bid by the lead player, the other players bid in secret. After the sixteen companies have been &quot;bailed out&quot;, bonus victory points are awarded for company sets of nationalization, monopolization, and diversification.&#10;&#10;Player markers on the scoring track now reveal which player has the most victory points, but this is not the end. Players must now add up the amount of money they printed and the player who printed the most money loses all their victory points!&#10;&#10;Previous editions of Q.E. supported up to four players, with a fifth-player expansion being available separately.

801	2346	DVONN	DVONN is played on an elongated hexagonal board, with 23 white, 23 black and 3 red DVONN-pieces. In the beginning the board is empty. The players place the pieces on empty spaces of the board, without restrictions. They place the DVONN-pieces first and their own pieces next. Then they start stacking pieces on top of each other. A single piece may be moved 1 space in any direction, a stack of two pieces may be moved two spaces, etc. A stack must always be moved as a whole and a move must always end on top of another piece or stack. If pieces or stacks lose contact with the DVONN-pieces, they must be removed from the board. The game ends when no more moves can be made. The players put the stacks they control on top of each other and the one with the highest stack is the winner.&#10;&#10;This game is part of project GIPF.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	2	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/A-6gi-KVQ4ShlhgXU3dRwg__original/img/RLTB6n_kOLYLCGQ-sY1Na3hqUqE=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3324136.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/A-6gi-KVQ4ShlhgXU3dRwg__thumb/img/_ZK7GthCCZu1yH-XPvGbMUoBjfk=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3324136.jpg
796	133038	Pathfinder Adventure Card Game: Rise of the Runelords – Base Set	A forgotten evil stirs in the ancient land of Varisia. Dark magic once more thrums amid crumbling ruins, giants gather in titanic armies, cultists murder in the name of foul deities, and maniacal goblins plot a fiery end for the peaceful town of Sandpoint.&#10;&#10;Launch a campaign to strike back against the evils plaguing Varisia with the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game: Rise of the Runelords - Base Set. This complete cooperative strategy card game pits 1 to 4 heroes against the traps, monsters, deadly magic, and despicable foes of the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game's award-winning Rise of the Runelords Adventure Path. In this game players take the part of a fantasy character such as a rogue or wizard, each with varying skills and proficiencies that are represented by the cards in their deck. The classic ability scores (Strength, Dexterity, etc.) are assigned with different sized dice. Players can acquire allies, spells, weapons, and other items. The goal is to find and defeat a villain before a certain number of turns pass, with the villain being represented by its own deck of cards complete with challenges and foes that must be overcome. Characters grow stronger after each game, adding unique gear and awesome magic to their decks, and gaining incredible powers, all of which they'll need to challenge greater threats in a complete Pathfinder Adventure Card Game Adventure Path.&#10;&#10;The Pathfinder Adventure Card Game is an expandable game, with the first set containing nearly 500 cards. The Rise of the Runelords - Base Set supports 1 to 4 players; a 110-card Character Add-On Deck expands the possible number of players to 5 or 6 and adds more character options for any number of players. The game will be expanded with bimonthly 110-card adventure decks.&#10;&#10;Errata: Early printings had the Loot card &quot;Sihedron Medallion&quot; listed as belonging to &quot;B&quot;  (for Base Set). It is instead supposed to read &quot;1&quot; (for Burnt Offerings ). (It is unknown if this has been fixed in later printings)&#10;&#10;	\N	1	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/oilW_2LuTedEdM0R2y3_MA__original/img/mI00RqJFHhbrh_YmlimWaXCgjJM=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1775517.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/oilW_2LuTedEdM0R2y3_MA__thumb/img/jmxTLSPA-ZE_cNJja4xmQNpT2kA=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1775517.jpg
797	151022	Baseball Highlights: 2045	American baseball was on its last legs as a spectator sport. Football had become the predominant national pastime &mdash; that is until the year 2032, the year baseball decided to revolutionize the game and regain the throne!&#10;&#10;Starting in 2032, baseball games were shortened to six innings. Pitchers were encouraged to have bionic arm implants to improve their pitching. These cyborgs, or 'Borgs as they're affectionately known, were immediately popular and soon ruled the league. In 2041, robotic players were introduced to get more offense back into the game. These robots were similar to designated hitters in that they were used only to bat and did not field. However, recent reports indicate fielding 'Bots are on the way.&#10;&#10;Now in 2045, human players are still in the game and known as Naturals. They are the best fielders by far but are sorely challenged when it comes to hitting and pitching. Some Naturals have learned to hit by swinging before the pitcher starts his windup, which gives them a chance to hit the ball. Although it's hard for a Natural to get into the league, those who do are popular. Many Naturals have named themselves after the great players of pre-2032 baseball by taking a first and last name borrowed from different star players of the past. The fans love them, and their presence on the team ensures good revenue!&#10;&#10;The stage is now set! The fans are energized and root fanatically for their new favorites, be they 'Bots, 'Borgs or Naturals!&#10;&#10;Baseball Highlights: 2045 is like watching TV&nbsp;highlights of early 21st-century baseball games, with the gameplay being full of theme with no outs or innings and without bogging down in a play-by-play baseball simulation. In this quick and interactive game, two players build their teams as they play, combining both strategy (building your team) and tactics (playing the game) without any of the downtime. During each &quot;mini-game&quot;, each player alternates playing six cards to simulate a full game's highlights. The mini-game includes defensive and offensive actions, and your single card play may include elements of defensive and/or offensive plays. Do you try to thwart your opponent's pending hits, put up strong offensive action of your own, or use your better players to do both? Players buy new free agents after each mini-game to improve their roster, and the team who wins the most mini-games in the series is the champ!&#10;&#10;	\N	1	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/6vlkpViMExKmOvg0CoFXPQ__original/img/96tdeLmdw7kqByX2G8Iumao4W6g=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic2262580.png	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/6vlkpViMExKmOvg0CoFXPQ__thumb/img/TdXVmtyO0XebtWfMXsU7hE8hCHY=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2262580.png
798	503	Through the Desert	Each player attempts to score the most points by snaking caravan routes through the desert, trying to reach oases and blocking off sections of the desert. Many people feel that it is reminiscent of Go.&#10;&#10;Publisher's Description&#10;From the award-winning game designer Reiner Knizia comes a game of strategy, patience, and cool plastic camels! The desert is still treacherous, mysterious, and without mercy. But for those willing to risk the dangers of the shifting, sun-baked sands, the desert holds riches beyond compare.&#10; In Through the Desert, two to five players each control a tribe of nomads vying for control of the desert. By establishing caravans and taking over oases, the players gain points as their tribes increase in power.&#10; Strategy is essential in deciding how and where to build your tribe's caravans. There are multiple ways to gain points and several ways to win. Should you try to build the longest caravan? Or should you dominate the desert's oases? Don't forget to keep an eye on your opponents' caravans, or you may find your own tribe cut off from valuable water holes.&#10;&#10;Through the Desert is part of the so called Knizia tile-laying trilogy.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	5	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Rq_hJIAO7jDgIpAW943hJA__original/img/9lIQGNwBYmAlsgXOI6Iw2Q2CIkA=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic7697747.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Rq_hJIAO7jDgIpAW943hJA__thumb/img/blKEV5US-j7v3VDceGF1CIUb-lE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7697747.jpg
799	27746	Colosseum	In Colosseum each player is a Roman impresario - producing great spectacles in his or her arena in the hopes of attracting the most spectators. Players earn wealth and glory for each event run, using it to create ever more ambitious events. They will need to improve their arena, find the best performers, lure the Emperor and his nobles, and manage assets for long-term success to be granted the title of Grand Impresario, with tales of your extraordinary spectacles acclaimed throughout the empire.&#10;&#10;As commanded by the Emperor, the greatest celebration in Roman history has continued unabated for 99 days. All of Rome has borne witness to the grandest spectacles the empire has ever seen&mdash; all to commemorate the opening of the Amphitheatrum Flavium, the Colosseum.&#10;&#10;Tens of thousands have flocked to the city to experience the sight of a hundred gladiators in battle...rare and exotic animals prowling the arena floor...and to hear and see the greatest musicians and entertainers from throughout the empire. But these events have only been a prelude to today &mdash; the closing finale! As a master impresario you have prepared for this moment your entire life.

800	128780	Pax Porfiriana	Pax Porfiriana &ndash; Latin for &quot;The Porfirian Peace&quot; &ndash; refers to the 33-year reign of dictator Porfirio D&iacute;az, who ruled Mexico with an iron hand until toppled by the 1910 Revolution.&#10;&#10;As a rich businessman (Hacendado) in the turbulent pre-revolutionary borderlands of the U.S. and Mexico, players compete to build business empires of ranches, mines, rails, troops, and banks while subverting opponents with bandidos, Indians, and lawsuits. Each turn goes as follows:&#10;&#10;1. Action Phase: Perform three actions, such as play new cards, get new cards from the market, speculate on cards in the market, buy land, or redeploy troops.&#10;2. Discard Headlines: Remove any Headlines (i.e. cards with the Bull-Bear icon) that have reached the leftmost position in the Market.&#10;3. Restore Market: Restore the Market to twelve cards.&#10;4. Income Phase: Collect one gold per Income, Extortion, and Connection Cube in play. If Depression, pay one gold for each card in play (includes Partners and Enterprises in your Row, and all of your Troops).&#10;&#10;Four &quot;scoring&quot; cards (Toppling) are in the game and their effect depends on the current form of government. The government can change if troops are played and as a result of other cards. The form of government also influences different production values of the game, such as how much mines produce. Players win by toppling D&iacute;az, either by coup, succession, revolution, or annexation of Mexico by the U.S. If D&iacute;az remains firmly seated at the end of the game, then the player with the most gold wins.&#10;&#10;Pax Porfiriana includes 220 cards, but only fifty cards (along with ten for each player) are used in a game, so no two games will be the same!&#10;&#10;	\N	1	6	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/eSfBPvoLiAKvCMBzovAnIA__original/img/oq_DUQ2vnasvyq_ir-kZ824oEHc=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1395308.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/eSfBPvoLiAKvCMBzovAnIA__thumb/img/jThYRlCnbZ72LjL412mxYwQ3Q0A=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1395308.jpg

803	169654	Deep Sea Adventure	A group of poor explorers hoping to get rich quickly heads out to recover treasures from some undersea ruins. They're all rivals, but their budgets force them all to share a single rented submarine. In the rented submarine, they all have to share a single tank of air, as well. If they don't get back to the sub before they run out of air, they'll drop all their treasure. Now it's time to see who can bring home the greatest riches.&#10;&#10;Game Objective&#10;The game takes place over 3 rounds, and the player to gain the most points over the 3 rounds is the winner. In order to gain points, you must bring the most ruins chips back to the submarine. You can only return to the submarine once per round, and you cannot progress more after returning. You cannot return to the submarine without bringing any ruins chips.&#10;&#10;Turn Progression&#10;On their turns, players conduct steps 1-4 listed below. Players take turns, going clockwise around the board, and the round ends when all players have returned to the submarine, or if the air runs out at the beginning of someone's turn.&#10;&#10;1) Declare if you will turn back or not.&#10;2) Reduce air.&#10;3) Roll the dice and advance your game piece.&#10;4) Search.

804	156943	Saint Petersburg (Second Edition)	In 1703, Czar Peter the Great founded Saint Petersburg in Russia, which quickly earned the nickname &quot;Paris of the East.&quot; The Winter Palace, the Hermitage, the Church of the Resurrection of Jesus Christ, and many other buildings still amaze visitors from around the world today. To accomplish this, he needed a new administration and brought the aristocrats under his control. This was also a golden time for the workers as their skills were much needed to reform and build the new Russia.&#10;&#10;In Saint Petersburg, players play important roles in building the city of Saint Petersburg. To do this, they will take turns selecting and purchasing cards from the display of available workers, buildings and nobles. Each type of card has an associated phase, and at the end of each phase, players earn rubles and score victory points based on the cards they have collected of that type. When one of the decks runs out, the players play until the end of that round, then the game is over. Additional victory points are awarded at the end of the game depending on the number of unique nobles that each player has, and the player with the most victory points wins the game.&#10;&#10;This new edition of Saint Petersburg features an additional optional module, the Market, which adds a new card type, the market cards, and a new Market phase with its own rules for scoring points. These cards bring in new resources and not only allow for new tactical opportunities, as having a majority in  provides extra victory points during the market phase scoring, but also allow for a fifth player to join the game. This edition also includes the two expansion modules from the original edition plus four entirely new modules, that can be used on their own or mixed and matched as players like.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	5	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/1fEewarXkwjdLINUsUym3Q__original/img/hUuXRIR63LVDT6gtVQH_93aPNxI=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic2298046.png	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/1fEewarXkwjdLINUsUym3Q__thumb/img/N5CrTUi0Bq9rsHTztbMwB3NfWMo=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2298046.png
805	201825	Ex Libris	In Ex Libris, you are a collector of rare and valuable books in a thriving gnomish village. Recently, the Mayor and Village Council have announced an opening for a Grand Librarian: a prestigious (and lucrative) position they intend to award to the most qualified villager! Unfortunately, several of your book collector colleagues (more like acquaintances, really) are also candidates.&#10;&#10;To outshine your competition, you need to expand your personal library by sending your trusty assistants out into the village to find the most impressive tomes. Sources for the finest books are scarce, so you need to beat your opponents to them when they pop up.&#10;&#10;You have only a week before the Mayor's Official Inspector comes to judge your library, so be sure your assistants have all your books shelved! The Inspector is a tough cookie and will use her Official Checklist to grade your library on several criteria including shelf stability, alphabetical order, and variety &mdash; and don't think she'll turn a blind eye to books the Council has banned! You need shrewd planning and cunning tactics (and perhaps a little magic) to surpass your opponents and become Grand Librarian!&#10;&#10;	\N	1	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/DYOUITVYzZEC45u4suwezQ__original/img/GTzMk2LzB3H2xu9tn8nX3Nh9528=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic3578008.png	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/DYOUITVYzZEC45u4suwezQ__thumb/img/27aO3vgzM7MwAPSiKLpehEpAsVI=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3578008.png

Take on the role of a colonial power seeking fame, glory, and riches in the New World. As you proceed through three ages, you launch expeditions of discovery, colonize regions, expand your merchant fleet, build capital buildings that give your nation distinct advantages, develop your economy, and (if necessary) declare war.&#10;&#10;Empires: Age of Discovery is a reimplementation of Age of Empires III but without that name due to the expense of renewing the license from Microsoft.

807	2453	Blokus	Blokus (officially pronounced &quot;Block us&quot;) is an abstract strategy game with transparent, Tetris-shaped, colored pieces that players are trying to play onto the board.  The only caveat to placing a piece is that it may not lie adjacent to your other pieces, but instead must be placed touching at least one corner of your pieces already on the board.&#10;&#10;There is a solitaire variation where one player tries to get rid of all the pieces in a single sitting.&#10;&#10;Goal of the Game:&#10;&#10;Each player has to fit as many of his/her 21 pieces on the board as possible.&#10;&#10;Components:&#10;Blokus Game Board (400 squares)&#10;84 game pieces (four 21-piece sets of red, green, blue, and yellow)&#10;Each color inlcudes:&#10;&#10;     1 one-square piece&#10;     1 piece with 2 squares&#10;     2 pieces with 3 squares&#10;     5 pieces with 4 squares&#10;     12 pieces with 5 squares&#10;&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/96YA5wUJDxtPkmPxemr5Qg__original/img/sdX6o0TZpXjsDMw071k2P80wpYw=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2197702.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/96YA5wUJDxtPkmPxemr5Qg__thumb/img/EBt2y7Awj5djyo185R7g6FV3P9g=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2197702.jpg
809	2163	Space Hulk	Space Hulk is a light miniatures wargame set in the Warhammer 40K universe.  It has a relatively simple rule-set (compared to Warhammer 40K itself) and is known for its fast play and immersive theme (think the movie Aliens).&#10;&#10;You lay out corridors and rooms that represent a space hulk, a large disabled ship floating in space. The Space Marines wear powerful space battle suits and carry heavy weaponry. The Genestealers (reminiscent of the alien in Alien) are naked, except for their quick movement, multiple clawed arms capable of ripping through Terminator armor and their seemingly endless numbers.&#10;&#10;Each game is played as a scenario.  The Space Marines win by completing a certain goal, such as retrieving an artifact and escaping alive.  The Genestealers win by stopping the Space Marines from achieving their goal, usually by killing them all. A unique mechanism is that the Genestealers have no time limit for their turn, but the Space Marines have a 3 minute time limit, and less if a sergeant is killed. This simulates the fact that Genestealers move so much quicker and adds a lot of tension to the game for the Marine player.&#10;&#10;The miniatures are excellent although you do have to paint them yourselves and the modular board is very well done.&#10;&#10;The Deathwing Expansion adds new personnel, weapons, rules for multilevel hulks, new missions and a mission generator along with some complexity.&#10;&#10;The Genestealer Expansion adds new marines, weapons, Genestealer Hybrids who can use weapons and new missions. There are also rules for psychic powers.&#10;&#10;There was also the Space Hulk Campaign Book  that can be linked for longer games. This book also added rules for traitor Marines and new weapons.&#10;&#10;Even with all rules in place the game does not get too complicated and is a very good introduction to Warhammer 40K.&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;Space Hulk (2nd Edition)&#10;Space Hulk (3rd Edition)&#10;Space Hulk (4th Edition)&#10;&#10;	\N	2	2	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/XgVrr2ImtAlnQylHdrzlQg__original/img/zU6CTU_mCv4WsEdXslBks8opfb4=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1411446.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/XgVrr2ImtAlnQylHdrzlQg__thumb/img/u_51bjTXk4fpCstKagB93POGjPk=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1411446.jpg

You must position your plants so that they are provided the most suitable light conditions and take care of them to create the most verdant collection.&#10;&#10;Each turn, you select an adjacent pair of a card and token, then use those items to build an ever-expanding tableau of cards that represents your home. You need to keep various objectives in mind as you attempt to increase plant verdancy by making spatial matches and using item tokens to take various nurture actions. You can also build your &quot;green thumb&quot; skills, which allows you to take additional actions to care for your plants and create the coziest space!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;	\N	1	5	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/c1XGn5ryzbqgMOHzObZpQw__original/img/RWppBKjLU5v6Pl-uW6IIxkCD4U4=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic6094080.png	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/c1XGn5ryzbqgMOHzObZpQw__thumb/img/QJq-vJsWq6D0DMrDFVno-0Lu00o=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6094080.png
812	347703	First Rat	For generations, the rats in the old junkyard have been telling each other the great legend about a moon made out of cheese and they want nothing more than to reach this inexhaustible treasure. One day, the little rat children discovered a comic in the junkyard that described the first landing on the moon, and thus the plan was born: Build a rocket and take over the cheese moon!&#10;&#10;Fortunately, the junkyard has everything the rats need to build their rocket, and the other animals are willing to support this daring venture &mdash; at least if they're well paid. Of course, all the rats work together to achieve this mighty goal. However, each rat family competes to build the most rocket parts and to train the most rattronauts so they can feast on as much of the lunar cheese as possible.&#10;&#10;In First Rat, each player starts with two rats and may raise two more. On your turn, you either move one of your rats 1-5 spaces on the path or move 2-4 of your rats 1-3 spaces each as long as they end up on spaces of the same color. Your rats can never share the same space, and if you land in a space with another player's rat, you must pay them one cheese, borrowing cheese from the back as needed. After movement, you collect resources (cheese, tin cans, apple cores, baking soda, etc.) matching the color of the space you occupy or move your lightbulb along the light string, which will boost your income in future turns. (More lights in the junkyard makes it easier for you to find things!)&#10;&#10;If you end movement near a store, you can spend resources to buy a backpack or bottle top &mdash; or you can steal an item instead, with the rat then returning to the start of the movement track. You can also spend resources to build rocket sections (and score points) or spend cheese in bulk as a donation (and score points).&#10;&#10;When you pick up apple cores, you move around the rat burrow to pick up comics or stored food or raise one of your rats from the nursery. Alternatively, you automatically get a new rat when one of your rats reaches the launch pad and boards the spaceship.

814	266164	Babylonia	The Neo-Babylonian empire, especially under the reign of Nebuchadnezzar II (605-562 B.C.), was a period of rebirth for southern Mesopotamia. Irrigation systems improved and expanded, increasing agricultural production. Urban life flourished with the creation of new cities, monuments and temples, and the consequent increase in trade.&#10;&#10;In Babylonia, you try to make your clan prosper under the peace and imperial power of that era. You have to place your nobles, priests, and craftsmen tokens on the map to make your relations with the cities as profitable as possible. Properly placing these counters next to the court also allows you to gain the special power of some rulers. Finally, the good use of your peasants in the fertile areas gives more value to your crops. The player who gets the most points through all these actions wins.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/XKdSpV2ZTdOEd0NXy3Ig1Q__original/img/Q4u1KwykZGb21eEf0-QLwPx-DQ0=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4657338.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/XKdSpV2ZTdOEd0NXy3Ig1Q__thumb/img/Gvkzb72NQtK-Poor3FJXfj-L8RU=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4657338.jpg
815	256570	Crown of Emara	Good times in the tiny kingdom of Emara: During the reign of King Thedorius the Wise, wars, uprisings, and other inconveniences became a thing of the past. Thedorius always cared more for the well-being of his subjects than for power or riches. Therefore, only the nobleman who is able to care for Emara's citizens as well as Thedorius himself did shall become Thedorius' successor and wear the Crown of Emara.&#10;&#10;To test the skills of all aspirants, Thedorius and his counselors issue a challenge of practical use: Whoever can persuade the majority of the newly arrived citizens in the capital to support their claim shall become the future king of Emara. To achieve this, players have to cater to the citizens' needs and &mdash; most importantly &mdash; offer proper housing for everyone. This means that promoting the building activities in town will be one of the major tasks of the candidates.&#10;&#10;Crown of Emara skillfully combines card actions with worker movement actions, allowing players to plan their turns carefully during their downtime. The two counselors available to every player move in two separate roundabouts, requiring players to optimize every move. Additionally, two scoring tracks lead to a multidimensional playstyle as only the lower score counts towards victory and thus both tracks have to be advanced equally.&#10;&#10;	\N	1	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/fbpFsvwOHlm35p215DXMMg__original/img/vssfilc2Za5P83J9xulHw6I53rU=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic7415514.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/fbpFsvwOHlm35p215DXMMg__thumb/img/Uv71KmElItbtpXW0Pw4VKwYwtDY=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7415514.jpg

Resources that will end the energy crisis on Earth and fuel the deep space expeditions planned as population swells beyond capacity.&#10;            &#10;You have been chosen to lead an elite crew of Pod pilots who will delve below the surface of Mars in Solarus Corporation's first major drilling expedition. As a part of this maiden voyage, the corporation has agreed to let you reinvest any wealth you uncover back into training your Pod pilots, increasing their skills and efficiencies. Will you be remembered as the greatest Solarus Corporation employee in the galaxy?&#10;&#10;Super Motherload is a tile-laying deck-building game, which means that you have your own deck of cards from which you draw each turn. The cards in your deck start out very basic, but over the course of the game you add new and more powerful cards to it. You use these cards to bomb and drill minerals and other bonuses from the game board. You then use the minerals you've collected as money to purchase better cards for your deck. Some cards give you an immediate bonus when you purchase them, and some give you other bonuses when you use them to drill. Each card you purchase from your library is worth victory points (VPs). You can also gain VPs from achievement cards that become available throughout the game. Whoever has the most VPs at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;Super Motherload features game boards that are added and removed during play to create videogame-like scrolling action, and it challenges spatial relation skills for 2-4 players who love video games, Eurostyle board games, or deck-building card games.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/3PMNKSFpTjthXH5yraVoHA__original/img/v-BqM8wXWQNUfaNrAwQpRrq08MI=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3293385.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/3PMNKSFpTjthXH5yraVoHA__thumb/img/hg0dWfhEVXa-za87Ni5HgEjN2mA=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3293385.jpg

819	45	Perudo	Liar's Dice, a.k.a. Bluff, Perudo or Dudo, is a South American dice game in which each player is given five dice and cup to roll and hide them with. Players make successively higher declarations regarding the results of all the dice remaining in the game, e.g. &quot;there are ten sixes&quot;. However, someone can always contest the bid. When that happens, all the dice are revealed and either the bidder or the caller loses dice, depending on who was correct. The last player with dice is the winner.&#10;&#10;As a public domain dice game, there are a number of variants or similar games called Liar's Dice. This includes one that is often played with Poker Dice, and differs from the marketed versions in that players only declare on their own hand's value (as opposed to all dice being in play), using poker-hand values.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	6	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/UCiGSoCqbOsXS8JzZZC_SA__original/img/wjGWTdm1oFcxipprcBZT9_OZYRc=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic3949242.png	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/UCiGSoCqbOsXS8JzZZC_SA__thumb/img/g9ex_JOJ3_3fekn4UBwx0iiE6Ik=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3949242.png
820	262941	Dominant Species: Marine	Sixty-Something Millions of Years Ago &mdash; A great ice age has ended. With massive warming altering the globe, another titanic struggle for supremacy has unwittingly commenced between the varying animal species.&#10;&#10;Dominant Species: Marine is a game that abstractly recreates a small portion of ancient history: the ending of an onerous ice age and what that entails for the living creatures trying to adapt to the slowly-changing earth.&#10;&#10;Each player will assume the role of one of four major aquatic-based animal classes &mdash; reptiles, fish, cephalopod or crustacean. Each begins the game more or less in a state of natural balance in relation to one another. But that won&rsquo;t last: It is indeed &ldquo;survival of the fittest.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;Through wily action pawn placement, you will attempt to thrive in as many different habitats as possible in order to claim powerful card effects. You will also want to propagate your individual species in order to earn victory points for your animal. You will be aided in these endeavors via speciation, migration and adaptation actions, among others.&#10;&#10;All of this eventually leads to the end game &ndash; the final ascent of a vast tropical ocean and its shorelines &ndash; where the player having accumulated the most victory points will have their animal crowned the Dominant Species.&#10;&#10;But somebody better become dominant quickly, because there&rsquo;s a large asteroid heading this way....&#10;&#10;Game Play&#10;&#10;The large hexagonal tiles are used throughout the game to create an ever-expanding interpretation of the main ocean on earth as it might have appeared tens of millions of years ago. The smaller Hydrothermal Vent tiles will be placed atop some of the larger tiles throughout play, converting them into Vents in the process.&#10;&#10;The action pawns drive the game. Each pawn allows a player to perform the various actions that can be taken&mdash;such as speciation, environmental change, migration or evolution. When placed on the action display, a pawn will immediately trigger that particular action for its owning player. Dominant Species: Marine includes new &ldquo;special&rdquo; pawns that can be acquired during the course of play. These special pawns have enhanced placement capabilities over the &ldquo;basic&rdquo; pawns that each player begins the game with.&#10;&#10;Generally, players will be trying to enhance their own animal&rsquo;s survivability while simultaneously trying to hinder that of their opponents&rsquo;&mdash;hopefully collecting valuable victory points along the way. The various cards will aid in these efforts, giving players useful one-time abilities, ongoing benefits, or an opportunity for recurring VP gains.&#10;&#10;Throughout the game species cubes will be added to, moved about on, and removed from the tiles in play (&ldquo;earth&rdquo;). Element disks will be added to and removed from both animals and earth.&#10;&#10;When the game ends, players will conduct a final scoring of each tile and score their controlled special pawns&mdash;after which the player controlling the animal with the highest VP total wins the game.&#10;&#10;Dominant Species Veterans&#10;&#10;For players of the original Dominant Species, this iteration introduces several key evolutions to the system (pun definitely intended): &#10;&#10;     Actions are taken immediately whenever a pawn is placed instead of waiting to execute actions after all pawns are on the board. This gives players a bit more flexibility in their strategy, doesn&rsquo;t increase game time when more pawns are acquired by players, and lessens the brain-burn quite a bit since it alleviates the burden of having to plan out an entire turn in advance. &#10;     Domination is no longer on a per-tile basis, and is no longer &lsquo;competitive&rsquo; with other players. In this game you check dominance for each element type over the entire earth, and whether or not you dominate an element type is independent of whether one or more opponents also dominate it. Domination of an element is how you acquire &ndash; and try to maintain &ndash; control of the special pawns.&#10;     Animals no longer have default special abilities. Now, players are dealt 3 Trait cards during setup, choosing one to keep and putting the others back in the box. The chosen Trait gives their animal one of eighteen unique abilities spread amongst the Trait cards. &#10;     Acquiring special pawns through domination gives a player great flexibility in planning and executing a strategy. Special pawns can &lsquo;bump&rsquo; an opponent&rsquo;s basic pawn in order to take an action that would otherwise be blocked. They can be placed anywhere on the action display (where basic pawns must be placed in top-to-bottom order only). There are powerful action spaces where only a special pawn can be placed. And at the end of the game, each special pawn awards its owner VPs according to its highest achieved dominance value.&#10;&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/UTBiMz6852dq3K_yfpgpLQ__original/img/tDNHjJ6160FjCjpY8oJuaNPQ7_k=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5998666.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/UTBiMz6852dq3K_yfpgpLQ__thumb/img/JNsz6atITE84iWPiiq7ki1LaSGY=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5998666.jpg
821	204516	878 Vikings: Invasions of England	The year is 878. For the past 75 years, Viking raiding parties from Norway and Denmark have been terrorizing the coasts of England with &lsquo;hit and run&rsquo; attacks. The treasures and stories gained from these attacks have allowed the Norsemen to raise huge hosts of eager men seeking glory and riches. These armies now stand poised to thunder across England where they will settle and farm the fertile land they conquer. The divided English kingdoms are unprepared for this impending onslaught. The Vikings are coming!&#10;&#10;In 878: Vikings &ndash; Invasions of England, players control the invading Vikings or the English nobles who are trying to withstand the invasion. Viking players either play as Norsemen Viking freeman or as the fearless Viking shock troops known as Berserkers. The English play as the Housecarl, the Kings&rsquo; household troops, or as the Thegns who were regional noble Leaders. The English players will also be able to call up the peasant levies, called the Fyrd, to defend their cities.&#10;&#10;Players for each side strategize together in order to coordinate their strategies. Each side attempts to control Cities on the map to win. The English start the game controlling all of England but a Viking Leader will invade from the sea each Turn. The English players raise reinforcements from cities they control, while the Vikings must wait for a new invasion for reinforcements. The game ends when the Treaty of Wedmore is called and the side controlling the most cities wins the game.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/YjEcFRuLQ_fpm-00u0DIQA__original/img/JUbzEvwZs65nOjhDGQPqpIJI84s=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic6421377.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/YjEcFRuLQ_fpm-00u0DIQA__thumb/img/i2ajypoGnUbyRdEhnpSpUkNM5ZU=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6421377.jpg
822	276498	Paris: La Cité de la Lumière	Paris is a two-player board game by Jos&eacute; Antonio Abascal infused with Parisian aesthetics by the boardgame&rsquo;s artist Oriol Hern&aacute;ndez. The game is set in late 19th century Paris during the 1889 &ldquo;Exposition Universelle,&rdquo; or world&rsquo;s fair, when public electricity was a hot topic. Electricity spread throughout the city, creating today&rsquo;s beautiful nocturnal Parisian streets and coining Paris&rsquo;s nickname &ldquo;La Cit&eacute; de la Lumi&eacute;re&rdquo;, the city of lights.&#10;&#10;The most well-lit buildings are admired more highly by passers-by. In the first phase, players can either place tiles or grow their reserve of buildings. The cobblestone tiles are divided into 4 random spaces (their color, their opponents&rsquo; color, a streetlight or a mixed-color space where either player can build).&#10;&#10;Then, in the second phase, players build on top of their color or the mixed spaces, in effort to position their buildings as close to as many streetlights as possible. More streetlights solicit more adoration and points. The player with the best lit buildings steals the hearts of Parisian pedestrians and wins the game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;	\N	2	2	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/6mIsd0NbfluAAZxwS-3P8Q__original/img/NB6DNhFOUVEcrF-FcjSBBTLcU6Y=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4664437.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/6mIsd0NbfluAAZxwS-3P8Q__thumb/img/mHdyyRSxXnnDNcQsG79crnWDnEw=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4664437.jpg
823	586	Up Front	Only once in a great while does a game dare to be truly different and abandon old concepts while striking out to chart virgin territory in game design. Rarer still are the instances in which these games succeed in presenting a simulation of unparalleled realism in an easily comprehended and playable format. In UP FRONT, we have just such a game. Gone are the hexes and charts of conventional wargames; replaced by innovative and attractive game components which have distilled a wealth of technical data into one of the most playable, yet detail laden formats ever devised.&#10;&#10;UP FRONT is a game of man-to-man infantry combat set in WWII Europe. In many ways, the game is more realistic than SQUAD LEADER principles in that its inherent mechanics simulate the fear and confusion of the battlefield and the inability of leadership to assert itself far better than any tactical combat game yet published. There is no playing board; it has been replaced by Terrain cards which become the &ldquo;hexagons&rdquo; of the game as players maneuver their forces via Action cards over constantly changing terrain. The scale of the game is measured in terms of relative ranges between opposing forces, with most combat occurring within a scale distance of 500 meters during the course of player turns measured in varying seconds of actual time.&#10;&#10;UP FRONT is a game player&rsquo;s game, rich in detail yet easily playable within the space of a lunch hour. However, it also contains engrossing Multi-Player and Campaign Game versions which could last a week or more. Like SQUAD LEADER, UP FRONT is an open-ended game capable of depicting endless Design-Your-Own variations of small unit actions between American, German and Russian combatants. Tanks, Assault Guns, Smoke, Anti-Tank Rifles, Demolition Charges, Pillboxes, Partisans, SS, Entrenchments, Anti-Tank Mines, Infantry Guns, Flamethrowers, Armoured Cars, Halftracks, Panzerfausts, Bazookas, Panzerschrecks, Wire, Ambushes, Radios, Artillery, Minefields, Mortars, Snipers, Starshells, Heroes, Prisoners and Fords are all accounted for. In fact, UP FRONT encompasses almost everything that the SQUAD LEADER game system has taken four gamettes to do, and does so in a far more playable format. The game can be summed up in four words: Innovation, playability, detail and realism. That&rsquo;s an unbeatable combination.&#10;&#10;&#10;UP FRONT is rated 4 on the Avalon Hill Complexity scale of 1 (easy) to 10 (difficult).&#10;&#10;Recommended for two or more discriminating players of skill, ages 12 &amp; up.&#10;&#10;Each game includes: &#10;&#10;     162 full-colour, quality 2&frac14;&quot; &times; 3 &frac12;&quot; playing cards&#10;     120 full-colour 2&quot; &times; 2.6&quot; infantry cards&#10;     40 full-colour 2.3&quot; &times; 3.1&quot; AFV cards&#10;     304 double-faced .75&quot;, .6&quot;, and .5&quot; counters&#10;     12 scenarios with up to four variations of each&#10;     A plastic card tray&#10;     A 36-page rulebook containing Designer&rsquo;s Notes, Historical T, O &amp; E charts and Campaign Game Rosters.&#10;&#10;&#10;	\N	2	2	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/WL-MadX53E3tvRul68pfFA__original/img/HZX8d-qcgaYdNqEwlf6oHjVY4RQ=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic933161.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/WL-MadX53E3tvRul68pfFA__thumb/img/Y3PwO1d75dZZ7Fmmn3KX_wEkbD4=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic933161.jpg
824	251678	Railroad Ink: Blazing Red Edition	In the multiplayer puzzle game Railroad Ink, your goal is to connect as many exits on your board as possible. Each round, a set of dice are rolled in the middle of the table, determining which kind of road and railway routes are available to all players. You have to draw these routes on your erasable boards to create transport lines and connect your exits, trying to optimize the available symbols better than your opponents.&#10;&#10;The more exits you connect, the more points you score at the end of the game, but you lose points for each incomplete route, so plan carefully! Will you press your luck and try to stretch your transportation network to the next exit, or will you play it safe and start a new, simpler to manage route?&#10;&#10;Railroad Ink comes in two versions, each one including two expansions with additional dice sets that add special rules to your games. The Blazing Red Edition includes the Lava and  Meteor expansions. Try to confine the lava coming from the erupting volcano before it destroys your routes, or deal with the havoc brought by the meteor strikes and mine the craters for precious ore. These special rules can spice up things and make each game play and feel different.&#10;&#10;Each box allows you to play from 1 to 6 players, and if you combine more boxes, you can play with up to 12 players (or more).

825	51	Ricochet Robots	Ricochet Robots is less of a game and more of a puzzle, which explains why there's such an odd number of solutions possible. There's a four-piece modular board that forms a large room with walls spread around the board. There are also color-coded targets on boards. Placed on top of the surface are four robots. The idea for each turn/puzzle is to get the like-colored robot to a randomly selected target. The trick is that once a robot starts moving, it will continue to move until a wall or another robot stops it. Therefore, players are seeking a sequence of moves for the robots that will enable them to move the required robot to the target in the fewest moves.&#10;&#10;	\N	1	99	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/3qg1xTP7ZZiu8OolGBYJ1w__original/img/wkfYHdMR_P05Mat4oTHa9cmRNCA=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1766273.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/3qg1xTP7ZZiu8OolGBYJ1w__thumb/img/2LGbUy0Hen-8-8bQ-ZfwHjNnCtU=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1766273.jpg

There are Brimstone cards that make the terrain risky to navigate, which operate similarly to the Tombstone cards from Arcadia Quest: Beyond the Grave.&#10;&#10;A new mechanism called &quot;Damnation&quot; will tempt the heroes with powerful weapons that can corrupt the characters over time or change the behavior of nearby monsters.  There are also Angels, which are allied characters for the heroes to rescue, escort or assist.

827	137988	Zombicide Season 2: Prison Outbreak	Zombicide Season 2: Prison Outbreak takes the players to an indoor environment with vicious close-ranged fights, Prison Outbreak contains all the needed material for a new player to enter the Zombicide universe, and lots of content, almost all new, for an existing Zombicide player to expand his game experience. In fact, Prison Outbreak holds even more material than the core game published in 2012 (now nicknamed Season 1)!&#10;&#10;The Prison Outbreak will feature berserker zombies. They&rsquo;re really tied to each other. Prison tiles display tortuous alleys, small rooms and doors everywhere, filled with berserker zombies immune to ranged weapons. You have to think fast, foresee the improbable and jump into melee at every turn. This is like a modern dungeon where levers are replaced with switches to open or lock doors, use security rooms and reach secret areas.&#10;&#10;Prison Outbreak also contains six new survivors with their Zombivor aspects. These survivors are really designed to act as a team, as their skills really complement each other. They&rsquo;re precious assets to any Zombicide team.&#10;&#10;Missions featured in the rulebook form a campaign on their own, as survivors battle to turn a zombie-filled prison into a reliable shelter. Many challenges await them, but they have new tools of the trade: riot shields, automatic shotguns, concrete saws and many more toys. There&rsquo;s even an alternate ending.&#10;&#10;	\N	1	6	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/bV7_KecPk-fONtD80L-rLA__original/img/j5mYIkVqflkZRRT45KQYg4glZks=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1805937.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/bV7_KecPk-fONtD80L-rLA__thumb/img/VDCEEZ8vZiWD4aOE39EYz1EnIes=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1805937.jpg
828	170416	Vast: The Crystal Caverns	The dragon has been asleep for many long years. In that time, the cave under which it slumbered has changed greatly&hellip;Goblins and strange monsters have filled its gloomy depths and there are whispers that the cave itself has begun thinking, shifting, and growing evermore dangerous.&#10;&#10;Still, stories of peril rarely overshadow the rumors of riches. And riches there may be&hellip; For where a dragon slumbers, there also lies a fiercely guarded treasure. Fortunately for the slumbering beast, malevolent crystals fill the cave&rsquo;s rooms with spectral light, hiding the entrance to the immeasurable treasure trove. Many have given their lives to the search and over the years the rumors have faded to legend.&#10;&#10;But the most courageous adventurers will not be discouraged by bloodshed. On this day, a knight steps into the darkness, her gloved hand gripping the hilt of her sword. Her years of quests--all of the victories and defeats--have led to this one final adventure. Knowing the kingdom can never truly be at peace with the dragon beneath the cave, she has come to make a final stand. Little does she know that she will awake everything that slumbers in the shadows&hellip; and begin the final battle in the darkness.&#10;&#10;Enter the world of Vast: The Crystal Caverns!&#10;&#10;Vast takes you and your friends into the torch light of a classic cave-crawling adventure, built on the concept of total asymmetry. Gone are days of the merry band of travelers fighting off evil. In Vast, you will become part of a new legend... Any part you wish!&#10;&#10;Play as the classic, daring Knight, the chaotic Goblin horde, the colossal, greedy Dragon, or even the Cave itself &mdash; powerful, brooding, and intent on crushing the living things that dare to disturb its gloomy depths. Each role has its own powers, pieces, and paths to victory...and there can be only one winner.&#10;&#10;As the ultimate asymmetric board game, Vast: The Crystal Caverns provides a limitless adventure, playable again and again as you and your friends explore the four different roles in different combinations. Play one-on-one in a race to the death between the Knight and the Goblins, or add in the Dragon and the Cave for deeper and more epic experiences, different every time.&#10;&#10;	\N	1	5	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/CeXtELC0X1xjwuend_7pTg__original/img/y-f2dDCvwurzjcgFPbkj00CbXN8=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2962290.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/CeXtELC0X1xjwuend_7pTg__thumb/img/FdE8SHtb503f9ZOk_TYyxS-sJQg=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2962290.jpg
829	218121	Dice Hospital	In Dice Hospital, a worker placement game, players must treat as many patients as possible to appease the local authorities! Players use their hospital staff to treat patients on their personal hospital player boards. However, players may also call in specialist staff to react to certain situations that arise to score more points with the authorities! The game uses worker placement mechanics for the staff, dice as the patients where low scores indicate low health and a personal player board of actions to treat patients. The player with the highest reputation wins the game!&#10;&#10;	\N	1	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/V6m5SH45BlP6t7-HuGWA-w__original/img/b3B7VSa1WYqfIZhuAj1ClZM9GFg=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3562670.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/V6m5SH45BlP6t7-HuGWA-w__thumb/img/R_6kq0mu1RY7RJVvtI9hRClqpNY=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3562670.jpg
830	131287	Panamax	After one hundred years in service, the Panama Canal still is one of the most important and impressive engineering achievements in modern times.&#10;&#10;Built in 1914, it held a prominent role in the deployment of military vessels during WWI and in the conflicts that have followed. Nowadays commercial usage is the core business of the Canal; its economic impact is profound and has not only developed the region, but in fact helped define shipping throughout the world.&#10;&#10;In the wake of the Canal&rsquo;s opening hull designs were influenced accordingly; ships fell into three categories, those that could travel through easily and in groups (Feeder class), massive ocean-going ships too big to enter the Canal (ULCV or Ultra Large Container Vessels), and the new standard&mdash;designed to the maximum limits of the Panama Canal. These ships are called PANAMAX.&#10;&#10;In Panamax each player manages a shipping company established in the Col&oacute;n Free Trade Zone. Companies accept contracts from both US coasts, China and Europe and deliver cargo in order to make money, attract investment and pay dividends. At the same time the players accumulate their own stock investments and try to make as much money as possible in an effort to have the largest personal fortune and win the game.&#10;&#10;Panamax features several original mechanisms that blend together; an original dice (action) selection table, pickup-and-deliver along a single bi-directional route, a chain reaction movement system&mdash;&ldquo;pushing&rdquo;  ships to make room throughout the Canal and a level of player interaction that is part self-interest, part mutual advantage and the freedom to choose how you play.&#10;&#10;On their turn, players remove a die from the Action table to select Contracts and Load Cargo or Move ships until the pool of dice is emptied ending the Round. Over the course of three rounds these actions are blended during the turn to create a logistics network which the players use to ship their cargo, minimize transportation fees and increase the net worth of their Companies. Each Company has a limited amount of Stock that the players can purchase in exchange for investing&mdash;receiving a dividend each round. The questions for the players will be which companies are likely to yield higher dividends?&#10;&#10;There&rsquo;s more to explore and several ways to win, but we ask that you join us at the table and celebrate the 100th Anniversary of the Panama Canal with a session of Panamax!&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/DjHtKvuSHMdYslgNFyzw1w__original/img/VopILYltj9H--2JkBn2o7Sms-ps=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic1786212.png	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/DjHtKvuSHMdYslgNFyzw1w__thumb/img/bz4ZAigiXzNCwbFnFScPkczKfvw=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1786212.png

The player places his resistance agents on spaces around town to achieve his goals - blowing up trains, publishing underground newspapers - but at the same time Milice collaborators and Wehrmacht soldiers patrol the area. Agents who can't make it back to the safe house at the end of the day are arrested, and never seen again.&#10;&#10;	\N	1	1	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/wgHvFfiPzMJUFrP4OLKtwQ__original/img/PP2_ccIAK3t_y1CU_6Wz4kCR_3c=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5009864.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/wgHvFfiPzMJUFrP4OLKtwQ__thumb/img/OAmwv-znUfaQFLPjiS1BpBjDUtM=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5009864.jpg
833	230244	Black Angel	Humanity, through its irresponsible behavior, has exhausted the natural resources of Earth, making it almost uninhabitable. In a burst of lucidity, pressed by the irreversible degradation of your planet, the great nations are forced to put aside their differences and share their knowledge in order to create the most vast spacecraft ever constructed. Thus, the BLACK ANGEL project is launched.&#10;&#10;The Black Angel, the first intergalactic frigate in history, must transport the genetic heritage of humanity beyond known worlds, over a journey that is likely to last several thousand years. Her crew will be composed of only robots. Because no nation is willing to trust creation of the AI (artificial intelligence) that will control this crew to any other nation, a compromise is found: The Black Angel will be co-managed by several AIs, and the utility of each decision will be evaluated in VP (Validation Process).&#10;&#10;At the completion of this long and perilous voyage, when a new inhabitable planet has been reached, the AI that has earned the most VP will be entrusted with reawakening Humanity, and overseeing its new start&hellip;.&#10;&#10;All the reports are in agreement: The Black Angel is approaching Spes, a planet with the highest probability for habitability by the human species. Take advantage of our approach to maintain the good relations you have gradually woven with the benevolent Alien species populating the galaxy, and watch out for the dreaded Ravagers, who would do anything to prevent you from reaching Spes.&#10;&#10;	\N	1	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/UsG5d8U0wGFJLKctASkWTQ__original/img/S3zJjTPUEcFv3gSXnWU8JfUcaCw=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4830520.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/UsG5d8U0wGFJLKctASkWTQ__thumb/img/WYXRiJNwu_XrUD4H0TVqFGWH2XI=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4830520.jpg
834	36235	The Duke	Levy. Maneuver. Conquer.&#10;&#10;The Duke is a dynamic, tile-based strategy game with an old-world, feudal theme, high-quality wooden playing pieces, and an innovative game mechanism in its double-sided tiles. Each side represents a different posture &ndash; often considered to be defensive or offensive &ndash; and demonstrates exactly what the piece can do within the turn. At the end of a move (or after the use of a special ability), the tile is flipped to its other side, displaying a new offensive or defensive posture.&#10;&#10;Each posture conveys different options for maneuver and attack. The full circle is a standard Move, the hollow circle the Jump, the arrow provides for the Slide, the star a special Strike ability and so on. Each turn a player may select any tile to maneuver, attempting to defend his own troops while positioning himself to capture his opponent's tiles. If you end your movement in a square occupied by an opponent's tile, you capture that tile. Capture your opponent's Duke to win!&#10;&#10;Players start the game by placing their Duke in one of the two middle squares on their side of the game board. Two Footman are then placed next to the Duke. Each turn a player may choose to either move a single tile or randomly draw a new tile from the bag. With fifteen different Troop Tiles, all double-sided, and nineteen total pieces for each player (plus special optional tiles), the variety of game play is limitless.&#10;&#10;Beyond the endless variety of the basic game, Terrain Tiles introduce a variety of game play options, altering the game board. These rules also include several alternate objectives, such as the challenging Dark Rider game which pits five Pikeman against a lone Knight.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	2	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/dDFcB5lodNZxzxfWsTJtUg__original/img/bTgwyvsMbY9BvI-J7JHK6DrUpPw=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1688903.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/dDFcB5lodNZxzxfWsTJtUg__thumb/img/TFdeBRREl0DtKLoCzcT6-Upxy7E=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1688903.jpg
835	318560	Witchstone	As established representatives of your guild, you gather around an ancient sacred stone, the significance and magical powers of which are known to adepts only. Each player occupies one of the four towers around the Witchstone and starts from there. Create your magic spells with the help of your cauldron, and put a network of magic energy around the stone. Send out your witches, scoop the magic crystals out of the cauldron, make use of the pentagram and the magic wand, and keep an eye on the prophecy scrolls in order to ensure victory.&#10;&#10;Not all options are always available to you. Only if you cleverly make the most of your opportunities will you have the chance of accumulating the most victory points over the eleven rounds and thereby win Witchstone.&#10;&#10;Each player in the game has a personal cauldron that bears seven crystals and six pre-printed magic icons, and they share a larger game board that features a crystal ball that shows the entire landscape. Each player has a set of fifteen domino tiles, with each half of the domino being a hexagon; each domino depicts two different magic icons from the six used in the game.&#10;&#10;On a turn, you place one of the five face-up dominos in your reserve onto your cauldron, then you take the action associated with each icon depicted on that domino; if the icon is adjacent to other dominos showing the same icon (or the matching pre-printed icon), then you can take that action as many times as the number of icons in that cluster. You must complete the first type of action completely before taking the second action. With these actions, you can:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Use energy to connect your starting tower to other locations on the game board, scoring 1, 3 or 6 points depending on the length of the connection.&#10;    Place witches next to your starting tower on the game board or move them across your energy network to other locations. As you do this, you gain points and possibly additional actions to use the same turn.&#10;    Move your token around a pentagram to collect points and to acquire bonus hex tiles; you can use these tiles immediately for actions or place them in your cauldron to make future tile placement more valuable.&#10;    Move the crystals in your cauldron, whether to make room for future tile placement or to gain bonus actions by ejecting the crystal completely.&#10;    Advance on a magic wand to gain points and take additional actions, with the actions being doubled should you currently be the most advanced player on the wand.&#10;    Claim scroll cards that boost future actions or earn you bonus points at game's end depending on how well you've completed the prophecy depicted.&#10;&#10;&#10;After each player has completed eleven turns &mdash; which could equal 40-60 actions depending on how well you've used your cauldron &mdash; the game ends and players tally their points from prophecies and other collected scoring markers to see who has the highest score.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/zi0KYvDC394VpxF3b5bpzA__original/img/0590ov78X8pInSRF7YNdVHDecTQ=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic6034602.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/zi0KYvDC394VpxF3b5bpzA__thumb/img/QbsDI5akgmmv0rxve3UdttEYn6M=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6034602.jpg
836	198830	Heroes of Land, Air & Sea	Heroes of Land, Air &amp; Sea is an immersive and strategic 4X-style board game that transports players into a world of epic battles between orcs and humans, dwarves and elves, and warring kingdoms. With beautifully crafted miniatures, this game brings to life the thrilling tale of heroes who shape the course of war.&#10;&#10;&#10;In this game, players take on the role of one of these iconic factions, vying to expand their kingdom and conquer new territories. Every great kingdom starts small, and players begin their journey with just a humble town hall, a handful of peons, and a lone warrior. From this modest beginning, players must venture out, explore the surrounding lands, strengthen their workforce, build a formidable army, and develop their kingdom. This requires careful decision-making, resource management, and strategic warfare.&#10;&#10;&#10;As players progress and achieve milestones in their kingdom's development, they unlock a multitude of advantages. Peons evolve into mighty warriors, warriors ascend to become powerful heroes, and town halls transform into majestic castles. Players also gain access to water vessels and air vessels, as well as mythical creatures. By boarding these vessels and creatures with their units, players can traverse the expansive game board more swiftly and position their armies for devastating attacks.&#10;&#10;&#10;Warfare in Heroes of Land, Air &amp; Sea employs a meticulously designed cost/reward system, outlined on tactics cards that players must secretly select. The availability of these tactics cards depends on the units involved in the conflict. It is during these intense battles that players must showcase their strategic prowess and fight for victory, knowing that history is written by the victors.&#10;&#10;&#10;Furthermore, Heroes of Land, Air &amp; Sea features two distinct economic systems. The first involves the risky acquisition and careful management of vital resources such as food, ore, and mana. The second system introduces a unique twist on worker placement, where players must strategically allocate their peons to construct buildings. However, it&rsquo;s important to note that these peons could also be utilized for exploration, expansion, exploitation, or even extermination! Achieving the perfect equilibrium between these two systems is absolutely pivotal for securing victory in this thrilling game.&#10;&#10;	\N	1	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/MAIDRapFcDC08pmZIBM7EQ__original/img/1VJvbDK3JasY0jizxQpBx0dM-Qc=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic3315057.png	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/MAIDRapFcDC08pmZIBM7EQ__thumb/img/zk2EZaatlJdmd1Rk0tIgSwM4vco=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3315057.png

838	160499	King of New York	There's always something happening in the city that never sleeps. Maybe it's the lights, maybe it's the energy, or maybe it's the giant monsters trying to demolish the place!&#10;&#10;King of New York is a standalone game from designer Richard Garfield that keeps the core ideas of King of Tokyo while introducing new ways to play. As in KoT, your goal is to be the first monster to collect 20 victory points (VPs) or to be the last monster standing. On your turn, you roll six dice up to three times, then carry out the actions on those dice. Claws cause damage to other monsters, hearts heal damage to yourself, and energy is stored up so that you can purchase power cards that provide unique effects not available to anyone else.&#10;&#10;What's new in King of New York is that you can now try to become a star in the big city; more specifically, you can achieve &quot;Fame&quot;, which nets you VPs, but superstar status is fleeting, so enjoy your time in the spotlight.&#10;&#10;The game board for King of New York is larger than in KoT with each monster occupying a district in the city and everyone trying to shine in Manhattan. When you attack, you can displace a monster in another district, whether to escape military forces or to find new smashing opportunities. Yes, smashing because you can now destroy buildings and get bonuses for doing so, but the more destruction you cause, the more intense the military response.&#10;&#10;The monsters from King of New York can be used in KoT and vice versa, but the power cards are specific to this game.&#10;&#10;Part of the King of Tokyo series.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	6	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/FGekxht_r5xqt8oSmQ9HZg__original/img/b5zgGvja0Qpte-Jqb5baQNWuG3c=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2407103.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/FGekxht_r5xqt8oSmQ9HZg__thumb/img/DBoMebkqbcyZWJVLC5MRbF-YbnU=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2407103.jpg

Your elite Bomb Defusal Team (BDT) has been called upon to neutralize the threat. Does your team have what it takes to work through the intricacies of the bombs and defuse them all in time?&#10;&#10;FUSE is a real-time co-operative game that employs 25 dice and 65 cards. Each game is set to a ten-minute timer, and players must work together in that ten minutes to defuse all of the bombs. Each bomb is represented by a card which needs a certain combination of dice in order to defuse it. A player will draw a number of dice equal to the number of players out of a bag and roll them. Players must then decide who will get which dice, but each player must take one and only one.&#10;&#10;It's a simple task: maximize the potential of your dice among all of the players. The problem is that you have only ten minutes, and there are more than twenty bombs on your ship. You don't have time to think through every option.

840	26997	1989: Dawn of Freedom	&quot;History punishes those who come too late.&quot; - Mikhail Gorbachev&#10;&#10;1989: Dawn of Freedom is an exciting, fast paced game simulating the end of the Cold War in 1989. During this amazing year, a series of democratic revolutions ended the 40 year Soviet empire in Eastern Europe. 1989 simulates the political, social and economic aspects of these revolutions using a card-driven system similar to Twilight Struggle.&#10;&#10;&quot;No man is so old he cannot live one more year.&quot; - Leszek Kolakowski&#10;&#10;One player plays the Communist. At the start of the game he holds unquestioned power across the six nations of the Warsaw Pact. But there are ominous clouds on the horizon. The new leader in Moscow has declared no more will Soviet tanks prop up tottering Communist governments. The economies, after decades of central planning and stagnation, have reached various stages of crisis. Inside the churches and among the students and their professors there are dissident movements that have been emboldened. From crushing dissent to offering concessions, the Communist player will have to use a variety of strategies in a struggle to hold on to his empire.&#10;&#10;&quot;A bad regime is never in so great danger as when it tries to improve.&quot; - Alexis de Tocqueville&#10;&#10;The other player plays the Democrat. At the dawn of 1989, behind the iron curtain, no one considers revolution possible. The goal of dissidents is to create a civil society outside the control of the Communist regimes. On their side are students who are fascinated with the style and pop culture of the west, and the Church. Against them is the vast apparatus of the Communist state. Their challenge is to persuade the workers, who are the bulk of society, to join their cause.&#10;&#10;&quot;Mr. Gorbachev, open this gate.

841	1035	Squad Leader	A shot disturbs the eerie silence of a deserted city street, punctuated by the frantic footfalls of men seeking cover. One of Kruger&rsquo;s last veteran nco&rsquo;s lies motionless in the street. The remnants of the dead man&rsquo;s squad are nowhere to be seen&mdash;scattered in nearby houses and gutters&mdash;all thoughts of the advance abandoned with the sudden demise of their leader...the compulsion for revenge obviously overcome by their instinct for self-preservation. Off to the right, Kruger&rsquo;s own men have located the source of the lethal shot and are laying down a steady stream of fire on the church steeple directly ahead. The absence of responding fire suggests that the lone Russian marksman has beat a hasty retreat or been victimized by the withering fire of the German retort. Kruger has seen enough. He is to occupy the church and set up a regimental observation post at once. His orders leave no leeway for delays by a single sniper. He gives the signal to rush the building. Obedient to their training, his men, veterans of France, the Balkans, and 18 months of fighting in Russia, spring to their feet. Seconds later the sharp, staccato retort of a Russian machinegun concludes with the assertiveness of death itself that this time Kruger was wrong...&#10;&#10;This is Squad Leader...a game of WWII tactical combat in Europe. Now you make the instant decisions resulting in life or death for your men, victory or defeat for your army...for YOU are the Squad Leader. YOU direct the fire of your squad, select your plan of attack, or set your defenses against massed Russian human wave or armor assaults. Will that hedgerow provide adequate cover for your flanking efforts, or will your men be cut down by the American machinegun position in the woods? The decision is irrevocable and yours alone. You must live or die by the results.&#10;&#10;Squad Leader utilizes programmed instruction to guide you through 12 scenarios of increasing realism and complexity. The scenarios run the gamut from street fighting in Stalingrad to armored advances across snow covered roads in the Ardennes. A Campaign Game ties the individual scenarios together and allows your own personal leader counter to advance in rank and ability. In addition, a &ldquo;Design Your Own&rdquo; section is included so that players can create an unlimited number of play situations of their own creation.&#10;&#10;Each hex in Squad Leader represents 40 meters of real terrain with counters representing individual leaders, support weapons, and vehicles or 4 man crews and 12 man squads. Each game turn is divided into two player turns with 8 phases, equivalent to two minutes of actual time.&#10;&#10;Squad Leader is more than just a game, it is a game system which can be used to portray any WWII infantry action. Its innovative system does for infantry combat what Panzerblitz and Panzer Leader have done for armored warfare games. Squad Leader provides innovative rules for morale, leadership, machineguns, flamethrowers, demo charges, smoke, hidden placement, sewer movement, off-board artillery, radio contact, anti-tank guns, night actions, wire, entrenchments, mines, bunkers, rubble, multi-story building differentiation, fire, river crossings, roadblocks, mortars, and much more.&#10;&#10;Be forewarned! Squad Leader is not an easy game. Do not attempt it without prior wargaming experience. Squad Leader is rated Tournament Level IV on the A.H. Complexity scale.&#10;&#10;In each game you get:&#10;&#10;&#10;    520 two-sided &frac12;&rdquo; die cut counters representing the men and weapons of the German, Russian, and American armies of WWII.&#10;    192 two-sided &#226;&#133;&#157;&rdquo; die cut counters representing fortifications and individual vehicles of the combatants.&#10;    Big 22&rdquo; x 28&rdquo; four section, full-colour GEOMORPHIC mapboard which can be arranged to make literally hundreds of different terrain configurations that can represent large cities, small villages, wooded hillsides, or even the flat plains of the Ukraine. &#10;    Comprehensive, illustrated 36-page rules of play and designer&rsquo;s notes booklet.&#10;    Scenario cards for the first 12 carefully constructed game situations.&#10;    Two highly refined Quick Reference Data Cards which reduce the complexities of a realistic infantry combat game into easily playable proportions. &#10;&#10;&#10;	\N	2	2	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/jj6tUJH0tQPCEuCjAhioMA__original/img/iDJernkVQTY21VO8NIiLqRpgL34=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic232451.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/jj6tUJH0tQPCEuCjAhioMA__thumb/img/_Z9LnUr4Sp4L9HD0VGHIY4NhA28=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic232451.jpg
842	218479	Cerebria: The Inside World	Cerebria is a dynamic, team-based, objective-driven area control game, where players play as Spirits, powerful entities representing Bliss or Gloom. These opposing forces - the two sides of human nature - struggle to control and shape the Inside World, the metaphorical representation of an evolving personality.&#10; Cerebria introduces a unique theme and numerous innovative mechanisms. The game is centered around the player-controlled Spirits, and the Emotion cards controlling Cerebria&rsquo;s areas, each with their own stats and abilities.&#10;&#10;The Spirits can perform up to three actions on their turn. These include moving between Cerebria&rsquo;s Realms and Frontiers, using the specific powers of the Realms, invoking and upgrading Emotion cards, removing opposing Emotions, and building Fortresses to consolidate their influence on certain areas. The Actions cost Willpower, gained primarily by absorbing from the Origin&rsquo;s Spheres in the middle of the board. Both Bliss and Gloom also have a rare shared team resource, Ambition, enabling them to use the game&rsquo;s most powerful effects.&#10; The teams can score points either by accomplishing publicly known minor objectives (the Intentions), or completing their major objectives (the Aspirations), which change dynamically during the course of the game. Scoring Aspirations allows players to add Bliss and Gloom Fragments to the Identity, built in the middle of the board. These are key moments in the game: Cerebria&rsquo;s state is in constant flux, but the Fragments are permanent imprints of a game state during the scoring events.&#10; The game is won by the side with more influence over the finished Identity, thus becoming the dominant force in Cerebria.&#10;&#10;	\N	1	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/xZ6CZ8_J4CEwR7TT8_3hKw__original/img/7Ni8b05mJH5CcKoFVbRlYrOnR1g=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic3568532.png	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/xZ6CZ8_J4CEwR7TT8_3hKw__thumb/img/DpP7gvOmzFeWhBmdk5XgdKFmK1k=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3568532.png
843	252153	Tang Garden	The Tang dynasty was considered the first golden age of the classical and now iconic Chinese gardens. Emperor Xuanzong built the magnificent imperial Garden of the Majestic Clear Lake as an homage of life itself and from where he ruled. Players will act as Imperial Garden Designers and they will be called to build the most incredible garden while balancing the elements of Nature.&#10;&#10;Tang Garden is a Zen-like game that will take you to the first golden age of China, where players will progressively build a garden by creating the landscape, placing the scenery and projecting their vision through vertical panoramas. During the construction, noblemen will visit the garden to admire the surroundings and the way the natural elements coexist in the most breathtaking scenery humankind has ever laid their eyes upon.&#10;&#10;Players will take turns by playing one of the two actions available in the game:&#10;&#10;1) Placing tiles and matching the elements to increase their personal nature balance and unlock more character miniatures.&#10;&#10;By balancing the nature elements on the player boards, players will attract new characters into the garden. On each player turn, if the elements are balanced, the player will have to choose one miniature from the ones available and finally decide which one of the characters will be placed in the garden, orienting them towards their favorite background, while keeping the other with you to keep exploiting its ability.&#10;&#10;2) Draw decoration cards and place one on the board to get prestige by completing collections.&#10;&#10;Players will draw a quantity of cards based on the board situation and choose one to keep. Players will then have to place the chosen decoration in one of the available spots in the garden, creating a unique and seamless scenario that will never be the same.&#10;&#10;During the game, by placing tiles on special parts of the board, you will be able to place a panorama tile, a new element that adds a never ending perspective for the visitors. Both small and big panoramas will be placed perpendicularly to the board by attaching it to the board insert by creating a seamless look on the four sides of the board. The Panoramas will interact with the characters at the end of the game by giving prestige points based on what your visitor sees and likes.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, the player with the most prestige will be the winner.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;	\N	1	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/FmElPbRBjK5RmrAC9so5Gw__original/img/oZvUwcb2HsJHq8RfZ9UucPrfC-8=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic4109518.png	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/FmElPbRBjK5RmrAC9so5Gw__thumb/img/DBGCgJ7Ynbs3XUEGQjf63AB9QXE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4109518.png

844	299047	Disney Villainous: Perfectly Wretched	In Disney Villainous: Perfectly Wretched, each player takes control of one of three Disney characters, each one a villain in a different Disney movie, specifically Cruella de Vil from 101 Dalmatians, Mother Gothel from Tangled, and Pete from Steamboat Willie. Each player has their own villain deck, fate deck, player board, and 3D character.&#10;&#10;On a turn, the active player moves their character to a different location on their player board, takes one or more of the actions visible on that space (often by playing cards from their hand), then refills their hand to four cards. Cards are allies, items, effects, and conditions. You need to use your cards to fulfill your unique win condition.&#10;&#10;One of the actions allows you to choose another player, draw two cards from that player's fate deck, then play one of them on that player's board, covering two of the four action spaces on one of that player's locations. The fate deck contains heroes, items, and effects from that villain's movie, and these cards allow other players to mess with that particular villain.&#10;&#10;Disney Villainous: Perfectly Wretched is playable on its own, and its characters can also face off against those in the Disney Villainous base game from 2018 and the Disney Villainous: Wicked to the Core and Disney Villainous: Evil Comes Prepared standalone games in 2019.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	3	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/luhDc_P5vImhEiiwVt8IgA__original/img/M6thVohYkKMerLClgOpLLgDoN4k=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic5172286.png	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/luhDc_P5vImhEiiwVt8IgA__thumb/img/UmWQAK4JTYFi8nfs4DjR0mTj-g4=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5172286.png
845	1465	Wizard	The trick-taking game Wizard uses a sixty-card deck that consists of the traditional 52-card deck (1-13 in four suits) along with four Wizards (high) and four Jesters (low).&#10;&#10;Players compete over multiple rounds based on the number of players, and whoever ends with the highest score wins. In each round, players are dealt a hand of cards &mdash; one card in the first round, two cards in the second, three in the third, etc. &mdash; then trump is determined by flipping the top card of the undealt deck; if a suit is revealed, that suit is trump, while if the card turned up is a Jester, it is turned down and there is no trump for that round. If the card turned up is a Wizard, the dealer chooses one of the 4 suits as the trump suit. The dealer cannot choose &quot;no trump&quot;. On the last round of each game all cards are dealt out so there is no trump. Players then state how many tricks they expect to win in the round.&#10;&#10;The playing and winning of the tricks uses mostly standard trick-taking rules. If a player leads a suited card, then all other players must follow suit, if possible. If a player leads a Jester, then the second player determines the suit led. If a player leads a Wizard, then those who follow can play whatever they want. However, in all cases a player may always play a Wizard or Jester, even if they hold cards in the suit led.&#10;&#10;After each player has played a card, determine the winner of the trick as follows: If one or more Wizards were played, the player of the first Wizard wins the trick, collects the cards, and leads to the next trick. If not, whoever played the highest trump wins the trick. If not, whoever played the highest card of the suit led wins the trick. If all players played Jesters, whoever played the first Jester wins.&#10;&#10;After all tricks have been played, players tally their score for the round. If a player matched their bid, winning exactly as many tricks as stated at the start of the round, they score 20 points, plus 10 points for each trick taken. If a player missed their bid, they lose 10 points for each trick that they were off, whether they took more or fewer than predicted.&#10;&#10;A common variant in Wizard is to not allow the total number of tricks bid in a round to match the round number, thereby forcing (at least) one player to be off each round.&#10;&#10;	\N	3	6	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ygVQlepjPxyg7IizSCM_Tw__original/img/r4yWLAxR7Fj3Rnkry3lzSSObufQ=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5948.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ygVQlepjPxyg7IizSCM_Tw__thumb/img/1qmNhxNzPDSu_Am2rmIobVe9J1M=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5948.jpg

Players explore the game world, which is built during the game by laying out tiles, using ready-made player characters and encountering enemies with corresponding miniatures.

All players win together, depending on the scenario, by escaping, saving others or overcoming a threat.&#10;&#10;	\N	1	5	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/pcdCF6fDsqrQlzWtOM-Xkw__original/img/IyIjn-lNfWL-Qx8UNK35Zje1Xlg=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic994268.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/pcdCF6fDsqrQlzWtOM-Xkw__thumb/img/71kj061sVLOZb-OAC1eDrKcjpjA=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic994268.jpg
847	15512	Incan Gold	Diamant &mdash; also published as Incan Gold &mdash; is a quick, fun press-your-luck game. Players venture down mine shafts or explore paths in the jungle by turning up cards from a deck and evenly sharing the gems they find on the way, with any leftover gems being placed on the card. Before the next card is revealed, you have the chance to leave the mine and stash your holdings, including any gems you get on the way out.&#10;&#10;Why would you leave? Because the deck also contains hazards: scorpions, snakes, poison gas, explosions and rockfalls. When a particular hazard is revealed for the second time (e.g., a second scorpion), anyone still in the shaft or on the path has to drop all the gems they've collected that round and flee for safety. The trick is that as more players leave each turn, your share of the pie grows larger, which will perhaps inspire you to explore deeper &mdash; but at the risk of ending up with nothing.&#10;&#10;All editions of Incan Gold and later editions of Diamant include five artifact cards that are shuffled into the deck of gem and hazard cards, either one per round or all at once. When an artifact card is revealed, no one can take this card and it's placed on the path. If exactly one player leaves at the end of a turn, they collect not only all gems that remain on the path, but the artifact as well, which is worth points at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;	\N	3	8	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/GueRjF-4bGb2kiK6oTFBDA__original/img/qg_C_oTM0v161CNN4IvC2RZCImY=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4195192.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/GueRjF-4bGb2kiK6oTFBDA__thumb/img/PuETzC-bOYaKYLUuNxBu8qD6dns=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4195192.jpg
848	254386	Raccoon Tycoon	Astoria is a land bustling with productivity and growth! New towns, factories, and railroads are springing up across the land. A few savvy business tycoons (you and your opponents) are determined to make your fortunes on the crest of this wave. These tycoons start out as the producers of the key commodities: wheat to feed the growing towns and factories, wood and iron to build them, coal to fuel the trains and factories, and manufactured goods and luxuries to fill the insatiable demand of the animals of Astoria.&#10;&#10;Cornering the market for the most valuable commodities can create small fortunes that can be invested in the new businesses, turning them into huge fortunes. The sky is the limit during this Gilded Age!&#10;&#10;In Raccoon Tycoon, players try to produce the most valuable commodities in an ever-changing marketplace. They then use those commodities to build towns, or sell them at the best price to secure great profits that can be used to win auctions for the all-important railroads.

The players are traders in this day, competing to be the first to earn 60 gold by buying and selling tea, hide, fruits, salt, silk, and trinkets.  The game is played with cards that allow players to buy and sell goods, help you or hinder your opponent, and others that add a bit of spice to the game.  Return to the dark continent where the players alternate turns with up to 5 actions each until one player reaches the goal and wins the game.&quot;&#10;&#10;Original description from Games4You.&#10;&#10;Players take on the role of merchants offering their wares from market stands. On a player's turn, he has five actions to choose from. Actions can be used to draw cards, play cards, and activate buildup cards.&#10;&#10;In order to sell wares, the merchants must first lay the wares out, since customers will only buy where all the wares they want are being offered. And since market space is at a premium, players have to think hard about which wares to offer.&#10;&#10;By owning important buildup cards and properly using the assets of other village inhabitants, the merchants succeed in attracting especially many customers to their stalls, making bargain buys, and messing with their opponents' plans.&#10;&#10;The first player to reach a set cash level through buying and selling of wares is the winner.&#10;&#10;The game's attraction lies with the many special cards. Many different combinations are possible during the game, and each game plays out differently as a result.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	2	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ZHpHR-6b7ZjQ97mulBg2fg__original/img/4C2Lj2LKIoyxw53ra48q6uSeg2s=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic253740.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ZHpHR-6b7ZjQ97mulBg2fg__thumb/img/JkV1wP7WPQx8UDMksNC6VZZ-XUw=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic253740.jpg
859	175117	Celestia	In Celestia, a revamped version of Cloud 9, you board an aircraft with a team of adventurers to perform many trips through the cities of Celestia and recover their wonderful treasures. Your journey will not be safe, but you will attempt to be the richest adventurer by collecting the most precious treasures!&#10;&#10;At the beginning of a journey, all players place their pawns within the aircraft; the players start the game with six cards in hand (or eight depending on the number of players). At the beginning of each round, one player is chosen to be the captain of the trip and he rolls 2-4 dice to discover the challenges that they will face: fog, lightning bolts, killer birds, or pirates. He must then play the appropriate cards &mdash; a compass, a lightning arrester, a foghorn, or even cannons &mdash; to continue on the journey and reach the next city. But before the captain plays the appropriate cards, each player must decide whether to stay within the aircraft:&#10;&#10;&#10;     If you exit, you're guaranteed the victory points that come from exploring the current city.&#10;     If you stay on board, you hope to make it to the next city in order to catch more precious treasures. If the captain can't overcome the challenge, though, everyone comes crashing down empty-handed and you'll need to begin a new trip with all passengers on board.&#10;&#10;&#10;During the journey, each adventurer can try to pull out of the game with fabulous objects (a jetpack, astronomy glasses, etc.) or by changing the trip (modifying the travel or abandoning an explorer in the city). As soon as a player earns treasure worth at least fifty points, the game ends and this player wins.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	6	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/8kl6m6m_unthBPw9SxoDQQ__original/img/FtecAcFxPelZCfbWhZlo85uF2Rg=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic6973677.png	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/8kl6m6m_unthBPw9SxoDQQ__thumb/img/vK6rBE3ZjolzG6jEVxJj49MBIc4=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6973677.png

861	30645	Tammany Hall	&quot;The way to have Power is to take it&quot; - William &quot;Boss&quot; Tweed&#10;&#10;Tammany Hall is a game of backstabbing, corruption, temporary alliances, and taking power at all costs. If you want to rule New York, you are going to need to play the city's growing immigrant populations against one another. Help the immigrant groups who owe you political favors, call in those favors to slander your rivals, and win elections.&#10;&#10;In Tammany Hall, players help immigrants settle in New York, collect political favors from those immigrant groups, send ward bosses into Manhattan to secure votes, and slander political opponents. An election is held at the end of every fourth year, and the player who uses his power base best will be elected mayor. The Mayor's grip on the city is tenuous at best. After every election, the Mayor must pay off his political rivals by placing them in offices that they can wield to try to take control of the city. Every player is your friend, every player is your enemy.&#10;&#10;Tammany Hall was the political machine that dominated New York City politics by organizing the immigrant populations. While the organization's influence spanned from its founding in the 1790s to its collapse in the 1960s, this game is set in lower Manhattan roughly between 1850 and 1870 &ndash; the era of Boss Tweed.&#10;&#10;	\N	3	5	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Oesqx8u3Wuwa0S1JcsQREg__original/img/xQZOU1cbg0fU68uKoyQGt3zyfA8=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic5585780.png	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Oesqx8u3Wuwa0S1JcsQREg__thumb/img/GmitOj1Yvh7GO_g3Buwdwo-zMx0=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5585780.png

863	227460	Hannibal & Hamilcar	Hannibal &amp; Hamilcar: Rome vs Carthage is a 20th anniversary edition of the classic Hannibal: Rome vs. Carthage, an asymmetrical card-driven game for 2 players set in the time of the epic struggle between ancient Rome and Carthage. It presents a conflict between two superpowers of Antiquity from the classical Clausewitzian perspective, according to which a power only reverts to military operations when there is no other way to achieve political dominance.&#10;&#10;Hannibal was designed by the world-renowned Mark Simonitch. This 20th Anniversary Edition of the game includes new scenarios and variants. Certain game mechanics have been streamlined, while producing exactly the same game results as the golden classic. Hannibal has won numerous awards (including the Golden Geek Best 2-Player Board Game Award and the Golden Geek Best Wargame Award), and is currently ranked 11th in BoardGameGeek.com&rsquo;s Wargame rankings.&#10;&#10;The original rules and components were updated by Mark Simonitch and Jaro Andruszkiewicz. The development team at PHALANX has given the original game a careful, meticulous update. It is now easier and faster to play. It has received new artwork. The original game has been further enriched by the addition of two new expansions: Sun of Macedon and Price of Failure. These expansions are not Kickstarter exclusives, so they will be available as a separate products. This 20th Anniversary Edition of the game includes new scenarios and variants as well as new graphics, miniatures, new custom dice, extra cards, and a new double-sided mounted board (with the Hannibal map on one side and the Hamilcar map on the other).&#10;&#10;Hamilcar, set during the First Punic War, is a companion game sharing components and using similar mechanics. It introduces a naval system and naval battles. Both players compete for control of the Mediterranean Sea in a conflict that will be described as a war between an elephant and a whale - the struggle of a land-based empire versus the world&rsquo;s naval power. Rome's goal was to break through the island chain of Sicily, Corsica, and Sardinia - Carthage's defensive line to contain Rome on the Italian peninsula.&#10;&#10;In both games players use Strategy Cards for multiple purposes: moving generals, levying new troops, reinforcing existing armies, gaining political control of the provinces involved in the war, and introducing historical events. When two armies meet on the battlefield, a second set of cards, called Battle Cards, are used to determine the winner. Ultimately both players seek victory by dominating both fronts: military and political.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	2	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/PHMTzdpZvTv7Ug4Mx0Lt7w__original/img/azUHdRQJh4UbYRXrkcKSLT4-b9g=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3477797.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/PHMTzdpZvTv7Ug4Mx0Lt7w__thumb/img/gJivqHIFPn1Z_4PDoFqAAZfD4PE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3477797.jpg

865	8125	Santiago	Santiago is about cultivating and watering fields. To accomplish this, a number of tiles denoting various plantation types come into the game each round. The tiles are auctioned off such that each player gets one, and the tiles are then placed onto the game board along with an ownership marker that also indicates how plentiful the tile's yield will be. Whoever bid the lowest in each round gets to be the canal overseer and decides where a canal will be built that round. The other players may make suggestions to help the canal overseer decide, and back up their suggestions with money. The final decision is always wholly up to the overseer, though.&#10;&#10;At the end of each round, players determine what the water supply situation looks like. Should a plantation not be sufficiently watered, its production drops dramatically; should it happen more than once, then that plantation may revert to fallow ground. At game's end, naturally only the cultivated land counts. Each plantation is counted according to type &ndash; the bigger the better. But since the ownership markers play a role as well, the same plantation can give drastically different points for different players.&#10;&#10;	\N	3	5	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/tfDHVFfrC-s0I0KdE5fIbg__original/img/yjgFwEx3YpoBa1SqxSnL-vP8hGg=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic7052960.png	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/tfDHVFfrC-s0I0KdE5fIbg__thumb/img/OjGDUKiMhlFRqFE0BsrjGZXTcPA=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7052960.png
866	264052	Circadians: First Light	We were light years from our home, galaxies away, when we first discovered this ancient celestial body &mdash; a planet filled with intriguing, intelligent lifeforms, not too unlike our own. Some built kingdoms below the surface of the green seas, while others controlled the desert-filled plains and cliffs. Among them we found scientists, inventors, farmers, traders and fighters. While our presence has been unsettling for some, we have had very few incidents with the locals. Still, we Circadians, Earth's famed explorers, must do what we can to ensure peace. We must respect this world and its hosts. The heads of Moontide passed down orders from above. We are to open negotiations with the three clans, in hopes of gaining their favor, along with our own security while on the planet. We must also collect organic samples for the depository on Moontide. This is new ground for all of us, but we must be brave and resourceful. The future of the Circadians depends on it.&#10;&#10;The aim of Circadians: First Light is to lead a team of researchers on the planet of Ryh. Players need to manage their crew (dice) to visit various parts of the planet for trade, farming, construction and research. Players score points for negotiating with the locals, harvesting resources for the depository, upgrading their research base, exploring the planet, and collecting gems. The game is played over eight rounds.

870	30957	Tribune: Primus Inter Pares	In ancient Rome, tribunes were highly esteemed individuals elected by the people to represent them politically and militarily.  In the board game Tribune: Primus Inter Pares, players take on the role of a powerful and ambitious patrician family.  By applying influences and manipulating controls over the various factions, they attempt to pave their way to victory in order to attain the high office of the tribune.&#10;&#10;From the mind of the highly acclaimed designer of Die Macher, Karl-Heinz Schmiel, the gameplay in Tribune  is a combination of worker placement and set collection.  Each round, the players take turns by positioning their followers on the board to garner cards, achieve objectives, and/or attempt to take over factions.  In order to gain control of a faction and to utilize its benefits, one must play a set of cards from that specific group.  That person will remain in command of the faction until someone else stages a successful take-over by having another set that is either of higher quantity or higher sum of values.&#10;&#10;Victory is achieved when a player has met the required number of objectives as specified on the victory condition card selected at the start of the game, which is dependent on the number of participants.  Alternatively, you can choose to forego the use of a condition card and play with the point-value option.  In this variant, the game ends when someone has collected a certain number of the faction markers, and the winner is the one with the highest scores as determined by the points assigned to each achievement.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	5	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/4M-gGQVY5MOtrOkkV8P6fQ__original/img/J8VHW_g2gEhiBt0W_efsALkt35E=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic413081.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/4M-gGQVY5MOtrOkkV8P6fQ__thumb/img/sG_qGOhk9z6N0STHdQV4R3_akCI=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic413081.jpg
871	234671	Pandemic: Rising Tide	It is the dawn of the Industrial Age in the Netherlands. For centuries, the country has relied upon a series of dikes and wind-powered pumps to keep it safe from the constant threat of flooding from the North Sea, but this system is no longer enough.&#10;&#10;In Pandemic: Rising Tide, it is your goal to avert tragedy by constructing four modern hydraulic structures in strategic locations that will help you defend the country from being reclaimed by the ocean. Storms are brewing and the seas are restless. It will take all your guile to control the flow of water long enough to usher in the future of the Netherlands. It's time to get to work.&#10;&#10;Containing the water that threatens to consume the countryside is your greatest challenge. Water levels in a region are represented by cubes, and as the water containment systems currently in place begin to fail, more water cubes are added to the board. With water levels constantly on the rise, failure to maintain the containment system could quickly lead to water spilling across the board.&#10;&#10;To successfully build the four hydraulic structures needed to win a game of Pandemic: Rising Tide, you must first learn to predict and manipulate the flow of water. Failing to maintain safe water levels throughout the country can bring you perilously close to failing your mission. Fortunately, water can be corralled by a strategically placed dike or slowed by pumping water out of a region. Correctly identifying and intervening in at-risk areas can get you one step closer to victory.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	5	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/bmjKiJdNcHLz1yfrFlc0XQ__original/img/vOCrpgtf6VT5KLfR2vvcEYve0-s=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3742452.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/bmjKiJdNcHLz1yfrFlc0XQ__thumb/img/5A09WWDeYRkzdehev5BV0UgC8Zc=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3742452.jpg

873	253499	A War of Whispers	A War of Whispers is a competitive board game for 2 to 4 players. Five mighty empires are at war for the world, but you are no mighty ruler. Instead, you play a secret society that is betting on the results of this war while pulling strings to rig the results and ensure their bets pay off. A War of Whispers is a game of deep strategy, hidden agendas, and shifting loyalties.&#10;&#10;You start the game with five loyalty tokens, each corresponding to one of the five different empires, bet randomly on a loyalty value. Your primary goal is to ensure that when the game ends, the empires you are most loyal to control the most cities across the globe. Gameplay consists of turns broken down into four phases:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Deploy agents phase: In player order (starting with the first player and proceeding clockwise), each player removes, then deploys agents to empire councils, the positions on the board marked Sheriff, Steward, Marshall, and Chancellor.&#10;    Empire turns phase: Each council position on each empire council will take an action. If a player has acquired cards, they may play them during this phase.&#10;    Cleanup phase: Add the turn marker to the next space on the turn tracker, then each player discards down to the hand limit of five cards.&#10;    Swap phase: In player order, each player may swap two of their unrevealed loyalty tokens. If you choose to do so, you must reveal both of the swapped loyalty tokens. They remain revealed for the rest of the game.&#10;&#10;&#10;Gameplay repeats itself in this order four times. When the last space on the turn track is filled, the game ends immediately and scoring commences. The player with the most points based off their empire loyalties and the cities they control wins.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/D3Fl15xiRd0QtghO0ZBiRA__original/img/c88Nn0ANeyrOF6cGvmKYazDtVSw=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4150994.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/D3Fl15xiRd0QtghO0ZBiRA__thumb/img/6HGGwpXvSqqHCUiDZxf-33V8i7Q=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4150994.jpg
874	163602	XCOM: The Board Game	Game description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;You are humanity's last hope.&#10;&#10;In XCOM: The Board Game, you and up to three friends assume the roles of the leaders of the elite, international organization known as XCOM. It is your job to defend humanity, quell the rising panic, and turn back the alien invasion.&#10;&#10;Where the world's militaries have failed to stand against the alien invaders, you must succeed. To do so, you must make strategic use of the resources available to you. You must launch Interceptors to shoot down alien UFOs, assign soldiers to key missions, research alien technology, and use that technology to defend your base &mdash; all while trying to keep the world from collapsing just long enough that you can coordinate one final mission to repel the invaders for good.&#10;&#10;One of the more notable aspects of XCOM: The Board Game is the way that it incorporates a free and innovative digital app into the core of its gameplay. This digital companion will be available both as a downloadable app and as an online tool.&#10;&#10;The app's primary function is to coordinate the escalating alien invasion, randomly selecting from one of five different invasion plans. Each invasion plan represents a general outline that the alien commanders will use to coordinate the arrival of new UFOs, plan strikes against your base, and respond to your successes or failures as it seeks to conquer Earth. The app manages all of these tasks and heightens the game's tension as it forces you to respond in real-time. Then, after you move quickly to coordinate your response, you engage the enemy in the untimed resolution phase and feed the results to the app. Based upon these results, the app launches the invasion's next strikes.&#10;&#10;Additionally, the app teaches you the rules, controls the information that your satellites provide you, and tracks the progress of your resistance efforts, even as it allows you to enjoy the game at any of three levels of difficulty: Easy, Normal, or Hard.&#10;&#10;The use of this app does more than simply streamline your play experience and track your turns in real-time; it also permits a uniquely dynamic turn structure. While the variety of game phases remains the same from round to round, the order in which you and your friends must play through them may change, as may the number of a given phase. As a result, while you'll want to know where UFOs appear before you deploy your Interceptors, the alien invaders may be able to disrupt your satellite intel and force you to deploy your Interceptors on patrol with limited or no knowledge of the UFOs current whereabouts. Similarly, you may be forced to think about the costs of resolving the world&rsquo;s crises before you know how many troops you&rsquo;ll need to commit to your base defense.&#10;&#10;The effect of the app is to immerse you deep into the dramatic tension at the core of XCOM: The Board Game, and it ensures that the game presents a challenging and cooperative (or solo) experience like no other. Just like the XCOM department heads that you represent, you'll need to keep cool heads in order to prevail.&#10;&#10;	\N	1	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/1E7ghRKcegsb941W1QwrOw__original/img/f73J1UFyuBzmOAU8Lt-hy0NkiKs=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2247621.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/1E7ghRKcegsb941W1QwrOw__thumb/img/OQe2YrchPfNyh_LvUx6vCEWGei4=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2247621.jpg
875	333255	Keep the Heroes Out!	An asymmetric, cooperative dungeon defense game for 1-4 players where you play as the monsters protecting their hard earned treasures against invading hordes of looters (so-called heroes) trying to steal it.&#10;&#10;In their turn players draw 5 cards and play, these cards allow them to move, activate the tiles they are to perform the tiles actions, attack heroes, and move their units around. After each player, draw and perform cards from the heroes deck.&#10;&#10;Your goal as a team in every scenario is to survive the 3 levels of threat from the invading heroes by protecting the treasures on each room. If the main treasure is taken, the game ends and you lose, but if you manage to protect the treasures for long enough, you all win.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;	\N	1	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/lfFKMNCzIJesp8IFHK8dEw__original/img/qtWs6Wg0a241k2D1TWWbesVwu-s=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic6985339.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/lfFKMNCzIJesp8IFHK8dEw__thumb/img/3et-UTpNaMhKlHPgnj89mkTkGkU=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6985339.jpg
876	275467	Letter Jam	Letter Jam is a 2-6 player cooperative word game where players assist each other in composing meaningful words from letters around the table. The trick is holding the letter card so that it&rsquo;s only visible to other players and not to you.&#10;&#10;At the start of the game, each player receives a set of face-down letter cards that can be arranged to form an existing word. The setup can be prepared by using a special card scanning app, or by players selecting words for each other. Each player then puts their first card in their stand facing the other players without looking at it, and the game begins.&#10;&#10;The game is played in turns. Each turn, players simultaneously search other players&rsquo; letters to see what words they can spell out (telling the others the length of the word they can make up). The player who offers the longest word can then be chosen as the clue giver.&#10;&#10;The clue giver spells out their clue by putting numbered tokens in front of the other players. Number one goes to the player whose letter comes first in the clue, number two to the second letter etc. They can always use a wild card which can be any letter, but they cannot tell others which letter it represents.&#10;&#10;Each player with a numbered token (or tokens) in front of them then tries to figure out what their letter is. If they do, they place the card face down before revealing the next letter.  At the end of the game, players can then rearrange the cards to try to form an existing word. All players then reveal their cards to see if they were successful or not. The more players who have an existing word in front of them, the bigger their collective success.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;	\N	2	6	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/kBZGJlIqir1I_EVCr2nDbg__original/img/lJRGF7RDvRfo3azopO3tryB6IcI=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4853794.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/kBZGJlIqir1I_EVCr2nDbg__thumb/img/mSl669ndQnGcsmKfe0Yppc1XvbI=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4853794.jpg
877	281655	High Frontier 4 All	This is the 4th ed of Phil Eklund's signature game High Frontier. It started with Rocket Flight (1999), a game with the vision to let &quot;Each player start as a spacefaring company in the year 2020 trying to make a profit in trade and technology development.&quot; Now that we are at that year, High Frontier has evolved into a modular system open to enthusiasts to keep it updated ever farther into the future.&#10;&#10;The Core Game is equivalent to the previous edition's basic and advanced rules, and includes Module 0 (Politics). It also comes with the beginner's game Space Diamonds (accessible to bright children), Race for Glory (introductory, including a playthrough), and a variety of solitaire and cooperative variants. The iconic map of High Frontier is the most comprehensive map of the solar system ever published! Since it is a delta-v map, it offers a completely different view of the accessibility of the worlds that orbit Sol. The cards and map have been expanded and produced in consultation with experts in the field, and the author himself is a former rocket scientist, and we can safely say this is the most accurate yet accessible game of space exploration/exploitation ever published. Transition rules allow High Frontier to work as an independent 4th stage in the Bios:Earth trilogy (Bios: Genesis, Bios: Megafauna, and BIOS: Origins) about the evolution of life on our planet.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;	\N	1	5	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/SjfNTsR84Ad--u5lo6HY-A__original/img/xMVJcFIcFMAECB2IWTh_mRG-o4w=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic5316685.png	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/SjfNTsR84Ad--u5lo6HY-A__thumb/img/waH7O4sQox4guuFAHmst0-H_KHQ=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5316685.png
878	79127	Star Trek: Fleet Captains	Star Trek: Fleet Captains, designed for two or four players, is set in the &quot;Prime Universe&quot; of STAR TREK (as seen in the various TV series and movies up to Star Trek: Nemesis) and is more adversarial in nature when compared to Star Trek: Expeditions.  Each player takes the role of a faction (or race) from the universe.  In the base game, the choices are Klingons and Federation.  Each faction has a number of ships (on Clix dials similar to the Heroclix line of components) of varying ability and with a corresponding &ldquo;size.&rdquo;  Fleets of ships are drafted to a given size total which reflects the victory points required to win.  Thus, larger fleet sizes lead to higher point (and longer games).&#10;&#10;Players then &ldquo;shuffle build&rdquo; a deck of command cards.  Choosing four decks from a set of ten decks per faction.  Each deck has a unique flavor or theme, with corresponding major characters.  For instance the Klingons have a deck themed around larger ships and imperial domination and Gowron is a central character.  The four decks chosen will help to set the player&rsquo;s strategy for winning.&#10;The ships chosen have physical stats like weapons, shields, engines, and sensors. They also have mission totals for science, influence, and combat missions.  These determine the kinds and numbers of each kind of mission cards the player draws to form a mission deck.  Completing missions gains the player points, which will win them the game.   Missions could be as simple as damage an opposing ship that is larger than your own (combat), to as complex as claiming the spaces connecting your command post to your opponents (influence). Thus a player&rsquo;s chosen ships sets the types of missions they will need to earn points and the deck they build determines the way they will complete missions.&#10;&#10;Points can also be earned for non-mission actions such as destroying a ship or building a starbase.&#10;&#10;The game itself plays out on a randomly built board of hex cards, called sectors that start the game unexplored.  As each ship progresses through the sector, the cards are turned face up, revealing what is in that part of the sector (a Class-M planet, a Class-J Nebula, empty space, etc...). There are additionally random events that can occur when exploring, which usually correspond to a single episode of a series (for instance one encounter is &ldquo;trouble with tribbles.&rdquo; Some of these encounters also give victory points.&#10;&#10;Overall, the game can best be thought of as playing out an entire season of Star Trek with the conflict between players representing the major story arc and the turns, missions, and random encounters representing individual episodes.  Players will move their ships, explore space, complete missions, play cards to upgrade their ships (and staff them with famous and not so famous crewmembers), or boost their stats in combat.  Combat, while important, is not the sole path to victory, with the mission cards being the primary factor (some of which will encourage combat).  The style of game will depend heavily on individual player decisions, but no matter what, it will feel like Star Trek.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/UqnetX2v84p9ZMpzB8GiDw__original/img/k-fnWjc0-WfowMr8nNeGZfbWCcQ=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1081488.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/UqnetX2v84p9ZMpzB8GiDw__thumb/img/2MTCJvG13SbBcF92yo-4wuGuY10=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1081488.jpg

992	27976	Heroscape Master Set: Swarm of the Marro	The second Master Set for the HeroScape series of games.&#10;&#10;Many different battlefields can be built by attaching and stacking the tiles. Each unit in the Master Set has a movement rating which is the number of hexes it can move in a turn. Moving up a level counts as a hex; moving down does not incur that penalty. Moving down more levels than your height when moving from one hex to another counts as falling and you might take damage - unless you are falling into water.&#10;&#10;Combat in the game is fairly straightforward. You roll attack dice as listed on your unit's card under attack, and the opponent rolls defense dice equal to the defense number on their unit's card. Skulls rolled in excess of shields count as wounds. When the number of wounds equals the unit's life value, it is killed and removed from the board.&#10;&#10;The master game uses a point system in which players alternate drafting cards until they reach the pre-assigned point value for the scenario. It's possible to bring a &quot;pre-fab&quot; army to the battle in order to save time.&#10;&#10;The game is eminently customizable, with many expansions which add more abilities, terrain, and options. There are also user-created maps, scenarios, custom units and advanced rules available online.&#10;&#10;From the publisher:&#10;For years the Marro have been summoned to Valhalla to expand the will of Utgar at all costs. But rumors are spreading that within the uncharted jungle there is an even greater menace waiting. A great Marro Hive, hidden deep within in the jungle swamps and treacherous rock is continuously spawning new savage predators. These creatures, said to be venomous Marro, perhaps even Hivelords, will emerge from their colony and contaminate the world. Includes 24 detailed miniature figures and 75 interlocking terrain pieces.&#10;&#10;This new Master Set includes everything you need to start your own adventures in the Heroscape world of Valhalla! There are 2 new Terrain Types: Swamp &amp; Swamp Water, as well as more Grass, Sand, Rock, and Water tiles to add to your existing Heroscape battlefields.&#10;&#10;Also included in the set are 7 Unique Heroes, and 3 Common Marro Squads. However, the big news is the inclusion of the Marro Hive. The Hive has special powers directly relating to Common Marro Squad figures.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/NYtpwphT76CH7bpmdJkAaw__original/img/DyR8JvlTxokx8d4kYmfSGW9ej6c=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic268096.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/NYtpwphT76CH7bpmdJkAaw__thumb/img/OrqM15_E2Lj_7bFpsTex2KzJncM=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic268096.jpg
879	117915	Yedo	Japan, 1605 &ndash; Hidetada Tokugawa has succeeded his father as the new Shogun, ruling from the great city of Edo (a.k.a. Yedo), the city known in present times as Tokyo. This marks the beginning of the golden age of the Tokugawa Shogunate and the so-called Edo Period that will last until 1868. Naturally, the most powerful families in Edo immediately try to curry favor with the new Shogun &ndash; and this is the opportunity our clan has been looking for, our chance at power and glory. Our clan will prove ourselves to be indispensable to the new Shogun. We will work from the shadows to acquire information about our rival clans. We will kidnap those who might oppose our ascent and assassinate those who prove a threat. We will use cunning to prevent our adversaries from doing the same to us. We will find glory and honor in the eyes of this new Shogun &ndash; or failing that we will end his rule by any means necessary.&#10;&#10;In the strategy game Yedo, players assume the roles of Clan Elders in the city of Edo during the early years of the Tokugawa Shogunate. The object of the game is to amass Prestige Points, mainly by completing missions. To do so, players must gather the necessary assets and &ndash; most importantly &ndash; outfox their opponents and prevent them from completing their missions.&#10;&#10;There are several ways to reach your goal. Will you try to complete as many missions as possible and hope that your efforts catch the Shogun's eye? Or will you choose a more subtle way of gaining power by trying to influence the Shogun during a private audience? You can also put your rivals to shame by buying lots of luxury goods from the European merchants. It's all up to you &ndash; but be careful to make the right choices, for in Yedo, eternal glory and painful disgrace are two sides of the same coin...&#10;&#10;	\N	2	5	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/jdBgNHtZ5TXAq4jXvN7XyQ__original/img/tUiwp3vNcvSrf7SzmZZq557YjRc=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1633240.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/jdBgNHtZ5TXAq4jXvN7XyQ__thumb/img/drUkVG97U1ZmcAreejXCXVw3Lq8=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1633240.jpg
880	528	ZÈRTZ	In Z&Egrave;RTZ, the third addition to the GIPF Project, players compete to acquire sets of multi-colored balls. This is mostly accomplished by jumping one ball over one or more others, Checkers-style, on a hex board. A player's turn consists of either jumping (which can be forced) or placing any color ball on the board and removing an empty space from the edge of the board. In this manner, the play space continually shrinks, giving the endgame an almost claustrophobic feel.&#10;&#10;This game is part of project GIPF.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	2	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/3aBBkCyv1H8nt84n7eGoAw__original/img/yB4pzxo1JfqEycYD6FBt3ym4eFQ=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3140639.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/3aBBkCyv1H8nt84n7eGoAw__thumb/img/3S1CTtxI6p-WGai7xvCAS-cdJOM=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3140639.jpg
881	12962	Reef Encounter	Reef Encounter is about life on a coral reef! Using polyp tiles, players grow different types of corals, which they can protect from being attacked by other corals through judicious placing of their four shrimp counters. To be successful, players must consume polyps from neighboring corals in order to acquire the 'consumed' polyp tiles that are the key to the game. The consumed polyp tiles have a myriad of uses (and have a similar effect to the action points in games like Tikal and Java). Most importantly, they can be used to flip over or lock the coral tiles, which determine the respective values of the different types of coral at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;Description from the designer, Richard Breese.&#10;&#10;Expanded by:&#10;&#10;    Reef Encounter of the Second Kind&#10;&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Yp3TG2cLcY-AfBJogTiGHg__original/img/s6eJSgafse8-zpbu3jZO_gT9zJU=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic85905.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Yp3TG2cLcY-AfBJogTiGHg__thumb/img/qPAI0c5Z0hkFv89bQR0sgJ2p8o8=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic85905.jpg
882	28181	Combat Commander: Pacific	Combat Commander:Pacific is a card-driven board game covering tactical infantry combat in the Pacific Theater of World War II. CC:P's main theme is the addition of three new factions to the Combat Commander family:&#10;&#10;    Imperial Japan&#10;    the Pacific US - with a strong emphasis on the US Marine Corps&#10;    the Pacific Commonwealth - focusing on Indian and ANZAC forces&#10;&#10;&#10;CC:P is a stand alone game in the card-driven Combat Commander game series. While utilizing Combat Commander: Europe's basic rules, CC:P includes numerous rule tweaks and additions in order to more accurately portray tactical warfare as experienced by the participants in and around the Pacific and Indian Oceans. This slightly ramps up the complexity of the Combat Commander series while at the same time imparting a bit more depth and realism. Just a few of the additions include:&#10;&#10;Banzai attacks;&#10;BARs and Thompson SMGs;&#10;Beach landings &amp; river crossings;&#10;Hidden movement;&#10;Caves;&#10;Scouts;&#10;Aircraft;&#10;Bayonets;&#10;Mortar spotting;&#10;Treetop snipers;&#10;Reconnoitering.&#10;&#10;SCALE: Each hex of a Combat Commander map is roughly 100 feet across (about 30 meters). Each complete Player Turn abstractly represents several seconds of real time. Each complete Game Turn abstractly represents several minutes of real time.&#10;&#10;UNITS: Due in part to the unique composition of late-war USMC squads and the imbedding of specialized weapon teams within IJA squads, the units in the game are represented by 4-6 man Teams and 8-13 man Squads. Radios &mdash; and individual weapons larger than a rifle &mdash; are represented by their own counters. Individual Aircraft are also represented with their own counters.&#10;&#10;VICTORY: Players attempt to achieve victory by moving their combat units across the game map to attack their opponent&rsquo;s combat units and occupy as many objectives as possible. The degree to which a player succeeds or fails is measured by a scenario&rsquo;s specific Objective chits, the destruction of enemy units, and the exiting of friendly units off the opponent&rsquo;s board edge.&#10;&#10;GAME FLOW: A game of Combat Commander is divided into several Time segments. There is no sequence of play to follow, however: each Time segment is divided into a variable number of Player Turns, each of which may consist of one or more Fate Card &quot;Orders&quot; conducted by the active player. Fate Card &quot;Actions&quot; may generally be conducted by either player at any time. &quot;Events&quot; and die roll &quot;Triggers&quot; &mdash; both good and bad &mdash; will occur at random intervals to add a bit of chaos and uncertainty to each player&rsquo;s perfect plan.&#10;&#10;CC:P includes twelve maps featuring terrain specific to the PTO.&#10;&#10;CC:P's playbook includes:&#10;&#10;    twelve scenarios.&#10;    Pacific version of the Random Scenario Generator utilizing the new maps and nationalities. This random scenario system provides an almost unending variety of map configurations, force structures, and combat situations.&#10;    section detailing the differences between CC:P and Combat Commander's first two volumes in order that players familiar with those earlier games can jump right into their first scenario with minimal rules reading.&#10;    examples of play.&#10;    Design &amp; Development notes as well as numerous play hints.&#10;&#10;&#10;Components:&#10;&#10;     352x large counters (5/8&quot;) &#10;     280x small counters (1/2&quot;) &#10;     220x 2.5 x 3.5 cards &#10;     6x 2-sided 17 x 22 maps (twelve maps in total)&#10;     3x 2-sided 8.5 x 11 nation-specific player aid sheets &#10;     2x 1-sided 8.5 x 11 generic player aid sheets &#10;     1x 32-page Rulebook&#10;     1x 32-page Playbook&#10;     1x Track Display&#10;&#10;&#10;NOTE: Combat Commander:Pacific is a stand-alone game.

883	41002	Vasco da Gama	Recruit workers, buy projects, build ships. And use the ships to open new commercial routes to eastern Africa and India, to earn money and glory.&#10;&#10;This is a resource management game, with an element of risk management, that works like this:&#10;&#10;Beginning with the start player, each player takes one numbered disc and places it on top of his own coloured disc in one of the four action areas of the board. A Vasco da Gama tile states a number; everything above this number is free of charge, anything below will have to be paid for, so players will take this into account when taking numbered discs. When all players have placed four discs, a modifier to this 'activation number' is shown, and discs are worked by number. In the crew area players may hire crew and a captain, but this costs money. Each round there is a window of ships. The number on the left is the navigation strength, the number on the right is the required amount of different crew. Players choose a ship, pay for the crew and turn the tile to its other side - with a captain on top. In the navigation area, a player takes his ship and places it in a row of his choice, but he has to take care not to exceed the navigation strength of the ship.&#10;&#10;The game lasts five rounds, after which the player with the most points has won.&#10;&#10;A brief description from the rule book:&#10;&#10;Vasco da Gama was charged with finding a maritime route to India.&#10;&#10;Players play the part of rich shipowners who, under his patronage, aim to achieve prestige and riches. &#10;To succeed in the enterprise, they must manage the money and actions at their disposal in order to hire captains, recruit crew, build ships, launch them, and send them to the landings of Natal, Terra de Boa Gente, Mozambique, Malindi, Mombasa, and Calicut.&#10;&#10;For each ship sent, players will receive an immediate reward and will gain prestige (Victory Points). &#10;The farther the ship is sent, the lower the compensation, but the higher the victory score that the player will earn.&#10;&#10;Ships at landings that are &quot;complete&quot; at the end of the round (i.e. reached by a certain number of Ships) will earn further Victory Points for their owners and will then advance, under certain conditions, to the next Landing. This creates the opportunity to earn again Victory Points in the following Rounds.&#10;&#10;During each Round, Players take actions in various Areas (Navigation, Recruiting, or Purchase Projects or Characters).&#10;Planning is fundamental: The right to take an Action could be free of charge or paid for.&#10;&#10;The earlier a Player plans to take an Action, the more likely that he will have to pay for it.&#10;&#10;Players will have to ask themselves if and how much they are ready to pay for the right to act first in a certain area.&#10;&#10;Vasco da Gama himself will decide which is the first free of charge Action for each Round. He will also help some of the Players by making some money available to them.&#10;&#10;This great maritime enterprise raises the interest of 4 influential Characters.&#10;Aiming to have a substantial role in the development of the new commercial route, they will also provide their favors free of charge to the Players.&#10;&#10;Francisco Alvares (The Priest) will make available a number of Missionaries to be used as crew members, Girolamo Sernigi (The Merchant) will organize Ships built and manned, Bartolomeu Dias (The Leader) will grant an increased initiative and additional Victory Points, and Manuel 1st (The King) will allow Players to take an additional Action in the name of the Portuguese Kingdom.&#10;&#10;The winner is the Player with the highest Victory Points score at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/wiMpH9Cr_zIRMdzSdvyLrA__original/img/bmW65H5hdw8bPe_IT9o97YrS-Kg=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic495883.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/wiMpH9Cr_zIRMdzSdvyLrA__thumb/img/Lnsia_j2EpPeYTIeuEUNpHIk0ns=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic495883.jpg

885	122298	Morels	The woods are old-growth, dappled with sunlight. Delicious mushrooms beckon from every grove and hollow. Morels may be the most sought-after in these woods, but there are many tasty and valuable varieties awaiting the savvy collector. Bring a basket if you think it's your lucky day. Forage at night and you will be all alone when you stumble upon a bonanza. If you're hungry, put a pan on the fire and bask in the aroma of chanterelles as you saut&eacute; them in butter. Feeling mercantile? Sell porcini to local aficionados for information that will help you find what you seek deep in the forest.&#10;&#10;Morels, a strategic card game for two players, uses two decks: a Day Deck (84 cards) that includes ten different types of mushrooms as well as baskets, cider, butter, pans, and moons; and a smaller Night Deck (8 cards) of mushrooms to be foraged by moonlight. Each mushroom card has two values: one for selling and one for cooking. Selling two or more like mushrooms grants foraging sticks that expand your options in the forest (that is, the running tableau of eight face-up cards on the table), enabling offensive or defensive plays that change with every game played. Cooking sets of three or more like mushrooms &ndash; sizzling in butter or cider if the set is large enough &ndash; earns points toward winning the game. With poisonous mushrooms wielding their wrath and a hand-size limit to manage, card selection is a tricky proposition at every turn.&#10;&#10;Following each turn, one card from the forest moves into a decay pile that is available for only a short time. The Day Deck then refills the forest from the back, creating the effect of a walk in the woods in which some strategic morsels are collected, some are passed by, and others lay ahead.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	2	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/79RzPdM2pxmtmNV-bdU7LQ__original/img/viQYXUcyfS3j7BxHRn9o2NUwvZY=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1284667.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/79RzPdM2pxmtmNV-bdU7LQ__thumb/img/5zP3tbw8snCQYnvF5iB9ZteVlgQ=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1284667.jpg
886	285984	Last Bastion	A handful of heroes have just stolen the powerful relics of the Baleful Queen. Without them, the immortal sovereign is weakened; recovering them is now her sole purpose.&#10;&#10;With the High Mages attempting to destroy them, the heroes have fallen back into the Bastion of the Ancient Kings, where they must defend the fort to the peril their lives.&#10;&#10;Unceasingly, the hordes led by the Warlords besiege the ramparts. If this citadel falls, an entire civilization will be swept away, and an entire world will fall into chaos...&#10;&#10;Last Bastion is a cooperative game in which the players take on the roles of heroes defending an ancestral Bastion against the monstrous hordes of the Baleful Queen. The players struggle together against the game, either they all win victory, or else they all suffer defeat.&#10;&#10;	\N	1	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/eL5ZK9gerP9D3cld4xXjxQ__original/img/ICX8lnG3G_APxLGcwpM3EXeb96Y=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic4882123.png	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/eL5ZK9gerP9D3cld4xXjxQ__thumb/img/4_3lMCgwHtx3rb42ry8vGqMN2K4=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4882123.png
887	145659	Scoville	The town of Scoville likes it hot! Very hot! That means they love their peppers &ndash; but they're too busy eating them to grow the peppers themselves. That's where you come in.&#10;&#10;You've been hired by the town of Scoville to meet their need for heat. Your role as an employee of Scoville is to crossbreed peppers to create the hottest new breeds. You'll have to manage the auctioning, planting, and harvesting of peppers, then you'll be able to help the town by fulfilling their orders and creating new pepper breeds. Help make the town of Scoville a booming success! Let's get planting!&#10;&#10;A round of Scoville consists of a blind auction, which determines player order, a planting phase, a harvesting phase, and a fulfillment phase. Each round, the players plant peppers in the fields. Throughout the game, the available opportunities for crossbreeding increase as more peppers are planted. When harvesting, players move their pawn through the fields, and whenever they move between two planted fields, they harvest peppers. If, for example, they harvest between fields of red and yellow peppers, they crossbreed those and harvest an orange pepper. Harvested peppers are then used to fulfill the town's peppery desires!&#10;&#10;	\N	2	6	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/strK8aDLCB5KuqU3zirUOg__original/img/lbwzkn8mx_Bsd8aczlW0TqLDKZE=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1903464.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/strK8aDLCB5KuqU3zirUOg__thumb/img/kNiZS7p5xX0fDhetxL35uYxuX58=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1903464.jpg

892	228328	Rurik: Dawn of Kiev	Rurik: Dawn of Kiev is a euro-style realm building game set in an 11th century Eastern European Kingdom. It features area control, resource management, and a new game mechanic - &quot;auction programming.&quot;&#10;&#10;You play as a potential successor to the throne following the death of your father, Vladimir the Great, in 1015. The people value a well-rounded leader, so you must establish your legacy by building, taxing, fighting, and accomplishing great deeds. Will you win over the hearts of the people to become the next ruler of Kievan Rus?&#10;&#10;Rurik brings to life the ancient culture of Kievan Rus with game design by Russian designer Stanislav Kordonskiy and illustrations by Ukrainian artist Yaroslav Radeckyi.&#10;&#10;In Rurik, players openly bid for actions with their advisors. Stronger advisors earn greater benefits at the cost of performing their action later than other players. Conversely, weaker advisors earn lesser benefits but perform their action quickly. This planning mechanism (&quot;auction programming&quot;) adds a fun tension to the game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;	\N	1	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Dduhm8xZl8OURoE28XdIKQ__original/img/FqJD8I3ntO7VR7xYLd2_3sCVSZE=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic4902903.png	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Dduhm8xZl8OURoE28XdIKQ__thumb/img/-brDvVp2xwoOhg4dFmURjf2Ynts=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4902903.png
893	38996	Washington's War	(from GMT's website:)&#10;&#10;Washington&rsquo;s War is the long awaited re-design of the original card driven game, We the People. Washington's War, like its predecessor, pits the forces of a world power (England) against its rebellious American colonists as they fight for their independence.&#10;&#10;Washington&rsquo;s War is a true re-design that maintains the deep strategy of We the People while creating a game with a very short playing time (approximately 90 minutes). Unlike most wargames, Washington's War allows you and your opponent to play twice while switching sides in one sitting. This feature allows for rapid tournament play either face-to-face or on the Internet. Washington's War is the perfect antidote for a time conscious crowd whose only option up to now have been Eurogames.&#10;&#10;Washington&rsquo;s War features a dice-driven combat system that quickly resolves combat and is very friendly to Internet play. The game also features a new CDG discard mechanic that makes every card in your hand playable by allowing your opponent to buy his discarded events for an operations card. Now, unusual card distributions create challenges and not insurmountable barriers for advancing your strategy.&#10;&#10;The biggest design changes between We the People and Washington's War, besides the aforementioned new game mechanics, is the increased emphasis on the asymmetrical capabilities of the two sides. The British are a conventional army with a dominant naval capability that gives them great strengths in the coastal regions. The Americans are an unconvential force with a small Contintental Army led by George Washington who yearn for French intervention. While the British struggle to expand their influence inland, the Americans struggle to keep their militia forces in the field. In the end it is the side that is better able to play to their strengths and protect their vulnerabilities that prevails in Washington's War.&#10;&#10;Washington&rsquo;s War was broadly tested on the Internet in a tournament format to ensure clarity of rules under the stresses of competition. What was old is new again...be the man on the white horse and father a new nation, or be a king trying to save his empire during a world war.&#10;&#10;COMPONENTS:&#10; * 2 Double-thick Counter Sheets&#10; * MOUNTED 22&quot;x34&quot; Map&#10; * 110 Event Cards&#10; * 2 6-sided dice&#10; * Rule Book&#10; * Play Book&#10; * 2 Player Aid Cards&#10;&#10;DESIGNER: Mark Herman&#10;DEVELOPER: Joel Toppen&#10;ART DIRECTOR: Rodger B.

It pits the forces of King George III against the American colonists as they fight for their independence. In Washington&rsquo;s War, you assume the role of either:&#10;&#10;&#10;     The King of Great Britain as he tries to bring his rebellious colonies back into the Empire, while at the same time dealing with a global war against ancient enemies bent on revenge for their losses in the Seven Years War; OR&#10;     The Continental Congress as they battle the forces of Britain, while trying to rally their countrymen to the cause of liberty.&#10;&#10;&#10;Washington&rsquo;s War is not just a re-tread of my earlier design on the same subject, but a true re-design that is keeping the basic feel while simplifying and speeding up what was already a fast paced game. Washington&rsquo;s War features a dice-driven combat system that quickly resolves combat and is very friendly to internet play. The game also features a new CDG discard mechanic that enables a player to play a discarded event for the cost of an operations card. Now unusual card distributions create challenges and not insurmountable barriers to push your strategy forward.

894	12891	Friedrich	Defeat Prussia before the Tsarina dies! Or be Frederick the Great and struggle for survival with a mixture of courageous willpower, sudden inspiration and stoic patience.&#10;&#10;It is the summer of 1756. On the eve of the Seven Years War, half of Europe has formed an alliance. Frederick the Great is in deep sorrow: Is the annihilation of Prussia planned? Is it Prussia's defeat or is it Prussia's glory?&#10;&#10;All against one &ndash; but only one will reign supreme. On a map of Old Europe, players maneuver their generals from city to city. Frederick must retain a part of each Prussian province, while the attacking powers savagely seek out their objectives. The clever use of tactical cards is decisive to winning.&#10;&#10;Histogame and Richard Siv&eacute;l present Friedrich as a novel concept uniting the fascination of board and card games. Accurately based on history while maintaining a slim set of rules, Friedrich offers wide open spaces for chess-like moves and great depth for decision making. Taken into Frederick's era, you will reflect on tactical finesses, smile about interspersed anecdotes, and be perplexed at how often you are not able to count to three...&#10;&#10;Note: A common misconception is that Friedrich has player elimination based on the cards of fate making countries leave the game. The game does not have player elimination; it has country elimination, and a player could end up controlling fewer countries than they started with, but players are never eliminated by the cards of fate.&#10;&#10;Friedrich FAQ&#10;&#10;Details on the Jubil&auml;umsedition&#10;&#10;In 2011 Histogame released a slightly revised version of Friedrich, dubbed the &quot;Jubil&auml;umsedition&quot; or &quot;Anniversary Edition&quot; in honor of Friedrich's 300th birthday. Designer Richard Siv&eacute;l notes the following differences between this edition and earlier ones:&#10;&#10;&#10;     New cover art.&#10;     Four color images for the patterns of the cards.&#10;     Small rearrangements of cities on the map, such as Falkenau (in northwestern Austria) moving into the spades sector and Gollnow (close to Stettin) getting a diamonds-city neighbor.&#10;     Minor adjustment of some fate cards to clarify the wording.&#10;     More details: on this webpage&#10;&#10;&#10;	\N	3	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/K2RGxYiIFQJSkgQHcOsNbA__original/img/BPAUayLVlRU2ZEDR5kGquxt0vq4=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1064931.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/K2RGxYiIFQJSkgQHcOsNbA__thumb/img/8oCcO1XCUEImj-7eQIPDt0iRqxk=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1064931.jpg
895	103886	Star Wars: The Card Game	It is a dark time for the galaxy. The Galactic Empire has consolidated its dominion through the might of the Imperial Navy. In the underworld of the Empire's most populated planets, and in strongholds throughout the Outer Rim, powerful gangsters rule vast criminal organizations. From the shadows, those lost to the grip of the dark side of the Force scheme to bring their evil designs to bear on an already oppressed galaxy.&#10;&#10;Yet not all hope is lost. The Rebel Alliance resists the iron grip of the Empire. Smugglers and other fringe elements lend their aid to the Rebellion. And unknown to the Emperor and his dark minions of the Sith, the last remnants of the noble Jedi Order work tirelessly to restore peace and order to the galaxy.&#10;&#10;Star Wars: The Card Game is a two-player card game that puts one player in command of the Rebels (light side, with the factions Jedi, Rebel Alliance, and Smugglers And Spies), and one player in command of the Empire (dark side, with the factions Sith, Imperial Navy, and Scum And Villainy). The Balance of the Force expansion allows multi-player games. The game is set within the time-frame of the original Star Wars trilogy.&#10;&#10;Each player has a deck of objective cards representing various missions plus a deck of player cards of units (characters, vehicles, droids and creatures), events, enhancements and fates. Each objective is linked to a set of five player cards. Deck construction consists of choosing which objectives are to go into your objective deck, then adding each of those objective's set of five player cards to your player deck. Game play consists of deploying cards to your tableau, attacking your opponent's objectives, defending your own objectives, and committing cards to the Force Struggle.&#10;&#10;The Empire wins if the Death Star dial reaches 12, with this dial increasing by one on each dark side turn, effectively putting a timer on the game. It may also be increased by winning the Force struggle, destroying light side objectives, and via card effects. The Rebels win by destroying three dark side objectives before the Empire wins.&#10;&#10;Contains objective sets 1-36.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	2	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/9CpLES0gHMKgizZReKy-lA__original/img/ruuKzMGJpZRmnvh_vt0RiRxGiFA=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1474141.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/9CpLES0gHMKgizZReKy-lA__thumb/img/mmDFM8nr7vFs0miam67_cypQ5Kk=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1474141.jpg
896	396790	Nucleum	When Elsa von Fr&uuml;hlingfeld presented her invention to King Frederik Augustus II of Saxony, people thought it was trickery. She used the recently isolated element Uranium to heat up a jar of water and used the resulting steam to power an engine that kept the Uranium active via a process she called &ldquo;atomization.&rdquo; Her device, the Nucleum, ushered in a new era of energy and prosperity over the next decades. Saxony went from a minor regional power to the hub of European science and engineering. Now, a generation later, factories are still hungry for more power, demanding bigger and more Nucleums to be built, more Uranium imported from the nearby country of Bohemia, and railways and power lines built across the country to carry the tamed power of the atoms to Saxony&rsquo;s great cities. Inventors, engineers, and industrialists flock to the Saxon court, vying to be the leader in this new industrial revolution.&#10;&#10;Nucleum is a heavy euro board game in which players take role of industrialists trying to succeed during the economic and technological boom of 19th-century Saxony, fueled by the invention and spread of the Nucleum (a nuclear reactor).&#10;&#10;Players earn victory points by developing their networks, building and powering urban buildings, securing contracts, and meeting milestones (randomized endgame goals). Each player also gets unique asymmetric technologies, giving them special powers when unlocked. Gameplay is continuous; players take turns one after another with no rounds or phases.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;	\N	1	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/fIVUaMvbfy6GCOgfxt7xaw__original/img/dBMnuz3SrgxsDLHT6pwbQFPQBIw=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic7647168.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/fIVUaMvbfy6GCOgfxt7xaw__thumb/img/jKsO4nKmtNjX5bfH7aCPeK7hsqU=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7647168.jpg
897	56692	Parade	The characters of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland are having a Parade!&#10;&#10;All players are producers of this parade. Characters from Lewis Carroll's books such as Alice, The White Rabbit, and The Hatter are steadily invited to join this weird procession.&#10;&#10;On your turn, you play a card (from your hand of five) to the end of the parade. Unfortunately, that card might cause other cards to walk off the parade. These cards count as negative points in the end.&#10;&#10;The length of the parade line is important. If the number of the card you just played is less than the line length, you may receive the excess cards (counting from last played to the first of the line). But you don't take all the relevant cards, only the cards that meet one of these requirements:&#10;&#10;1. the color is the same as color of the card just played, or &#10;2. the number is the same or lower than the card just played&#10;&#10;The game ends when the draw deck is exhausted or when one player has collected all six colors in their point piles. Then everyone plays one last card. From the four cards remaining in their hand, players choose two cards to add to his or her point piles. The player who has the least negative points after this is the winner.&#10;&#10;Scoring:&#10;Normally, negative points are same the number on the card. But if you have the most cards in a certain color, each of your cards of that color counts as only 1 negative point!&#10;&#10;Thus, play your cards well!&#10;&#10;	\N	2	6	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/lmRNihICb4mklj0ec1vj6g__original/img/FA-gxYbwNAZl_jwzPjU9n_0Nwbo=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2239001.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/lmRNihICb4mklj0ec1vj6g__thumb/img/UYkr4MpEZv5QiLWW5ef9RUm3gm0=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2239001.jpg

899	239472	Abomination: The Heir of Frankenstein	It's been twenty years since Victor Frankenstein died on a ship in the arctic, but his vengeful creature lives on, as does Robert Walton, the sea captain who vowed to kill the fiend before mercy stayed his hand. It's now 1819, and a sinister darkness descends upon the city of Paris. A mysterious benefactor of gigantic stature has emerged in the scientific community, never showing his face, claiming to possess the late Frankenstein's research. He sponsors a grand competition, offering an even grander prize: unlocking the mystery of mortality!&#10;&#10;Renowned scientists from around the world come to take part: some drawn to solve this eternal riddle, others coerced against their will. But a certain captain comes as well, one deeply suspicious of the secretive patron, hoping to finally fulfill his vow.&#10;&#10;Abomination: The Heir of Frankenstein is a competitive game of strategic monster building for 2-4 players, inspired by Mary Shelley's classic novel of gothic horror. In the game, the creature demands your help to accomplish what his own creator would not: to bring to life an abomination like itself, a companion to end its miserable solitude. Through worker placement and careful management of decomposing resources, you'll gather materials from the cemeteries and morgues around the city, conduct valuable research at the Academy of Science, hire less-than-reputable associates, and toil away in your lab &mdash; all in an effort to assemble a new form of life and infuse it with a &quot;spark of being&quot;. Do well, and the creature may reward you during one of its surprise visits; do poorly, and you may come to regret not putting forth more effort. Narrative elements come into play throughout the game, guided by your decisions, leading to potentially unsavory outcomes.&#10;&#10;The game ends when you succeed in bringing your creation to life or when the Captain kills the creature, whichever happens first. Then the player with the most points fulfills Frankenstein's dark legacy, becoming his heir, for good or ill...&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/JEEZQn4TaBwHuWiPXTpuYA__original/img/bAQ48mOKXYWHyM3EuglzYwngLxc=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4659575.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/JEEZQn4TaBwHuWiPXTpuYA__thumb/img/Bd5QYxQybsaIo8CPXYXDNEzNWQs=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4659575.jpg
900	362944	War of the Ring: The Card Game	Inspired by the best-selling and award-winning War of the Ring board game, War of the Ring: The Card Game allows players to journey to the world of J.R.R. Tolkien&rsquo;s The Lord of the Rings and create their own version of the dramatic conflict between the Dark Lord, Sauron, and the Free Peoples of Middle-earth.&#10;In War of the Ring: The Card Game, up to 4 players compete in two teams, the Shadow against the Free Peoples, each player using a specific and different card deck representing the strengths and weaknesses of the different factions involved in the war.&#10;The Free Peoples desperately try to complete their quest to destroy the One Ring, while at the same time defending their homelands from the encroaching hordes of Sauron and from his evil allies.&#10;&#10;The Shadow players must strike quickly and decisively, before the Ring-bearers can complete their quest; or try to slowly corrupt Frodo, burdening him with wounds, toil, and the sorrow for the loss of his Companions.&#10;&#10;During the game, players will take turns playing cards representing the characters, armies, items, and events of the War of the Ring. Each card they play will help or hinder the journey of the Fellowship as it progresses on its Path; or be used to defend or conquer the strongholds of Middle-earth, as they fight to control the new Battleground cards activated in each round.&#10;&#10;With more than 100 original illustrations from the greatest Tolkienian artists in the world, including an amazing gallery of landscapes from The Shire to Mordor by John and Fataneh Howe, War of the Ring: The Card Game is more than a game &ndash; it also a memorable collection for all lovers of the world imagined by J.R.R. Tolkien.&#10;&#10;This is your chance to forge the destiny of an age, like you never did before!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ScrF673pQhrx27WoVdG81g__original/img/z_hysF8luYEnwfloVsSlUK5r0V4=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic6982333.png	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ScrF673pQhrx27WoVdG81g__thumb/img/mmBKUwRhbgVV4CJOFdWSaJiYcTY=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6982333.png
901	24800	Conflict of Heroes: Awakening the Bear! – Russia 1941-42	Conflict of Heroes is a fast-paced tactical board game series that follows the development of modern day squad and platoon level tactics, starting with World War II and continuing all the way through modern day Bosnia, Iraq, and Afghanistan. The first game in the series, Awakening the Bear! &ndash; Russia 1941-1942, takes you to the eastern front during Operation Barbarossa, the German invasion of Russia. Many consider this time period to be the birth of modern warfare tactics that continue to be used and perfected by today's modern armies.&#10;&#10;Conflict of Heroes merges the elegance of streamlined Eurogame rules with deep strategic wargames. The series was designed to create a tense and highly interactive game play experience. You must manage multiple command resources to move, attack, and take other actions with your units. This gives you great flexibility in executing your battle plans, but makes constant caution necessary as unit activations on either side can happen at any time.&#10;&#10;Much effort went into distinguishing the units in the game by highlighting their historical strengths and weaknesses. For example, each tank defense rating takes into account relative armor thickness, armor slope deflection percentage, speed, size, targeting mechanics, and crew training. All these factors are represented in an easy to learn target number system.&#10;&#10;The included firefights, most of which you can play in about an hour, are designed to depict the pivotal points in a given battle. You can learn enough of the game to play the first scenario in ten minutes thanks to the programmed instruction approach used in the full-color rulebook.&#10;&#10;The game also features three- and four-player firefights and optional rules for solitaire play.&#10;&#10;	\N	1	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ka0fUILEvqQChmMysW2AGw__original/img/5nWdDmx4_ybjykvTeDzQEf4nskY=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2674714.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ka0fUILEvqQChmMysW2AGw__thumb/img/zkiDJ_WUMkq1GdTT-yDvkbb2oeM=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2674714.jpg
902	65244	Forbidden Island	Forbidden Island is a visually stunning cooperative board game. Instead of winning by competing with other players like most games, everyone must work together to win the game. Players take turns moving their pawns around the 'island', which is built by arranging the many beautifully screen-printed tiles before play begins. As the game progresses, more and more island tiles sink, becoming unavailable, and the pace increases. Players use strategies to keep the island from sinking, while trying to collect treasures and items. As the water level rises, it gets more difficult- sacrifices must be made.&#10;&#10;What causes this game to truly stand out among co-op and competitive games alike is the extreme detail that has been paid to the physical components of the game. It comes in a sturdy and organized tin of good shelf storage size. The plastic treasure pieces and wooden pawns are well crafted and they fit just right into the box. The cards are durable, well printed, and easy to understand. The island tiles are the real gem: they are screen-printed with vibrant colors, each with a unique and pleasing image.&#10;&#10;With multiple levels of difficulty, different characters to choose from (each with a special ability of their own), many optional island formats and game variations available, Forbidden Island has huge replay value. The game can be played by as few as two players and up to four (though it can accommodate five). More players translates into a faster and more difficult game, though the extra help can make all the difference. This is a fun game, tricky for players of almost any age. Selling for under twenty dollars, oddly, Forbidden Island is a rare game of both quality and affordable price.&#10; For those who enjoy Forbidden Island, a follow-up project by Gamewright titled Forbidden Desert was released in 2013.&#10;&#10;From the publisher's website:&#10;&#10;Dare to discover Forbidden Island! Join a team of fearless adventurers on a do-or-die mission to capture four sacred treasures from the ruins of this perilous paradise. Your team will have to work together and make some pulse-pounding maneuvers, as the island will sink beneath every step! Race to collect the treasures and make a triumphant escape before you are swallowed into the watery abyss!&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/JgAkEBUaiHOsOS94iRMs2w__original/img/H5d4I5z_HSpPEu7EAl0DqLt9_pM=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic646458.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/JgAkEBUaiHOsOS94iRMs2w__thumb/img/5aPR8-KMbgucI_XkPE2PJaMQQsg=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic646458.jpg
903	137269	Spyrium	Spyrium is set in an alternate world, an England set in a steampunk-based universe. Players build factories, needing workers to manage the production of a commodity previously unknown to us called &quot;Spyrium&quot;. Producing Spyrium in one factory, then processing it in the next results in victory points (VPs) for that particular player. Alternatively, Spyrium can be purchased, but the material is rare and expensive, and players are constantly scraping for money.&#10;&#10;Only those who from the beginning of the game manage to increase their regular income or their base of permanently employed workers (who can be used again and again to raise money) will be flexible enough to get their hands on the important end-of-game buildings to generate many VPs.&#10;&#10;The circular nature of the game is flexible as each player can decide for himself when to move out of the placement phase and into the activation phase. With the two tracks in the game, those involved with delivery during the worker phase can then be used to raise money, to purchase an adjacent card, or to work on their own in an idle factory. All of these things are important, but in the end only the player who has dealt best with the lack of money, workers, and Spyrium will win.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	5	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ze4QFonaGDFj9QTapBQYlg__original/img/0wMKApUujUy_1RbbuZT7CC4kwfc=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1808509.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ze4QFonaGDFj9QTapBQYlg__thumb/img/opVobJGfklKTacqs512ty9kq5QE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1808509.jpg
904	91514	Rhino Hero	Super Rhino! presents players with an incredibly heroic &ndash; and regrettably heavy &ndash; rhinoceros who is eager to climb a tall building and leap other tall buildings in a single bound. First, though, you need to construct that building.&#10;&#10;Players each start the game with five roof cards, and they take turns adding walls and roofs to a single building. On a turn, you first place walls on the highest floor, then you choose a roof card in your hand and place it on the wall. Each roof card bears markings that indicate where the next player must place walls on the card. In addition, some roof cards force a player to perform special actions, such as placing a second roof, changing the direction of play, or moving Super Rhino to a new location on the tower. Keep your hands steady!&#10;&#10;The first player to build all of their roof cards wins the game. Alternatively, if the building collapses, the player who caused the collapse automatically loses, and the player with the fewest roof cards in hand wins.&#10;&#10;Similar to Turmbau zu Babel&#10;&#10;	\N	2	5	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/jRg6horhSAWDITN_tSJuhg__original/img/Y2EbbSt0UAbMy2EZKepbai-XwaY=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic6974609.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/jRg6horhSAWDITN_tSJuhg__thumb/img/AIJuadutdwZfVWSBQGD0x1KneMA=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6974609.jpg
905	198740	Lovecraft Letter	It is the 1920s, and the world is in a state of confusion following WWI. During this time, you and your friends find yourselves amongst mysterious events. You are surrounded by strange figures, letters with unreadable texts, as well as sudden appearances of being unknown. By relying on your connections, you set out to investigate these incidents. Unknown to you are the frightful truths that lie in wait ahead of you...&#10;&#10;Lovecraft Letter is a card game that combines the Love Letter system with the world of H.P. Lovecraft. In addition to the standard sixteen cards in the Love Letter game are new versions of the cards that include special &quot;insanity&quot; powers. If you have one of these cards in your discard pile, then you are insane (at least for the current round) and on future turns can play insanity cards for their regular power or their special power, giving you more options during play. The risk, however, is that you must undergo a sanity check at the start of each of your turns, drawing as many cards from the deck as the number of insanity cards in front of you; draw one or more insanity cards, and you're out for the round.&#10;&#10;If you win the game, whether by being the last person standing or the player with the highest single card after the deck runs out, you win a token colored to reflect whether you were sane or insane. Win enough tokens of the right type, and you win the game. Cthluhu can also help you win the game if you release it at the right time...&#10;&#10;Will you put an end to the evil schemes as an investigator, or will you help guide the world to destruction as one of insanity's disciples? It all depends on you.&#10;&#10;1920&#229;&#185;&#180;&#228;&#187;&#163;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#228;&#184;&#150;&#231;&#149;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#160;&#231;&#172;&#172;&#228;&#184;&#128;&#230;&#172;&#161;&#229;&#164;&#167;&#230;&#136;&#166;&#229;&#190;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#230;&#183;&#183;&#232;&#191;&#183;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#228;&#184;&#173;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#130;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#227;&#129;&#157;&#227;&#130;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#230;&#138;&#152;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#130;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#232;&#186;&#171;&#229;&#134;&#133;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#130;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#229;&#143;&#139;&#228;&#186;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#228;&#184;&#141;&#229;&#143;&#175;&#230;&#128;&#157;&#232;&#173;&#176;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#229;&#135;&#186;&#230;&#157;&#165;&#228;&#186;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#233;&#129;&#173;&#233;&#129;&#135;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#229;&#145;&#168;&#229;&#155;&#178;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#231;&#143;&#190;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#229;&#165;&#135;&#229;&#166;&#153;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#228;&#186;&#186;&#229;&#189;&#177;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#232;&#170;&#173;&#227;&#130;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#230;&#150;&#135;&#229;&#173;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#231;&#182;&#180;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#230;&#137;&#139;&#231;&#180;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#157;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#231;&#170;&#129;&#231;&#132;&#182;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#164;&#177;&#232;&#184;&#170;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#10;&#227;&#129;&#130;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#228;&#188;&#157;&#230;&#137;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#233;&#160;&#188;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#228;&#186;&#139;&#228;&#187;&#182;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#232;&#170;&#191;&#230;&#159;&#187;&#227;&#129;&#184;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#228;&#185;&#151;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#229;&#135;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#227;&#129;&#157;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#133;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#169;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#130;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#230;&#129;&#144;&#227;&#130;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#228;&#186;&#139;&#229;&#174;&#159;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#229;&#190;&#133;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#130;&#231;&#159;&#165;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#154;&#227;&#129;&#171;&hellip;&hellip;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#10;&#230;&#156;&#172;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#131;&#169;&#227;&#131;&#150;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#130;&#191;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#130;&#183;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#131;&#134;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#130;&#175;&#227;&#131;&#136;&#227;&#130;&#165;&#227;&#131;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#149;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#228;&#184;&#150;&#231;&#149;&#140;&#232;&#166;&#179;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#232;&#161;&#168;&#231;&#143;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#233;&#128;&#154;&#229;&#184;&#184;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#187;&#227;&#131;&#131;&#227;&#131;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#229;&#138;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#230;&#129;&#144;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#185;&#227;&#129;&#141;&#229;&#138;&#155;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#230;&#140;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#164;&#231;&#139;&#130;&#230;&#176;&#151;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#230;&#150;&#176;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#229;&#176;&#142;&#229;&#133;&#165;&#227;&#129;&#149;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#229;&#133;&#131;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#231;&#149;&#176;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#229;&#177;&#149;&#233;&#150;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#230;&#165;&#189;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#130;&#128;&#227;&#129;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#10;&#230;&#142;&#162;&#231;&#180;&#162;&#232;&#128;&#133;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#233;&#153;&#176;&#232;&#172;&#128;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#230;&#156;&#170;&#231;&#132;&#182;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#233;&#152;&#178;&#227;&#129;&#144;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#231;&#139;&#130;&#230;&#176;&#151;&#22

906	119788	Hyperborea	The mythical realm of Hyperborea was ruled by an ancient civilization that used magical crystals as their main source of energy. With time, the Hyperboreans became greedy, and their search for power in the deep made the crystals unstable, causing earthquakes, mutations, droughts and floods. Hyperboreans just dug deeper, and only a few wise mages, foreseeing the inevitable, built an unbreakable magical barrier. When the unharnessed magical energy was unleashed from the deep, the Hyperborean civilization was destroyed in a single day, only the magical barrier preventing the disappearance of life from the whole land. The survivors living in the small outposts outside Hyperborea were now sealed out by the barrier. The knowledge of crystals was declared forbidden it was because too dangerous, or simply forgotten.&#10;&#10;Over centuries, six rival realms were born from the ashes of the Hyperborean civilization: the militarist Red Duchy; the Emerald Kingdom and its death-delivering archers; the Purple Matriarchy fanatically worshipping the goddess of life; the skilled diplomats and merchants of the Golden Barony; the Coral Throne with its efficiently organized society and finally the secluded and enigmatic Celestial Reign.&#10;&#10;The fragile peace between the different realms was not intended to last. One day, the magical barrier suddenly collapsed. A whole new land stood in front of the six kingdoms, still haunted by the old Hyperboreans turned into harmless but ominous ghosts, full of ruins to discover and cities to explore. Each realm is now sending its best warriors and explorers to Hyperborea in order to achieve dominance over their rivals, but which will prevail? Brutal strength or deep understanding of science? The discovery of valuable artifacts in the lost ruins or the retaking of long, lost cities? Only you, as the leader of one of the factions, can lead your people to the ultimate dominance over Hyperborea!&#10;&#10;Set in a mythical land of the same name, Hyperborea is a light civilization game for 2 to 6 players that takes 20-25 minutes per player. The game begins at the time when the magic barrier protecting access to the mythical continent of Hyperborea suddenly falls.&#10;&#10;Each player takes the role of the leader of a small kingdom situated just outside the now open to be conquered and explored land. Her kingdom has limited knowledge of housing, trade, movement, warfare, research, and growth, but new and exciting powers are hidden in Hyperborea. During the game, this kingdom will grow in numbers and raise armies, extend its territory, explore and conquer, learn new technologies, etc...&#10;&#10;The game's main mechanism, which can be described as &quot;bag-building&quot;, involves you building a pool of &quot;civilicubes&quot;. Each cube represents specializations for your kingdom: war, trade, movement, building, knowledge, growth. Grey cubes represent corruption and waste, and players will acquire them by developing new technologies. (Power corrupts by its own definition, and the more complex a society becomes, the more waste it generates.) Each turn, players draw three random cubes from their bags, then use them to activate knowledge (technologies) they own.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	6	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/z6R7dbTOJB3dEhNOz5PPTQ__original/img/PKcW1oNZEyAjV4-YrzKfTVlmOX8=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2004236.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/z6R7dbTOJB3dEhNOz5PPTQ__thumb/img/qsmEJDaHpXQkcmbKJbqWvZ9lz_s=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2004236.jpg
907	316546	Clever Cubed	Clever hoch drei features the same gameplay as Ganz sch&ouml;n clever and Doppelt so clever, but with new categories in which to score &mdash; sometimes with several dice at the same time.&#10;&#10;Your goal: Choose dice, then place the numbers into the matching colored area, put together tricky chain-scoring opportunities, and rack up the points. The dice you don't use are as important as what you do because every die that's smaller than the chosen one can be used by the other players, keeping everyone in the game at all times.&#10;&#10;	\N	1	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ksjSyTc0AY0M7CKLD6OA5w__original/img/KivWSWuu1M9OUvga-bmltHA9mRw=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5929690.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ksjSyTc0AY0M7CKLD6OA5w__thumb/img/iNPGRJGuD3nWLqqpW6A2fes34CE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5929690.jpg
908	26990	Container	Container is a game about big ships and big production.  Each player will play both as a producer and shipper of goods.  Players will decide which products they want to produce, and which of the OTHER players' goods they want to ship out to a remote island.  During these phases, players will be able to set the prices for their goods and try to maximize their cash!&#10;&#10;Once the goods have reached the island, players will play the part of the purchaser for their tiny island. Players bid for the goods arriving each day by ship, and the highest bidder collects these goods for conversion into points at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;Sounds simple?  It is! But the real challenge is turning your home production into goods for your island.  Your government is willing to subsidize your purchases, but just how much money do you want to give to your competitors for that lovely crate of goods your island desperately needs?&#10;&#10;	\N	3	5	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/YbUs3F73ptqXzIOC69-q1Q__original/img/geGsCULvv9kL26ihNdyuCjanjHI=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic332933.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/YbUs3F73ptqXzIOC69-q1Q__thumb/img/BiuYaQsfjUr0Hc0oRUN3j7MQDEU=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic332933.jpg
909	18098	Napoleon's Triumph	(From the publisher)&#10;&#10;Napoleon&rsquo;s Triumph is built on the same foundations as its acclaimed predecessor, Bonaparte at Marengo, but is bigger and grander in scale. It uses two boards to make a double-size 44&quot; x 34&quot; map of the Austerlitz battlefield and has twice as many pieces as the earlier game, but defying the tradition that big wargames must also take a long time to play, Napoleon&rsquo;s Triumph can be played from start to finish in a single evening.&#10;&#10;From Back of Box&#10;On December 2, 1805, on the battlefield of Austerlitz, an outnumbered French army led by their newly crowned emperor, Napoleon, waited to receive an expected attack by a Russian and Austrian army commanded by the Russian Czar, Alexander. Napoleon lured the Allies into attacking with their left wing, and when the Allies did so, a surprise French counter-attack smashed the Allied right and centre, and then surrounded and destroyed the Allied left in one of the most famous and decisive battles in military history.&#10;&#10;Napoleon's Triumph re-creates that historic battle. Befitting its epic subject, Napoleon's Triumph is played on a double-sized 44&quot; x34&quot; map of the battlefield.&#10;&#10;In spite of the game's size, it is easy to learn and fast to play. The rules are only nine pages long, and the playing time is only two hours. Napoleon's Triumph is unique among big wargames in that players can learn the game, set it up, and play it to completion in a single evening.&#10;&#10;The game system is derived from its award-winning forebear, Bonaparte at Marengo. Like that game, Napoleon's Triumph breaks with almost all of the standard wargame conventions. It has no hex grid and terrain effects chart; terrain effects are designed into the map itself. It has no combat results table; combat is resolved through strength differential. It has no dice; tension comes from limited information and the outcome only depends on the players' decisions.&#10;&#10;Napoleon's Triumph is a unique wargame experience. It is large, yet fast-playing. It has simple rules, but deep game play that rewards both boldness of conception and attention to detail. It stays close enough to history to engross wargamers and other students of the period, while still being entertaining enough for even non-wargamers to enjoy.&#10;&#10;Napoleon's Triumph is not only easy to learn and fast and exciting to play, it also is a great looking game due to its exceptional component quality.  The map is mounted on a heavy board cut in the German style so that the playing surface is durable, stable, and flat, without the valleys of American-style mounted boards or the buckling of paper boards.&#10;&#10;To represent opposing armies, the game comes with 140 wooden blocks, blue for the French and red for the Allies. Painted on each block are symbols that identify the type and strengths of the unit. The senior commanders of the opposing armies are represented by 18 metal flags; stickers are applied to mark the nationality and name of each commander.&#10;&#10;In play, Napoleon's Triumph combines the visual appeal of 19th century battle maps and military minatures, with columns and rows of units lined for movement and attack, accented by flags to indicate corps. The effect is simply stunning.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	8	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/NTO-71GWQCPtfms6thu_yg__original/img/ggBLDujij6IRGZg0PoMRgBdoC4g=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic291050.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/NTO-71GWQCPtfms6thu_yg__thumb/img/-hEQuP_HebKIh4XlZppUkzMSOtk=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic291050.jpg
910	12902	Carcassonne: The City	Carcassonne: The City is a standalone game in the Carcassonne series. Players build up the old town together by placing tiles. While the town area grows, the town walls grow around it, starting from a wooden gate. The wall is comprised of delicately carved wooden parts, that create a beautiful rendition of the medieval town at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;Next to the slightly modified tile-laying rules, players have the possibility to place their followers as guards on the walls, offering them a wide view of the town. This brings the players extra points. Each player also receives between three and six cylindrical wooden towers (depending on the number of players), giving the town walls an added aesthetic effect.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/tLrK0_NslFKQL6OvpEqi-w__original/img/YsYwH8aiFnMr--fUMTYjNjhy_A4=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic839808.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/tLrK0_NslFKQL6OvpEqi-w__thumb/img/txmUxY2mV7XUjGDuYH0ZlxJtF7A=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic839808.jpg
911	158889	Summoner Wars: Alliances Master Set	Summoner Wars is a fast-playing, action-packed 2-4 player card game. Players take on the role of Summoners: powerful beings who harness the power of mysterious Summoning Stones to lead their race to conquest on the war-torn planet of Itharia. These Summoners wield terrible magic on the battlefield, freezing their foes in place, draining their enemies of power, and even bringing rains of fire down from the heavens. But most notoriously, they summon their great race's hordes of warriors to the battlefield, to clash in the never-ending struggle for supremacy.&#10;&#10;Summoner Wars: Alliances Master Set, a big box starter set for Summoner Wars akin to the Summoner Wars Master Set, features eight complete faction decks and can be played on its own or combined with other Summoner Wars products. All sixteen factions in the SW world are represented as each new summoner is a hybrid of two existing factions, blending the themes of the two factions and expanding deck-building possibilities. The factions are:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Fallen Phoenix: Phoenix Elves/Fallen Kingdom&#10;    Cave Filth: Filth/Cave Goblins&#10;    Tundra Guild: Guild Dwarves/Tundra Orcs&#10;    Swamp Mercenaries: Swamp Orcs/Mercs&#10;    Vargath Vanguard: Vanguard/Vargath&#10;    Sand Cloaks: Cloaks/Sand Goblin&#10;    Deep Benders: Deep Dwarves/Benders&#10;    Jungle Shadows: Shadow Elves/Jungle Elves&#10;&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/tMbeTW1gPc6ueamut0pGNQ__original/img/6Zn32u17ursDAkFVsBD_9lJ9s9c=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2045253.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/tMbeTW1gPc6ueamut0pGNQ__thumb/img/7Zmw-pzwosQgHh8muLAX4ThouQc=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2045253.jpg

913	267319	Roam	Welcome to Arzium, land of ancient civilizations, bizarre creatures, unexplained wonders, and vibrant characters.&#10;&#10;A great sleeping sickness has spread across the land, sending every type of creature to roam for hundreds of miles in a dazed, incoherent march. It's your job to seek them out and wake them from their sleepwalk, recruiting them to help you find even more lost souls!&#10;&#10;In Roam, you and up to three friends compete to find lost adventurers. The game includes more than fifty unique, tarot-sized adventurer cards, which feature characters from Near and Far, Above and Below, and Islebound. The opposite side of each card depicts a landscape split into six squares, and two rows of three of these cards are placed in the center of the playing area to make the board.&#10;&#10;Each turn, you may activate one of the adventurer cards in your party by flipping the card face down. Activating an adventurer allows you to place search tokens on the board in the shape depicted on your adventurer card. When every square on a landscape card has been searched, the player who did the most claims the card, finding the lost adventurer and adding them to their party. Each adventurer you add to your party gives you points and a new search pattern that you can use.&#10;&#10;When searching, you also claim coins, which can be spent to use special actions or purchase artifacts with useful powers. When one player has ten adventurers in their party, the game ends, and the player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/p3O_MWuvpPODqPzxqWf-og__original/img/GhQHUI2ALi0uoRmfa-nOr5dAmwY=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4862867.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/p3O_MWuvpPODqPzxqWf-og__thumb/img/CT4vHKPKP7ftPuxAmUjIw7i2ezM=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4862867.jpg

915	166384	Spyfall	Spyfall is a party game unlike any other, one in which you get to be a spy and try to understand what's going on around you. It's really simple!&#10;&#10;Spyfall is played over several rounds, and at the start of each round all players receive cards showing the same location &mdash; a casino, a traveling circus, a pirate ship, or even a space station &mdash; except that one player receives a card that says &quot;Spy&quot; instead of the location. Players then start asking each other questions &mdash; &quot;Why are you dressed so strangely?&quot; or &quot;When was the last time we got a payday?&quot; or anything else you can come up with &mdash; trying to guess who among them is the spy. The spy doesn't know where he is, so he has to listen carefully. When it's his time to answer, he'd better create a good story!&#10;&#10;At any time during a round, one player may accuse another of being a spy. If all other players agree with the accusation, the round ends and the accused player has to reveal his identity. If the spy is uncovered, all other players score points.  However, the spy can himself end a round by announcing that he understands what the secret location is; if his guess is correct, only the spy scores points.&#10;&#10;After a few rounds of guessing, suspicion and bluffing, the game ends and whoever has scored the most points is victorious!&#10;&#10;	\N	3	8	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Ehx72XRdSeQHISVXcZVnHg__original/img/bI3PgKtvAGiD59QYya-pqasF_tk=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2453926.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Ehx72XRdSeQHISVXcZVnHg__thumb/img/sPJVWjzGcEpiseZGdoD6HNR9nRI=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2453926.jpg
916	317457	Dinosaur World	The triumph of science that led to dinosaurs returning to the world once more has become public knowledge. New parks spring up regularly, often beginning operations even before everything has been finalized. There is no shortage of patrons eager to be entertained by these returned species in new and exciting ways.

This means it is of the utmost importance that you take every precaution by ensuring each visitor signs the safety waiver before enjoying the wonders of Dinosaur World!&#10;&#10;Each round in Dinosaur World, you draft a new r&eacute;sum&eacute; card to acquire new workers; spend workers to take public actions building your park and acquiring DNA; spend further workers to take private actions improving that park; then drive your jeep around experiencing the wonder and excitement of what you have built! Throughout the game you acquire victory points through a variety of means &mdash; and possibly a few visitor deaths as a natural consequence of overly enthusiastic dinosaur encounters. At the end of the game, you lose points if you accumulated too many deaths, then the player with the most points wins!&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/q-CvtJOYWZQDw1tuOdDd4Q__original/img/Eo6IIIYE_Ks1AkMS7garjfSXsh4=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic6020854.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/q-CvtJOYWZQDw1tuOdDd4Q__thumb/img/JmOmFgjBhY0rc1ejk7z7Cw1o9Dw=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6020854.jpg
917	248065	Zombicide: Invader	Humans set off into the stars in search of high-powered fuel and found it in the remote corner of the universe on the small planet PK-L7. Their discovery of Xenium &mdash; a dark, oily compound deep below the planet's surface &mdash; was everything they hoped for. But they found something else, too. The Xenos attack was brutal and unrelenting. While the scientists and soldiers have held them off the best they could, the Xenos are still coming...&#10;&#10;Zombicide: Invader is a cooperative game in which 1-6 players face Xenos, an unfathomable swarm of infected Xenos controlled by the game itself. Each player takes on the role of one to six survivors in a sci-fi setting being overwhelmed by these Xenos. The goal is simple: Choose a mission, complete its objectives, kill as many Xenos as possible, and (most importantly) survive!&#10;&#10;Survivors will fight Xenos, rescue each other, recover vital data, unveil dark secrets, and much more! Survivors can be civilians or soldiers, each with specialized skills. They all play together as a team, trading equipment, and covering each other. They use whatever weapons they can get to kill Xenos and slow the invasion. The better the weapon, the higher the body count, but the more Xenos will appear, attracted by the onslaught! Survivors must also be mindful of their location as conventional weapons work fine indoors, but the planet&rsquo;s oxygen-starved surface, they'll need to arm themselves with more specialized weaponry. Lasers, anyone?&#10;&#10;Most of the time, Xenos are predictable, but there are a lot of them and they use nasty tactics not encountered in previous Zombicide games. Only through cooperation can players achieve the Mission objectives and win.&#10;&#10;	\N	1	6	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/J90Wl4tMo74tS5LtKSSopA__original/img/lYc-4gZdkEtHvp4SP59qH_dMPU4=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4023671.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/J90Wl4tMo74tS5LtKSSopA__thumb/img/GShGBF56oFJoXJQJRm2BT3N67pA=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4023671.jpg
918	196526	Coffee Roaster	Coffee Roaster is a solitaire pool-building game. You choose a variety of coffee beans you want to roast, and put a number of tokens specific to that variety into a bag. Each turn, you draw a number of bean tokens randomly from the bag to advance their roast level. When you are finished, you make a cup-testing to check the taste of your coffee and score points accordingly. Each variety has its own target roast level, but approaching the target is not enough for perfect roasting; you also have to even out the roast level of each bean, while not spoiling the flavor of that variety.&#10;&#10;You also have to screen out smoke tokens and burnt bean tokens that hinder your roasting, and reject bean tokens that spoil the taste. It is important to control the contents of your bag utilizing flavor effects and unique effects caused by placing tokens on the roast board.&#10;&#10;There are 22 varieties of beans in the game.

919	131260	Qwixx	Qwixx is a quick-playing dice game in which everyone participates, no matter whose turn it is. Each player has a scoresheet with the numbers 2-12 in rows of red and yellow and the numbers 12-2 in rows of green and blue. To score points you want to mark off as many numbers as possible, but you can mark off a number only if it's to the right of all marked-off numbers in the same row.&#10;&#10;On a turn, the active player rolls six dice: two white and one of each of the four colors listed above. Each player can choose to mark off the sum of the two white dice on one of their four rows, then the active player can choose to mark off the sum of one colored die and one white die in the row that's the same color as the die. The more marks you can make in a row, the higher your score for that row. Fail to cross off a number when you're the active player, however, and you must mark one of four penalty boxes on your scoresheet. If you mark off the 2 or 12 in a row and have at least five numbers marked in that row, you get to also mark off the padlock symbol in that row, locking everyone else out of this color.&#10;&#10;When either a player has four penalty boxes marked or a second color is locked, the game ends immediately. Players then tally their points for each color, sum these values, then subtract five points for each marked penalty box. Whoever has the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	5	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/aOt-bT9nDzZdWl0dUqLy4w__original/img/BBC0kwf7JPYMxYGnsSDRaZ_BRF4=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1950487.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/aOt-bT9nDzZdWl0dUqLy4w__thumb/img/VSCBC4785-3S8YMBzu8tafaoa_w=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1950487.jpg
920	37380	Roll Through the Ages: The Bronze Age	In Roll Through the Ages, players roll dice to obtain commodities and workers to build up their civilizations. Dice can be rerolled twice unless they come up as a hazard. Players use their workers to build infrastructure to support additional works or to build monuments that are worth points. At the same time, commodities are gathered that allow your civilization to develop. Once all monuments or five developments are achieved by a player, the game ends at the end of the round, points are counted, and a victor is declared.&#10;&#10;The game takes its name from Through the Ages: A Story of Civilization, although the two games have different styles and designers.&#10;&#10;	\N	1	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/VoLyy7ScO6aAU9Neo7KCiA__original/img/Va3l1ZkSn20zIMRt4-xpglPRmy0=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic986758.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/VoLyy7ScO6aAU9Neo7KCiA__thumb/img/sdS7GaTnYXsIsvex3eCwoeMVArg=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic986758.jpg
925	155362	Ca$h 'n Guns: Second Edition	In an abandoned warehouse a gangster band is splitting its loot, but they can't agree on the split! It's time to let the guns talk and soon everyone is aiming at everyone. The richest surviving gangster wins the game!&#10;&#10;Ca$h 'n Guns helps you relive the best scenes of your favorite gangster movies. The goal is to have more money than anyone else after eight rounds while still being alive.&#10;&#10;Each round, one player is the Boss, and he controls the pace of play. First, loot cards are revealed on the table to show what's up for grabs. Next, players load their guns by secretly selecting either a &quot;Bang!&quot; or a &quot;Click! Click!&quot; card from their hand. The Boss counts to three, and on &quot;Three&quot; each player points his foam gun at someone else; due to his status, the Boss can tell one player who's pointing a gun at him that he needs to point it in another direction. After a pause to observe threats and measure the seriousness in an opponent's eyes, the Boss counts to three again and anyone who doesn't want to risk getting shot can chicken out and remove themselves from the round.&#10;&#10;Everyone who's pointing a gun at someone still in the round now reveals their card, and anyone who's the target of a &quot;Bang!&quot; takes a wound marker and gets none of the available loot. Starting with the Boss, everyone still in the round takes one loot card at a time from the table &mdash; money, diamonds, paintings, the position of Boss, medical care (to remove a wound), or a new bullet (to add a &quot;Bang!&quot; card to your hand) &mdash; until everything has been claimed.&#10;&#10;After eight rounds, the game ends. Whoever has the most diamonds receives a big bonus, and paintings score based on the number of them that you've collected. Whoever has the most valuable stash wins!&#10;&#10;	\N	4	8	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/b4qSA5fvVJe9QQOKPCMoNA__original/img/WVKN6ArSni8knEze0BT4VOYB-AY=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2907864.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/b4qSA5fvVJe9QQOKPCMoNA__thumb/img/0yWeezsHg0jGc2flURUSlyqxK2M=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2907864.jpg
921	53953	Thunderstone	For ages the vile Doom Knights have sought to gather the remaining Thunderstones to fulfill a prophecy of corruption over the lands. Now the first Thunderstone has been discovered in the Dungeons of Grimhold and the Doom Knights have sent their minions to claim the relic. The Villagers of Barrowsdale gather brave souls to face the dungeon and keep the Thunderstone out of the hands of the Doom Knights.&#10;&#10;Thunderstone is a fantasy deck-building game much in the style of Dominion. Before the game starts a selection of Village and Hero cards will be randomnly chosen that players may add to their specific decks. Like Dominion, every player starts with a basic deck of weaker cards that they can use to purchase other more powerful cards. In Thunderstone these cards may be different Heroes such as mages, archers, thieves, or warriors or they may be supplies the heroes need like weapons, rations, or light to reach further into the dungeon.&#10;&#10;A dungeon deck is also created by combining several different groups of monsters. Certain groups of monsters may be more or less susceptible to different Hero types, so players will have to take this into account when they choose what to buy.&#10;&#10;Rather than buying puny Victory Points, players will use their deck to defeat monsters in the dungeon. From the monster deck a row of cards is laid out. Players may on their turn choose to attack a monster in the deck rather than visit town and buy cards. If they do this they play cards from their hand and resolve their abilities in order to boost strength and have enough light to reach a specific monster. Some monsters also have special abilities which may hinder the player. If they have enough strength they defeat the monster and place that card in their deck. This card is worth victory points and often can be used as money to purchase other cards. In addition to this, players are awarded experience points for defeating monsters which can be used to upgrade their heroes into more powerful versions. The game is played until the Thunderstone is revealed from the dungeon and a player is able to claim it. The player with the most victory points in their deck is the winner.&#10;&#10;The basic Thunderstone framework was updated in the implementation of Thunderstone: Advance.&#10;&#10;Integrates with&#10;&#10;&#10;    Thunderstone Advance: Towers of Ruin&#10;    Thunderstone: Dragonspire&#10;    Thunderstone: Starter Set&#10;&#10;&#10;	\N	1	5	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/pVyy-LSVBIMQ0GUsvsIfww__original/img/VGifdk1nKtSmzv0Q8aOFqRU3p_o=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic544780.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/pVyy-LSVBIMQ0GUsvsIfww__thumb/img/HSIygEfsQ0wSpnNtrBMgA6Iv5aA=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic544780.jpg
922	2093	Mahjong	Mah-Jongg (Chinese &#233;&#186;&#187;&#229;&#176;&#135;/&#233;&#186;&#187;&#229;&#176;&#134; M&aacute;ji&agrave;ng [game of the] sparrow) is a traditional Chinese game using illustrated tiles, with game play similarities to rummy.  It is a popular gambling game, but wagering real stakes is by no means necessary to have fun playing.&#10;&#10;The tiles consist of three suits numbering 1-9 (Dots, Numbers or Characters, and Bamboo, the &quot;Ace&quot; of which almost always looks like a bird), three different dragons (Red, Green, and White [white is unusual in that it may look like a silvery dragon, or like a picture frame, or blank - think &quot;White dragon in a snowstorm&quot;), and the four winds (east, south, west, and north).  There are four copies of each tile.  This totals to 136 tiles. In addition, special Flower, Season, and Joker (American version) tiles may also be used.&#10;&#10;Four players take turns drawing from a stock (the wall), or from the other players' discards, in an attempt to form sets of numeric sequences (e.g., 5-6-7 of the same suit, which can only be drawn from the player at one's left, by calling &quot;Chow&quot;), triplets and quadruplets (which can be drawn from the discards out-of-turn by calling &quot;Pung&quot;), pairs, and other patterns. &quot;Pung&quot; takes precedence over &quot;Chow&quot;, and &quot;Mah Jongg&quot; takes precedence over all (and is the only situation one may draw &quot;Chow&quot; out-of-turn.) What happens if a single discard would give two (or more!) players &quot;Mah Jongg&quot;? Precedence goes to the player who would play next in normal sequence.&#10;&#10;Originating in China in the mid-19th century, it was introduced to the U.S. in the 1920s.  It is now played in different forms throughout Asia, Europe, North America, Australia, and New Zealand.  Although the rules for game play are fairly constant, there are an immense variety of scoring schemes.  A few general categories of rule-sets include:  Chinese Classical, Hong Kong Old Style, Japanese, Taiwanese, Western, and American.&#10;&#10;	\N	3	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/R2R8UHcaRNJwaCJq8PJGFQ__original/img/qjjJqaGaMogvjhygppEy7Yg5p3E=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic43709.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/R2R8UHcaRNJwaCJq8PJGFQ__thumb/img/wxs22a4TfQjVpfpmNvaTdPo0FHY=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic43709.jpg
923	113997	Tajemnicze Domostwo	Tajemnicze Domostwo is a purely co-operative game for 2-7 players. One player takes the role of a helpful ghost who lives in a mysterious ancient manor. Other players are a group of psychics invited by the manor owner to solve the mystery of the place and bring peace to its residents, as any person who stays in the castle sees strange dreams.&#10;&#10;The ancient legend says the ghost is the soul of the manor's previous resident, who was unjustly executed for a crime he didn't commit, more than one hundred years ago. Now he tries to use the mysterious signs to tell people the truth about what really happened then, so that justice would be established and he might rest in peace for ever. The specialists in the supernatural were invited to try to understand what the ghost wants to tell and in case of success be honored by one more victory and receive a generous reward. They have seven days and seven nights to reach their goal. If they succeed in time, everyone wins the game (including the ghost).&#10;&#10;	\N	2	7	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/6aNWmjHtgPrGpNsO-g0-Iw__original/img/r4mNZSUiYkGq4CfDbCyJ6GzO9Gc=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2601636.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/6aNWmjHtgPrGpNsO-g0-Iw__thumb/img/GwtdrIVeIZSGvz0zX-OG8sWdc1A=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2601636.jpg
924	244992	The Mind	The Mind is more than just a game. It's an experiment, a journey, a team experience in which you can't exchange information, yet will become one to defeat all the levels of the game.&#10;&#10;In more detail, the deck contains cards numbered 1-100, and during the game you try to complete 12, 10, or 8 levels of play with 2, 3, or 4 players. In a level, each player receives a hand of cards equal to the number of the level: one card in level 1, two cards in level 2, etc. Collectively you must play these cards into the center of the table on a single discard pile in ascending order but you cannot communicate with one another in any way as to which cards you hold. You simply stare into one another's eyes, and when you feel the time is right, you play your lowest card. If no one holds a card lower than what you played, great, the game continues! If someone did, all players discard face up all cards lower than what you played, and you lose one life.&#10;&#10;You start the game with a number of lives equal to the number of players. Lose all your lives, and you lose the game. You start with one shuriken as well, and if everyone wants to use a shuriken, each player discards their lowest card face up, giving everyone information and getting you closer to completing the level.

926	148575	Marvel Dice Masters: Avengers vs. X-Men	Marvel Dice Masters: Avengers vs. X-Men is a collectible dice-building tabletop game designed by Quarriors! creators Michael Elliott and Eric M. Lang.&#10;&#10;In this game, each player fields one of the superhero teams, with each hero &mdash; Captain America, Wolverine, Spider-Man, and more &mdash; being represented by custom-tooled dice; each team must be composed of up to 20 dice, and a player can &quot;purchase&quot; dice only from his team. Each hero also has one or more character reference cards, which show the special abilities for the characters based on the die rolls. Different versions of these cards will be available in booster packs, allowing for more customization of your team. Players use these dice to collect energy, recruit new heroes, and battle head-to-head. In addition, each player brings two basic action cards to the game, which are placed in the center of the table; both players can purchase these cards. A player wins once the opposing player has been reduced to zero life.&#10;&#10;The Marvel Dice Masters: Avengers vs. X-Men starter set comes with 44 custom dice, 38 cards, two dice bags, and a core rulebook. Booster packs include two dice with two matching character cards.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	2	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/B1Q__UaxPpu4ltyqLN3mfA__original/img/xTaC6amG90dQhvnvNuKzgnPdtdo=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1997078.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/B1Q__UaxPpu4ltyqLN3mfA__thumb/img/2f2RfgcesLLyeGdNyeqgSEguhiE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1997078.jpg
927	129948	The Palaces of Carrara	In The Palaces of Carrara, players want to buy the marble from this famous region of Italy as cheaply as possible &ndash; but any reduction in price will benefit opponents as well. Maybe you'll find it profitable to instead invest in the buildings created from this marble? Maybe it'll be more worthwhile to grab the expensive raw material when bigger buildings in town turn out to be not so lucrative?&#10;&#10;The game includes two levels of play: beginner and advanced. Co-designer Wolfgang Kramer says, &quot;To understand the game, it's important that players play the beginner version to learn the game mechanisms and how they mesh together.&quot;&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/DsMeW1M58khZlWpHEdGOuw__original/img/40juLFRgylorMnbhK0TR6-l8Wu0=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4398491.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/DsMeW1M58khZlWpHEdGOuw__thumb/img/fUmovwFlp3Ajf5sT0TrzABrBxNs=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4398491.jpg
928	270314	Ohanami	Ohanami consists of a deck of 120 cards that are numbered from 1-120, with each card having one of four symbols on it. The game lasts three rounds, with players scoring at the end of each round, in addition to bonus scoring at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;At the start of a round, each player receives a hand of ten cards. Each player chooses two cards, then passes the remaining cards to the left. All players reveal their cards at the same time, then decide whether to use 0, 1, or 2 of them in personal rows of cards. When you start a row, you can use any card; to add a card to an existing row, that card must be higher than the row's highest card or lower than the lowest one. A player can have at most three rows of cards. Discard any cards you don't use.&#10;&#10;Players repeat this drafting, passing, and playing process until they have played ten cards. The first round ends, and players now receive 3 points for each blue card in their rows.&#10;&#10;Players then receive a new hand of ten cards to start round 2, once again choosing two cards and passing the rest, but now to the right. Players continue building on the rows that they already have, scoring 3 points for each blue card and 4 points for each green card at the end of round two.&#10;&#10;For round three, players have ten more cards and pass cards to the left once again. At the end of this round, players once again score for their blue and green cards, while also receiving 7 points for each gray card in their rows. Additionally, each player scores for their pink cherry blossom cards, with these cards having a pyramidal scoring structure: one card = 1 point, two cards = 3, three cards = 6, etc. Whoever has the highest total score wins!&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/U05-_kgQMravE5OLGuYRnw__original/img/2FfV1ZZsBm6rmQrzwmPoCFS2P-I=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic5591129.png	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/U05-_kgQMravE5OLGuYRnw__thumb/img/eIwj7bu5oPWzswDzGfm73GHaPak=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5591129.png
929	94	Union Pacific	Union Pacific is a train-themed stock market game.  On each turn, players must choose between expanding a company to increase its value and adding a share of stock to their hand, or playing stock onto the table from their hand to increase their ownership of one or two companies.  There are four semi-random scoring events, in which the first and second place share holder in each company are paid dividends.  Only stock that has been previously played onto the table is considered during the scoring rounds.   Union Pacific is a special company whose shares are claimed according to special rules.  Union Pacific is not represented on the board but instead pays dividends to all share holders according to a fixed progression chart.  Money is only used to track victory conditions and cannot be spent during the game.  The winner is the player with the most money at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;Re-implements:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Airlines&#10;&#10;&#10;Re-implemented as:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Airlines Europe&#10;&#10;&#10;	\N	2	6	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/69chi17STdg_NfBrM7UpHA__original/img/1iBmXk3GbNmPiTKI_sdv0rakqaI=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic226392.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/69chi17STdg_NfBrM7UpHA__thumb/img/W6l_vOL8ytRHf8m9-npolkd5NY4=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic226392.jpg
930	195137	Catacombs (Third Edition)	Catacombs is an award-winning, cooperative board game set in the fantasy world of Cimathue, and you need skill and dexterity to master this fast-paced game.&#10;&#10;One player (the Overseer) marshals an army of monsters while the others choose from six brave heroes who embark on a quest to save the town of Stormtryne from the threat lurking in the catacombs below. As the heroes explore, they must use their abilities, buy items, and recruit allies to help them defeat the monsters before facing the powerful Catacomb Lord, thereby saving the town.&#10;&#10;In more detail, in Catacombs players flick wooden discs that represent the monsters and heroes. Contact with an opposing piece inflicts damage, while missiles, spells, and other special abilities can cause other effects. When all of the monsters of a room have been cleared, the heroes can move further into the catacomb.&#10;&#10;Items and equipment upgrades can be purchased from the Merchant with gold taken from fallen monsters. The Catacomb Lord is the final danger that the heroes must defeat to win the game. Conversely, the Overseer wins if all of the heroes are defeated.&#10;&#10;This third edition of Catacombs has all-new artwork compared to the earlier editions, but more importantly the keywords from the first two editions has been replace with iconography, the terminology has changed, and the third edition has new shot types, new card effects, and a different set of components (many of which have changed statistics) as well as wall pieces not present in earlier editions.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	5	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/fc7Ep7xvFxDy_UNOsi2QsQ__original/img/0s87V1cH0Fud15EfJWpxBH2PV2o=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5416481.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/fc7Ep7xvFxDy_UNOsi2QsQ__thumb/img/R2Pp302HiLuQfvqN-zEn6GhZIpE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5416481.jpg
931	346501	Mille Fiori	In Reiner Knizia's Mille Fiori (millefiori is a glasswork technique for decorative patterns, the name means Thousand Flowers), you take the role of glass manufacturers and traders who want to profit as much as they can from their role in the production of fine glass art.&#10;&#10;The game board features different aspects of the glass production cycle: workshops where the glass is created, houses where it's installed, people who support your work, trade shops where it's sold, and the harbor where ships take the glass to faraway locations. You want to be present in all of these areas, preferably at just the right time to maximize your earnings. The gameboard features 109 spaces, with one card in the deck for each of those spaces.&#10;&#10;At the start of a round, each player receives a hand of five cards. Each player chooses a card from hand, then passes the remaining cards to the next player, then each player plays their card in turn, beginning with the round's start player and typically placing a diamond-shaped token of their color in the location depicted on that card:&#10;&#10;&#10;     In the Workshops, you score 1 point for each of your tokens in a connected group with the newly placed token, doubling that score if you played on a pigment field.&#10;     In the Residences, you score the listed number of points, and if your token is preceded in the line by one or more tokens of your color, you score those previously played tokens again.&#10;     In the Townspeople area, you score 1, 3 or 6 points based on the height of your token in the pyramids, but you can only place at higher levels if the lower spaces are filled. Double your points if the card symbol matches the space your filled. Supporting tokens score again as higher tokens are placed.&#10;     In the Trade shops, four types of goods are present, and when you place a token, each token on that goods type scores for its owner points equal to the number of goods of that type now covered.&#10;     In the Harbor, you move your ship equal to the number on the played card, scoring points based on the space where you land, then place a token in one of the five rows. When that row is filled with three ships, each token in that row scores for its owner 1/3/6/10 points depending on the number of trade goods in that row.&#10;&#10;&#10;Alternatively, you can play a card for ship movement points and not place a token on the game board.&#10;&#10;Each player plays four cards in a round (in a 3 or 4 player game), then adds the last card in hand to those displayed beside the game board, then the start player marker rotates and you begin a new round.&#10;&#10;For each of the five areas, you can meet a certain condition that allows you to play a bonus card from those beside the game board, e.g., in the Workshops when you place the third card that surrounds a bonus card symbol, or in the Trade shops when you score a goods type that gives someone else more points than you. When you play a bonus card, you might trigger another bonus card... and then another!&#10;&#10;Additionally, there are five different ways to score substantial bonus points for the areas, e.g., in the Residences you need to place tokens on houses of four different values, and in the Townspeople area you need to place tokens on all three types in a pyramid. You can only score each area's bonus once, and importantly each time a bonus is claimed then the value available for later players is reduced.&#10;&#10;When someone has placed their final diamond token or when you can't deal a new hand of five cards to each player, then the game ends and the player with the most successful glass dynasty (most points) is declared the winner.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/acERQjU6qQ_BGxF3IBri8w__original/img/knjL-l4xv88R0K-RXwSm_iAar-U=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic6703416.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/acERQjU6qQ_BGxF3IBri8w__thumb/img/AHl1ONikJsG3ZqNfow6E_nT0bh0=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6703416.jpg
932	154458	Akrotiri	Akrotiri places you in the role of an explorer in Classical Greek times, combing the then-uncharted Aegean sea for lost Minoan temples that have long ago fallen into ruin. You've not only heard of these temples hidden around the island of Thera, but you actually have access to the secret maps that tell you of their hidden locations! Two mountains to the north?  A volcano to the west? This *must* be the spot...&#10;&#10;But running an expedition can be costly. In order to fund your voyages into the unknown and excavate the ancient temples, you will have to first ship resources found on surrounding islands back to the resource-poor island of Thera.&#10;&#10;In Akrotiri &mdash; which combines tile placement, hand management, and pick-up and delivery &mdash; players place land tiles in order to make the board match the maps that they have in hand. Players excavate temples; the ones that are harder to find and the ones further away from Thera are worth more towards victory, but the secret goal cards keep everyone guessing who the victor is until the end! May the gods forever bless you with favorable winds!&#10;&#10;	\N	2	2	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/fWm7OcbCdC6NtSDDlxkMqg__original/img/vVfmNhU8PfnBhyaX5gT0xZ6089o=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3539688.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/fWm7OcbCdC6NtSDDlxkMqg__thumb/img/QRO6EnTVgARF4N_x30VPAXBlQgc=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3539688.jpg
933	29368	Last Night on Earth: The Zombie Game	Last Night on Earth: The Zombie Game is a survival horror board game that pits small-town heroes head-to-head against a horde of zombies. A team of four heroes is chosen by one set of players, and the zombies are controlled by one or two players. Each hero has its own special abilities. The board is modular, which changes the layout of the town and start positions of each hero. The game comes with several scenarios, which include simple survival, rescue, or escape. Differing combinations of heroes, scenarios, and board configurations offer a lot of replayability.&#10;&#10;A hero deck and a zombie deck deliver tactical bonuses to each side. Combat is resolved using six-sided dice, modified by the weapon cards with which heroes may be equipped. Many of the cards include zombie movie tropes to achieve a feel of playing out a horror movie. All the game art is photographic, enhancing the cinematic feel. The game also comes with a CD soundtrack of original thematic music.&#10;&#10;Each hero has its own plastic sculpted miniature. The game also has 14 zombies in two colors. Other objects and effects are represented by high-quality cardboard counters.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	6	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/jseUQXzKFKPPSUV_SB1YAg__original/img/c6pFkS-dVLo41OHpzbY6u8MJpok=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic6974555.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/jseUQXzKFKPPSUV_SB1YAg__thumb/img/BfM6xzLaZNYQJelq64mZfLi56iY=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6974555.jpg
934	1041	San Marco	Players are attempting to score the most points by building up influence in the districts of Venice via their aristocrats. The game uses a card distribution mechanic whereby (in the case of a four-player game) two players draw cards and divide them up into two piles each, the other two players pick one group and the remaining groups go to the players who formed the groups. The action cards allow players to place and remove aristocrats, erect and move bridges, and score individual regions. The entire game lasts three Passages and each Passage may contain several turns.&#10;&#10;62 Action cards:&#10;   30 District (5 for each district)&#10;    6 Bridge&#10;   12 Transfer&#10;   10 Doge&#10;    4 Banishment&#10;&#10;28 Limit cards:&#10;   8 X &quot;1&quot;&#10;   10 X &quot;2&quot;&#10;   10 X &quot;3&quot;&#10;&#10;Related game:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Canal Grande is a two-player card game based on this game.&#10;&#10;&#10;	\N	3	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/naR9J06D478NUxl07EMnlw__original/img/bmmoH7XTfp31bX5jjcdg9S6rlto=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic174180.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/naR9J06D478NUxl07EMnlw__thumb/img/qKnIyPAN1onf5dlPcaJ9Z2AxbSg=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic174180.jpg
935	98229	Pictomania	Pictomania is a drawing game in which everyone is both drawing and guessing at the same time, giving a chance for those who excel only at one or the other skill to crush the dreams of other players.&#10;&#10;Pictomania lasts five rounds, and at the start of each round, you set up six randomly drawn cards on card racks visible to all players. Cards are double-sided, come in four levels of difficulty, and include seven related words on a single side. In addition to a set of guessing cards, scoring tokens, marker and drawing board, each player receives one symbol card and one number card, which together indicate which word or phrase on the revealed cards that player must draw. Bonus tokens equal to one less than the number of players are placed in the center of the table.&#10;&#10;Players simultaneously look at their cards and start to draw. While drawing, they can also watch what others are doing and place a guess card on that player's stack. Only one guess per player is allowed, and once you make a guess, you can't change your mind. Other players will ideally be playing guess cards on your stack, too. Once you have finished drawing and guessing &ndash; and you're not required to do either &ndash; take the highest-valued bonus token from the center of the table and take no other actions. Once the final bonus token is claimed, the round ends.&#10;&#10;One by one, players reveal what they were drawing and the guesses that others made. Those who guess your word earn one of your scoring tokens, with early guessers earning more points, while those who guess incorrectly have their card placed in the center of the table. Once all the guesses are resolved, you determine the black sheep &ndash; the player who made the worst guesses. If a single player has more cards in the center of the table than anyone else, then his bonus token (if any) counts as negative points. What's more, if no one guessed your word, then you throw away your bonus token, scoring nothing for it. You sum positive points for the round (a bonus token scored, and scoring tokens from the words you guessed correctly), then subtract points for the black sheep &quot;bonus&quot; and all the scoring tokens you didn't give away to determine your final score for the round, which could be negative.&#10;&#10;Reset the bonus and scoring tokens, set up six new cards, hand out the symbol and number cards and start another round. The player with the highest score after five rounds wins.&#10;&#10;	\N	3	6	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/0m0X8qZxfARpz0lmzjxSEw__original/img/Pmg6ToAhHrfbccB29JaN0emETec=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic2360788.png	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/0m0X8qZxfARpz0lmzjxSEw__thumb/img/swi0YmUUKWTu54c8XN1NlsawYuQ=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2360788.png
936	35570	Tinners' Trail	Tinners' Trail is set in nineteenth century Cornwall. You are mining for copper and tin, attempting to sell when the prices are high. To reduce the cost of mining you can place developments, such as ports, adits, and trains.

937	249277	Brazil: Imperial	Take on the role of one of the great monarchs of the past, and show your valor! You will arrive in a vast and rich territory, but the road to the prosperity is filled with challenges.&#10;&#10;In Brazil: Imperial, you need to construct buildings, manage resources, explore the land, create trade, acquire the support of the greatest personalities of the country, and recruit a powerful army to protect your interest against the rival states. If you make the right choices, you can complete missions to progress to a more advanced era, receiving new interesting options of development and victory points. In the end, the best monarch receives the title of Brazilian Emperor and constructs a new era of prosperity, freedom and peace!&#10;&#10;In more detail, while playing in a modular map board that recreate real regions, you use a combination of worker placement, area majority, and individual powers to construct an empire in Brazil between the 16th and 19th centuries. You start by choosing one of the available monarchs and its personal game board and components; some monarchs are strong in combat, while others prioritize science or exploration. You receive tasks that advance you to a new era when you complete them, giving you access to more power constructions as you move into the second and third eras of the game, then you choose a starting point on the shared map.&#10;&#10;On each turn, you can participate in an action phase and a movement phase. You manage actions on your individual game board, and you have these seven choices:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Deploy: Summon one military unit to explore and defend your territory.&#10;    Frame: Buy cards that represent famous historic figures to receive special powers and victory points.&#10;    Build: Construct farms, mines, cities, and other structures to generate resources and do other things.&#10;    Renovate: Overhaul an old building to produce new resources.&#10;    Manufacture: Produce basic resources &mdash; wood, sugar cane, cotton, or coffee &mdash; to receive victory points, improve your &quot;action arches&quot;, and have raw material for more valuable products.&#10;    Harbor: Go to the port to receive a small amount of basic resources.&#10;    Trade: Sell your basic resources to receive gold and special cards to improve your empire.&#10;&#10;&#10;During the movement phase, you can explore hidden places or attack other players. For combat, you check the power of the troops involved in the conflict to determine the winner, with cards being able to modify these values. Once a player completes their goals in the third era, the game ends and players tally their scores.&#10;&#10;Brazil: Imperial was developed with the concept of it being &quot;Euro X&quot;, a new style of game that combines Eurogames (in which you collect and manage resources) and 4x games (in which you explore, expand, exploit and exterminate). A new concept of maps was also introduced in this game. All maps are different and created with modular boards that recreate real regions of Brazil and the world. Each game you can focus on resource management, combat, or a combination of both, depending on your choice of monarch and the interaction with other players.&#10;&#10;	\N	1	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/KuiDNcMdWaeDe5_-rISFRQ__original/img/lLQh6xW5n-SW9LNNMiSloEh3XUM=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic6222695.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/KuiDNcMdWaeDe5_-rISFRQ__thumb/img/Mfht3Q1IcjyVG8A2fdDBP--MWf8=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6222695.jpg
938	173	Formula Dé	Formula D&eacute; is a fast-paced racing game in which the cars' top speeds are limited by having to end a certain number of turns in each curve of the racetrack.  This can be tricky, because although players can regulate their speeds by choosing which gear to be in and each gear allows a certain range of movement, the exact amount is determined randomly.   Great fun for a big group.&#10;&#10;A winner of the 1990 Concours International de Cr&#195;&#169;ateurs de Jeux de Soci&#195;&#169;t&#195;&#169;.&#10;&#10;Expanded by: (Ludod&#195;&#169;lire Expansions)&#10;&#10;    Formule D&#195;&#169; Circuit &#226;&#132;&#150; 1: Grand Prix de MONACO  (included in french edition)&#10;    Formule D&#195;&#169; Circuit &#226;&#132;&#150; 2: FRANCE &#226;&#128;&#147; Circuit de Nevers Magny-Cours&#10;    Formule D&#195;&#169; Circuit &#226;&#132;&#150; 3: GRAN PREMO D'ITALIA &#226;&#128;&#147; Autodromo Nazionale Monza&#10;    Formule D&#195;&#169; Circuit &#226;&#132;&#150; 4: GROSSER PREIS VON DEUTSCHLAND &#226;&#128;&#147; Hockenheim Ring  (included in german edition)&#10;    Formule D&#195;&#169; Circuit &#226;&#132;&#150; 5: GRAND PRIX DE BELGIQUE &#226;&#128;&#147; Circuit de Spa &#226;&#128;&#147; Francorchamps&#10;    Formule D&#195;&#169; Circuit &#226;&#132;&#150; 6: GRANDE PREMIO DE PORTUGAL &#226;&#128;&#147; Circuito do Estoril&#10;    Formule D&#195;&#169; Circuit &#226;&#132;&#150; 7: BRITISH GRAND PRIX &#226;&#128;&#147; Silverstone Circuit  (included in british edition)&#10;    Formule D&#195;&#169; Circuit &#226;&#132;&#150; 8: GRAN PREMIO DE ESPA&#195;&#145;A &#226;&#128;&#147; Circuit de Catalunya&#10;    Formule D&#195;&#169; Circuit &#9;&#226;&#132;&#150; 9: GRAND PRIX DU CANADA &#226;&#128;&#147; Circuit Gilles Villeneuve&#10;    Formule D&#195;&#169; Circuit &#9;&#226;&#132;&#150; 10: GRANDE PREMIO DE BRASIL &#226;&#128;&#147; Circuito do Interlagos&#10;    Formule D&#195;&#169; Circuit &#226;&#132;&#150; 11: JAPAN GRAND PRIX &#226;&#128;&#147; Suzuka Circuit&#10;    Formule D&#195;&#169; Circuit &#226;&#132;&#150; 12: SOUTH of AFRICA GRAND PRIX &#226;&#128;&#147; Kyalami Circuit&#10;    Formule D&#195;&#169; Circuit &#226;&#132;&#150; 13: SAN MARINO &#226;&#128;&#147; Autodromo Enzo & Dino Ferrari&#10;    Formule D&#195;&#169;: World Championship&#10;&#10;&#10;Expanded by: (Descartes Editeur Expansions)&#10;&#10;    Formula D&#195;&#169; Circuits 1 & 2: Monaco & Zandvoort 1   (plans were included in base game)&#10;    Formula D&#195;&#169; Circuits 3 & 4: Zandvoort 2 & SPA-Francorchamps&#10;    Formula D&#195;&#169; Circuits 5 & 6: Kyalami & Ferrari Autodromo&#10;    Formula D&#195;&#169; Circuits 7 & 8: Magny-Cours & Monza&#10;    Formula D&#195;&#169; Circuits 9 & 10: Estoril & Interlagos&#10;    Formula D&#195;&#169; Circuits 11 & 12: Watkins Glen & Silverstone&#10;    Formula D&#195;&#169; Circuits 13 & 14: Montreal & Long Beach&#10;    Formula D&#195;&#169; Circuits 15 & 16: Hockenheim & Zeltweg&#10;    Formula D&#195;&#169; Circuits 17 & 18: Buenos-Aires & Barcelona&#10;    Formula D&#195;&#169; Circuits 19 & 20: Suzuka & Melbourne&#10;    Formula D&#195;&#169; Circuits 21 & 22: Budapest & N&#195;&#188;rburgring&#10;    Formula D&#195;&#169; Circuits 23 - 26: USA Track Pack #1&#10;    Formula D&#195;&#169; Circuits 27 - 30: USA Track Pack #2&#10;    Formula D&#195;&#169; Circuits 31 & 32: Zhuhai & Sepang&#10;    Formula D&#195;&#169; Circuit 33: 10th Anniversary&#10;    Formula D&#195;&#169; Circuits 34 & 35: Bahrain & Shanghai&#10;&#10;&#10;Expanded by: (Asmodee Expansions)&#10;&#10;    Formula D: The "Shortcut"&#10;    Formula D: Circuits 1 &#226;&#128;&#147; Sebring & Chicago&#10;    Formula D: Circuits 2 &#226;&#128;&#147; Hockenheim and Valencia&#10;    Formula D: Circuits 3 &#226;&#128;&#147; Singapore & The Docks&#10;    Formula D: Circuits 4 &#226;&#128;&#147; Grand Prix of Baltimore & Buddh&#10;    Formula D: Circuits 5 &#226;&#128;&#147; New Jersey & Sotchi&#10;    Formula D: Circuits 6 &#226;&#128;&#147; Austin & Nevada Ride&#10;&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;    Formula D&#195;&#169; Mini&#10;    Formula D&#10;&#10;&#10;	\N	2	10	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/S6Jrqf7MeqiueJI1uuqgcw__original/img/wacVVrR-MrBG5suNiry_9fPPbwk=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic168167.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/S6Jrqf7MeqiueJI1uuqgcw__thumb/img/731_1UDPU0q4RWrMgDP9JLzrZRM=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic168167.jpg
939	329465	Red Rising	Enter the futuristic universe of Red Rising, based on the book series by Pierce Brown featuring a dystopian society divided into fourteen castes. You represent a house attempting to rise to power as you piece together an assortment of followers (represented by your hand of cards). Will you break the chains of the Society or embrace the dominance of the Golds?&#10;&#10;Red Rising is a hand-management, combo-building game for 1-6 players (45-60 minute playing time). You start with a hand of 5 cards, and on your turn you will deploy 1 of those cards to a location on the board, activating that card&rsquo;s deploy benefit. You will then gain the top card from another location (face up) or the deck (face down), gaining that location's benefit and adding the card to your hand as you enhance your end-game point total. If at any point you&rsquo;re really happy with your hand, you can instead use your turn to reveal a card from the top of the deck and place it on a location to gain that location&rsquo;s benefit.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;	\N	1	6	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/V6QEXXgRgz3urOrRVZ_1zA__original/img/Gp9hIVv-zRxlkrO5Pmg3aXb4P1M=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5960554.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/V6QEXXgRgz3urOrRVZ_1zA__thumb/img/8zjF-E9xPNYLSsI6xQjRsZiI-XE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5960554.jpg
940	904	Nightmare Productions	Reiner Knizia's auction game about producing movies. In four rounds, players bid on chips representing genuine directors, actors, camera, effects, music, guest stars and agents (or in Nightmare Productions edition: creatures, locations, directors, musical conductors, cameos, and contractors). These all get placed on players' film-strips to complete the movie production. So one movie might need 2 actors (in editions prior to Nightmare Productions), but no music or effects and so on. As films are completed, the points value is marked and another film-strip taken. There are two parties (in Nightmare Productions edition: horror cons) each round where players get to pick from offers without paying anything. There are bonus points for first films completed and best films, best directors (in Nightmare Productions edition: best creatures), even worst film.&#10;&#10;The auction is a basic rising offer with passing until one winning bid remains. Players pay into the pot with contracts (in Nightmare Productions edition: money), and the rest of the players share the pot each turn. So it's a closed economy with players trying to time to bid on what they really need to complete films.&#10;&#10;See Movie Comparison - Traumfabrik for listings of movies and actors in each version prior to Nightmare Productions edition.&#10;&#10;Note: There have been many editions of the game under varying names. All are identical except for Nightmare Productions edition which has introduced a few changes.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	5	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/1elpLCAJcRmWtPVZy2gFaA__original/img/_GYbqQtZAlmIFMOht2Dk_Qq2Pto=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic6926823.png	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/1elpLCAJcRmWtPVZy2gFaA__thumb/img/MKD7eO1i3GjyskxROM6boEOjq0o=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6926823.png
941	245643	Luxor	On the hunt for priceless treasures, groups of adventurers explore the legendary temple at Luxor. Their ultimate goal is the tomb of the pharaoh, but many treasures can be collected as they search. As they explore, the challenge unfolds: The player who manages to quickly get their team of adventurers to the tomb, while salvaging as many treasures as possible, will be the winner.&#10;&#10;Luxor offers variable game play as the path that leads to the tomb is different for every game &mdash; and will even change during play!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;In Luxor, players move their adventurers through the temple with the goal of reaching the tomb in the middle of the game board. At the start of the game each player gets dealt 5 cards, which he is not allowed to change the order of.&#10;&#10;In each round players take turns that consist of 3 actions:&#10;&#10;1. Choose either the left or right most card to play to the discard pile.&#10;&#10;According to the played card move, one adventurer that many tiles forward towards the tomb. An adventurer only moves from tile to tile, jumping over empty spaces and not counting them.&#10;&#10;2. When the adventurer has completed his movement, he performs the action of that tile, if possible. Depending on the tile this can have various effects:&#10;&#10;Treasure tile - If enough of a players adventurers player are placed on a tile, the player can collect that tile and earn points for it. Additionally he keeps the tile, trying to collect treasure sets consisting of the three different treasure kinds, vase, statue and necklace.&#10;&#10;Horus tile - The player can either gain a key or a Horus Card. He will need the key to enter the tomb and the special Horus card offers unique and strong ways to move his adventurers once he plays that card.&#10;&#10;Osiris tile - The tile acts as an catapult instantly moving the adventurer a certain amount of tiles forward.&#10;&#10;Temple tile - On these tiles players get special bonuses, like scarabs that are worth victory points or joker tiles, which complete treasure sets. The most unique tile is the tunnel. If an adventurer lands on a tunnel he instantly gets teleported to the next tunnel in play, creating a shortcut through the temple.&#10;&#10;3. After performing the action of the tile, players draw one card from the draw pile to refill their hand to five cards. The drawn card is placed in the middle of the hand.&#10;&#10;At the start of the game, players can chose to move one of 2 adventurers. Every time an adventurer crosses over an Anubis statue for the first time he gains a new adventurer which is placed at the start.&#10;&#10;The game ends once two adventurers reach the tomb. But in order to get in the tomb and collect the valuable sarcophagi, players need to have a key, which they collect from landing on Horus tiles. One key is needed for each adventurer wanting to enter the tomb.&#10;&#10;The round is finished and then the game ends with a final scoring.&#10;&#10;The player who now has the most points is the winner!&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/C9nhhIS2zRuneMt0FBK1zg__original/img/lUDrmhc8SXxr6zn8dLuS3uIhT4g=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3955965.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/C9nhhIS2zRuneMt0FBK1zg__thumb/img/Ugc6cGHhvETu-EUYAKy03sXJmJM=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3955965.jpg
942	177678	Signorie	Italy during the 15th century was a country full of intrigue and magnificence. The tumultuous political conditions created the perfect breeding ground for the birth of a new form of government (called Signoria) and the rise of the most ambitious noble families. After having acted in the dark for a long time, the time has finally come for them to take control of the cities and shape Italy&rsquo;s future. Their stories will go down in history.&#10;&#10;In Signorie, you will play the role of a Signore, a Lord of one of the most prestigious families of the Renaissance. One at the time, players choose one die from a common pool. (Twenty dice in five colors are rolled at the beginning of each round.) You place it on your player board (your city) and perform one of the possible actions. The color of the chosen die determines the action, and the number on the die is a discount on the cost of the action.&#10;&#10;During a round, each player can perform up to four actions. At the end of the round, if the sum of a player's chosen dice is equal or lower than 13, he can obtain a reward.&#10;&#10;The dice mechanism is easy and innovative and gives players a simple, but challenging choice. Money is always tight, so there is a temptation to choose a high valued dice, but that needs to be balanced with obtaining the reward.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Nq7RZa78giIv6IdfPWCMvQ__original/img/Yu4EM1Xl6KgxdSrrROspBLMKn3U=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2684003.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Nq7RZa78giIv6IdfPWCMvQ__thumb/img/-CUyKUt1lFJjpivhset1eX0Swso=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2684003.jpg
943	223953	Kitchen Rush	You've just inherited an old restaurant and you must turn it into a successful business! Hire personnel, order the right ingredients and be ready to serve the customers that enter your restaurant. The success will depend entirely on your efficiency in the kitchen!&#10;&#10;Kitchen Rush is an innovative real-time cooperative game that simulates the excitement of a high-pressure kitchen environment. It does so through worker placement, using hourglasses as your workers. These hourglasses are used to take orders from customers, prepare their dishes, serve them on time, buy groceries, clean plates and make sure enough money is made each round to cover wages, expenses, upgrades and hopefully, leave a profit. Any worker placed on an action space may not be used elsewhere before the sand within the hourglass runs out, making each decision important as time is limited.&#10;&#10;The game is for 1-4 players and plays for 4 rounds of 4 minutes. The fun, excitement and rush it brings to the table offers a full course for gamers and family members alike.&#10;&#10;	\N	1	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/tNhxjR4AzMPY9WxOPS-gZQ__original/img/tR_u2HNo6QaTrGxqcuJ7-MeUWXA=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3559531.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/tNhxjR4AzMPY9WxOPS-gZQ__thumb/img/Urs4Wd-AgM0sbY-rlD_dFJeOdZs=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3559531.jpg

It won't be an easy task, as players compete for precious resources such as malt, yeast, fruit and spices in the local markets, all while managing and optimizing their growing bottling empires.&#10;&#10;In Brew Crafters, players assume management of a local craft brewery, working hard to manage resources, use their workers wisely, and develop their brewing line to create the best local brews.

Each brewery has access to a variety of equipment upgrades, local farms, markets, and a plethora of specialty workers, ensuring a high level of replayability and strategic avenues. In addition, each player is studiously working to be first to develop several rotating gold-label specialty recipes that will earn them extra points and prestige at the end of year three when the best local brewer will be honored.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	5	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/NAeItcDkAqhXVAe0ogT4yw__original/img/mKXBLJmeM638RFzxFEp22NZ1oP8=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1601585.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/NAeItcDkAqhXVAe0ogT4yw__thumb/img/KCdHyS3dTyV9jc94S6eOupdcgVs=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1601585.jpg

946	231218	Black Sonata	For more than four centuries scholars have argued over the identity of the mysterious Dark Lady of William Shakespeare's sonnets. According to the sonnets, the Dark Lady seduced the poet and held him in an agonised thrall while also conducting an affair with the Fair Youth whom Shakespeare also loved.&#10;&#10;In Black Sonata you will find yourself in Shakespeare's London, circa 1600, in pursuit of the shadowy Lady. A specially ordered deck of cards determines her hidden movements from place to place. You must deduce her location and then intercept her to catch a glimpse and gain a clue to her identity. You will need several clues to deduce her identity, but with each clue gained the Lady becomes harder to track. Black Sonata combines hidden movement and logical deduction into a unique solitaire steeped in literary history.&#10;&#10;Can you finally solve English literature's greatest mystery?

Choose one player to be the round's chief. That player gives all players a random card numbered 1-10, then they read one of the five hundred theme cards included in the game, e.g., &quot;Batman wants to replace Robin to fight the bad guys. Create a new duo 'Batman and ...' from the worst to the best.&quot; The chief looks at their number, then gives an answer based on their number. If they have a 1, they want to give the worst possible suggestion; if a 10, the best; if a 5-7, somewhere in the middle.&#10;&#10;Each other player then gives an answer to this theme based on the number they were dealt, then the chief needs to decide who has the lowest number, then the next lowest, and so on. For each mistake, the chief flips a unicorn token over to its poop side.&#10;&#10;If all the unicorns have left by the end of the fifth round, leaving you with nothing but poop, then you lose.

950	238992	Call to Adventure	Make your fate! Inspired by character-driven fantasy storytelling, Call to Adventure challenges 1-4 players to create the hero with the greatest destiny by acquiring traits, facing challenges, and overcoming adversaries.&#10;&#10;Call to Adventure features a unique &quot;rune rolling&quot; system for resolving challenges, a point-based system that encourages storytelling, and over 150 unique cards. Players begin each game with an origin card that provides their backstory as well as two &quot;starter&quot; abilities. Each round they may either acquire trait cards from the board or face a challenge. Challenges each have two possible paths a player can choose from. For example, players who encounter the Thieves' Guild may choose to train as a spy, or train as a killer. Each challenge has a difficulty that must be overcome by rolling successes on carved runes. The more a player has of the abilities required to overcome the challenge, the more runes they will be able to cast.&#10;&#10;Failed challenges lead players to acquire experience points that may be spent to &quot;push&quot; through tougher challenges. But beware, while some negative experiences will help your hero grow, too many tragedies set them on a dark path.&#10;&#10;As players' heroes grow in ability and experience, they move on to harder challenges, eventually facing deadly adversaries and acquiring more and more destiny points. The player whose hero has the highest destiny score wins the game.&#10;&#10;	\N	1	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/oz_C4Hwf1Hb6KHt6KTxJJA__original/img/0Yr5q3uSGhilPz2dYe3k2rqFO9Q=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4165094.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/oz_C4Hwf1Hb6KHt6KTxJJA__thumb/img/WKPD4ypqNftdXn2L3q4aPM8UXh0=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4165094.jpg

Gameplay is divided into two acts &mdash; Amity Island and The Orca &mdash; played on a double-sided board to replicate the film's story:&#10;&#10;&#10;    In the Amity Island phase, the shark menaces swimmers and avoids capture. Other players attempt to pinpoint the shark's location and save swimmers from shark attacks.&#10;    In the Orca phase, played on the reverse side of the game board, Brody, Hooper and Quint are aboard the sinking ship engaging in a climactic battle against the shark, while using additional action and strategy cards to defend the Orca from targeted shark attacks.&#10;&#10;&#10;If humans kill the shark, they win; if the shark attack on the Orca succeeds, the great white shark wins.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/UDv2zsY1rdWVOXyUl8faYg__original/img/XwsKpy2zpnujG6zXd959_Ts5hKE=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4581181.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/UDv2zsY1rdWVOXyUl8faYg__thumb/img/gOOR7Q9EdwxdjB9t2kgS1HFBs-0=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4581181.jpg

954	9440	Maharaja: The Game of Palace Building in India	A board game for two to five players with elements of area control and simultaneous action selection. During the game, the players take different roles and travel from city to city in India. Their architects build palaces and houses for the Maharadja.&#10;&#10;Of course, building a palace is expensive. Therefore, it is important to earn enough money in the cities.  The first player who builds seven palaces is the winner.&#10;&#10;Players choose their actions simultaneously, but reveal and resolve them in turn. Actions include generating money, building houses or palaces, manipulating the Maharaja's movements, and choosing new architects (each architect has a unique power, but the more powerful ones come further down the turn order).&#10;&#10;At the end of each round, the Maharaja scores the city he is currently in based on the number of buildings, and players receive money accordingly. He then moves to a new city.&#10;&#10;Besides the basic game, the rules booklet contains two advanced versions for players who seek even more depth in their game play.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	5	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/BPJDeSSatiiw1eTAnxx5-g__original/img/f1QHn7vc8bdpjBkZU_q1I132scs=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic44952.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/BPJDeSSatiiw1eTAnxx5-g__thumb/img/Lslbt68cs39OKA2XO0idRyjEG1Q=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic44952.jpg
955	148319	Tragedy Looper	Tragedy Looper is a scenario-based deduction game for two to four players: one mastermind and one to three protagonists. The game consists of four location boards and a number of character cards. Each scenario features a number of characters, hidden roles for these characters (serial killer, conspiracy theorist, friend), and some pre-set tragedies (murder, suicide).&#10;&#10;Each &quot;day&quot; (turn), players and the mastermind play three face-down cards onto the characters, then reveal them to move the characters around or affect their paranoia or goodwill stats. At the end of each day (turn), if the scenario has a tragedy set for that day, it happens if the conditions are met, i.e., certain characters have certain stats or are in a certain location together (or not together) with others. As tragedies happen, players loop back in time, restarting the scenario from the beginning and trying to deduce who the culprit was and why the tragedy occurred.&#10;&#10;The players win if they manage to maintain status quo &mdash; that is, if no tragedies occur to the key individuals &mdash; for a set number of days, within a set number of loops. If not, the mastermind wins.&#10;&#10;Tragedy Looper was originally released in Japan as &#230;&#131;&#168;&#229;&#138;&#135;RoopeR in 2011; the first english version of the game was released in 2014.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/fsUCwhRp_5knh6eY8EduTw__original/img/FgUk3tNrF0_ryLIT3S0nnZUY8iE=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic2046290.png	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/fsUCwhRp_5knh6eY8EduTw__thumb/img/_mkrhR0iN7QX5e1LhsPtDbhXhMo=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2046290.png
956	2181	Bridge	Bridge is a standard deck, trick taking card game that pits two partnerships against each other. The first part of the game is the auction, by which partners attempt to communicate information about their hands by bidding, in order to arrive at a successful contract. The contract specifies how many tricks must be taken by the team that wins the bid. After the auction, a member of the team that won the bid tries to win as many tricks as possible while playing both hands from the partnership. One hand is played normally while the other (the &quot;dummy hand&quot;) is placed face-up on the table, allowing for greater control. The defenders attempt to take enough tricks to make the contract fail.&#10;&#10;The formal name of the game is Contract Bridge, but the shortened name &quot;Bridge&quot; is the most common usage. Bridge developed from the 17th Century card game Whist. The earliest form of Bridge originated in 1886 when rules were introduced allowing the dealer to choose a trump and their partner's hand to become dummy. Bridge became Auction Bridge in 1904, which allowed the trump suit to be decided by the highest bidding partnership. Harold Vanderbilt transformed Auction Bridge into Contract Bridge in 1925, when he introduced an improved method of scoring.&#10;&#10;The duplicate version of the game has many pairs of partners, each playing the same hands separately and comparing their results. This method removes the element of luck in getting good cards when comparing players and thus helps to isolate the role of skill in the game.&#10;&#10;	\N	4	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/T6X1-I6St8OW50bhewvL3A__original/img/PeWeYPgj5qqjbf1ToP_YXAFXT5A=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1273353.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/T6X1-I6St8OW50bhewvL3A__thumb/img/zqCqSXlCc4ZFzEHwMY5rYzI2dnM=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1273353.jpg
957	26566	Homesteaders	Homesteaders is an auction and resource management game in which players bid on the opportunity to build certain types of buildings, then spend resource cubes to build one of several buildings of that type. The buildings confer abilities, income, and points; some automatically and some requiring a worker.&#10;&#10;The game lasts ten rounds, with each round consisting of an auction phase followed by a building phase. After the last round, players take one final income phase and have one last chance to buy and sell goods and use their building abilities before scores are tallied.&#10;&#10;Players score for their buildings, bonuses conferred by buildings, and points earned throughout the game from selling resource cubes. The player who builds the best combination of buildings and best manages the nine different resources in the game will score the most points and win &ndash; as long as they don't take on too much debt!&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/i61Apbaaj_qvSt0-7NBvag__original/img/byq85D2igqTd0xYwv63hYPXU9AI=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1113708.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/i61Apbaaj_qvSt0-7NBvag__thumb/img/rseIP1ezqnea3sEsT93vZHdjNaw=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1113708.jpg

Decorate the palace lake with floating lanterns and compete to become the most honored artisan when the festival begins.&#10;&#10;In Lanterns: The Harvest Festival, players have a hand of tiles depicting various color arrangements of floating lanterns, as well as an inventory of individual lantern cards of specific colors. When you place a tile, all players (you and your opponents) receive a lantern card corresponding to the color on the side of the tile facing them. Place carefully to earn cards and other bonuses for yourself, while also looking to deny your opponents. Players gain honor by dedicating sets of lantern cards &mdash; three pairs, for example, or all seven colors &mdash; and the player with the most honor at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/JmY4nVWwW98qEn0NRbKdTw__original/img/a5OqnY-e8hhVO1IHp6wZKnXHWlY=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic2372790.png	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/JmY4nVWwW98qEn0NRbKdTw__thumb/img/qQuRUZQAineOCl4abLvZgPjnqTE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2372790.png
959	41066	Virgin Queen	from GMT website:&#10;&#10;Virgin Queen: Wars of Religion 1559-1598 is a game of grand strategy for two to six players based on the military, political and religious conflicts within Europe during the reigns of Elizabeth I of England and Philip II of Spain. Each player controls one or more of the major powers that presided over European politics in that day. Spain is the juggernaut, able to draw upon the vast riches of their global empire. But such a dominant power is sure to have many enemies. The Ottoman expansion towards Spain's Mediterranean outposts remains unchecked. Elizabeth's English sea dogs are poised to raid Spain's overseas empire. And the forces of Protestant reform will soon drag Spain into eighty years of rebellion in the Netherlands. Will Spain find aid from its Catholic allies? Perhaps not from France, where the Catholic Valois dynasty is soon to engage another group of Protestant believers in the bloody French Wars of Religion. And even Philip's relatives in Vienna who rule the Holy Roman Empire may dabble in the Protestant faith instead of remaining loyal to their Catholic heritage and Spanish brethren.&#10;&#10;The six powers in Virgin Queen are:&#10;&#10;     Ottoman&#10;     Spain&#10;     England&#10;     France&#10;     Holy Roman Empire&#10;     Protestants (Dutch &amp; Huguenots)&#10;&#10;&#10;Virgin Queen: Wars of Religion 1559-1598 is the sequel to Here I Stand, another card-driven game of grand strategy that covered the previous forty years (from Martin Luther's posting of his 95 Theses in 1517 through the abdication of Charles V in 1556). Players familiar with Here I Stand will find much that is familiar in Virgin Queen as over half of the rule book remains unchanged. New game systems have been put in place to emphasize the changing nature of the conflicts here in the late 16th Century:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Religion: Streamlined from Here I Stand, the new rules for religious conversion and rebellion allow actions to be resolved quickly, reflecting the already entrenched presence of both Catholic and Protestant factions across the key areas of religious struggle.&#10;     World Map: Oceanic expeditions are now under direct player control as they sail to the Caribbean and beyond to seize plunder, found colonies, and attempt to circumnavigate the globe.&#10;     Diplomatic Influence: Alliances with minor powers (and major powers that can be activated in games with fewer than six players) are now made through a unified system where players buy influence at each of these foreign courts.&#10;     Weddings: Here I Stand&rsquo;s secret negotiation phase is still present here in Virgin Queen, but with a new twist. Now you will want to arrange marriages for each of the princes and princesses of your family dynasty with a suitable foreign royal. Will even the Virgin Queen succumb to love and take a husband, or will she jilt that suitor at the last minute once again?&#10;     Patronage: Your royal court will be visited by artists, writers, scientists, and architects, who all want you to invest in their endeavors for the glory and advancement of the realm. Will you sponsor Galileo, Cervantes, or Shakespeare or instead spend your treasury on a fruitless quest for the Philosopher's Stone?&#10;     Espionage: Beware, there is also a dark side to this period &ndash; a time of espionage and spymasters. In Virgin Queen you can ask your ambassadors to spy on foreign courts, send out handgun-armed assassins, invest in cryptology, and even recruit Jesuit priests for undercover missions of conversion. &#10;&#10;&#10;There are several different scenarios included allowing your play sessions to be tailored to the number of players and time available:&#10;&#10;     Two-Player Tutorial: Great for new players just learning the series, this 90-minute game pits the Ottomans against Spain during the time of the Siege of Malta and Battle of Lepanto. Uses a subset of the full rules so you can dive in quickly.&#10;     Campaign Scenario: The full Virgin Queen experience, this eight-hour game can last up to seven turns and is normally played with from 4 to six players. Variant rules allow you to play with just two or three players if desired.&#10;     Armada Scenario: A quicker game focused on Turns 3 to 6 of the full campaign, this 4 to 5-hour game is ideal for tournament play. Once again supports from 4 to 6 players.&#10;&#10;&#10;	\N	2	6	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/-YgoNoqHXqA4N_4qaxUUeQ__original/img/1PSNe-YTGUbXvPO5I0BZ41laFXA=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1276971.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/-YgoNoqHXqA4N_4qaxUUeQ__thumb/img/5LjNGVusukBqx7gXFljokCe3tmI=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1276971.jpg
960	172047	The Others	In The Others, the world stands on the brink of apocalypse, as the fanatics of the Hell Club have summoned the 7 Deadly Sins to lay waste to our reality. Slowly the Others have creeped into our lives, corrupting society from within. The city of Haven is the key to their invasion, but it will not go down without a fight, thanks to the actions of the paranormal organization known as F.A.I.T.H. (Federal Authority for the Interdiction of Transdimensional Horrors). Each session of The Others is played with one player controlling the forces of a single Sin, against the other players who control a team of 7 FAITH heroes. The heroes cooperate to survive the Sin's attacks and accomplish the missions set before them, while the Sin attempts to thwart the heroes in all ways (preferably by destroying them).&#10;&#10;The heroes are divided into different classes, each specialized in a different aspect of the game. Leaders are good at helping the other members of the team. Bruisers are excellent melee fighters. Snipers are experts at using guns to put down monsters from a distance. And Fixers have the resourcefulness and knowledge of the occult necessary to resolve supernatural crises that spread through the city. Each hero also has their own stats and unique abilities that set them apart from all others. Knowing when to bring in the right reinforcement can be key to FAITH&rsquo;s victory.&#10;&#10;Corruption is one of the main mechanics of the game. It is both a way for the Sin to consume heroes, and a way for heroes to accomplish amazing feats they wouldn&rsquo;t be capable of normally. Taking corruption grants heroes powerful bonuses (as long as they keep taking corruption), but when they become fully corrupted, their darkest secrets may come back to haunt them and tear the team from within, or their flesh might simply succumb to the sinful influences.&#10;&#10;The Sins player, on the other hand, has access to the different monsters of each Sin, including Abominations, a Controller, and the terrifying Avatar of Sin! These monsters can attempt to destroy the heroes, or simply hinder their progress on their missions. Each Sin provides the Sins Player with a different deck of Sins cards that can be played at different times to surprise players with different effects, often tied to the strategy of each Sin. Yes, because each Sin taints the game with an overarching mechanic that is always in effect. For example, Pride punishes prideful heroes that venture into the streets on their own, while Sloth punishes heroes who try to move quickly across the board. Heroes will need to learn to deal with the different influence of each Sin, which will always stand between them and their mission.&#10;&#10;The Sins are also aided by Acolytes, with each session using a different type. These lowly corrupted servants of darkness can fight and stand in the way of heroes, but they also have a once per round special ability that reflects their previous lives. For example, corrupted hobos take equipment from heroes, corrupted nuns corrupt the city districts, and corrupted doctors keep heroes from healing.&#10;&#10;There are 7 different stories that players can embark on for each session of The Others. Each of them brings different special rules, different dynamics, and a unique system of branching missions the heroes need to accomplish in order to be victorious. There are Terror stories, which are more straightforward, focusing on action and combat; Corruption stories revolve around the Corruption spreading through the city and the heroes themselves; and Redemption stories rely on saving the city and the few innocents that remain. Each story can be played on a different map setup, which further makes the dynamic of each session unique.&#10;&#10;The board used in The Others is made up of several tiles, each depicting a different city district and different configurations of streets. As the city of Haven still belongs to humanity, and it&rsquo;s the Sins that are attempting to take it over, the heroes can use it to get different benefits each district offers them. For example, they can go to the hospital to heal wounds, to the museum to get rid of corruption, to the RavenCorp tower to get new equipment, or to the police station to call in an orbital strike. What districts are available on each map, and their location, can greatly change the dynamic of the game.&#10;&#10;As the game progresses, and depending on how badly the heroes fare against storyline plot twists and developments, the Apocalypse Track will advance, making the Sins gradually stronger and more terrifying. Apocalypse cards, tied to the type of story being played (Terror, Corruption, or Redemption) introduce new twists and challenges to the game, even bringing in the members of the Hell Club themselves!&#10;&#10;Heroes will die. Either in noble sacrifice, torn apart by claws and tentacles, or consumed by the corruption welling up in their souls. The question is whether the FAITH team will manage to fulfill their final mission in time, or whether the Sins will reign supreme over humanity.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;	\N	2	5	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/5VrDj4hKFp-jqyl8Fpwjjw__original/img/bLc9FSgvlDLpvSRuXut_6uQGE08=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2642988.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/5VrDj4hKFp-jqyl8Fpwjjw__thumb/img/9CaYE5MphaFkBYcFHTkY1Z_JjoA=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2642988.jpg
961	224597	Warhammer Underworlds: Shadespire	Warhammer Underworlds is a tactical arena combat game. This is a system designed for balanced, small-scale tactical games that can be played quickly and easily by anyone, but which even experienced players will find challenging to master. The game rules are designed with competitive play in mind; matches can be played in under 45 minutes, on a smaller surface than our larger-scale games, and will be ideal for club or tournament play. And not only that, we&rsquo;ll be fully supporting an organized play system for this game, right from day one.&#10;&#10;The forces you can use in this game will be drawn from races across the Mortal Realms, including some for factions that have not received any new miniatures since we first ventured into the Age of Sigmar. Each of these sets will be composed of a small band of easy-to-assemble, push-fit miniatures in the style of our single-pose heroes to represent a specific band of warriors from that faction. These are provided in coloured plastic, and clip together, so you can quite literally be playing with them within minutes of opening the box with no glue or paint needed! (Though they do look great painted, and your dice will roll better &ndash; probably.)&#10;&#10;The game is played using unique dice and card decks, and these will, to an extent, be unique to each faction. Both decks of cards used in the game are fully customisable &ndash; meaning you can choose to create all manner of combinations of overlapping abilities to use and objectives to achieve. This can be a really rewarding part of the game &ndash; and means that even the same faction can be played in wildly different ways. We&rsquo;re expecting to see all sorts of combinations tried out at game stores, clubs and in tournaments.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;	\N	2	2	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/1Ktu-DEbypjGIe325y3yhg__original/img/u5pGBS1Wc8hGMV98_hR1QIKE8e0=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3750232.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/1Ktu-DEbypjGIe325y3yhg__thumb/img/eL_YmffXd_IsqJgGr1sxR92Iz0I=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3750232.jpg

But resources are limited, and their storage leads to problems that players must deal with, while also not forgetting to upgrade their buildings.

Many magnificent contestants have signed up for the tournament but only a handful will be chosen to join the Tidal Blades, the elite guards of our island realm. To succeed in the Tournament and be chosen as a Tidal Blade, you must compete in Challenges held in the 3 Arenas, rise to the top of the Champion&rsquo;s Board, and protect the realm from the ever increasing threat of the Monsters from the mysterious Fold.&#10;&#10;It has been fifteen years since the Great Battle; 15 years since the Arcanists from the Citadel of Time made their terrible choice and created the Fold; 15 years since the last assemblage of Tidal Blades. The Arcanists folded space and time to stop the onslaught of creatures from the depths, but now new Monsters have appeared, the hard-earned days of peace are coming to a close and the islands need protection. A tournament has been called, the Arenas are ready, the inhabitants of all the islands are gathering, and young heroes from across the realm are showing up to compete to be named a Tidal Blade: Hero of the Reef.&#10;&#10;In Tidal Blades: Heroes of the Reef, each player takes the role of a young hero competing to be named a Tidal Blade. The tournament takes place over 5 Days and Nights. By gathering the needed resources, signing up to compete in Challenges and timing your arrival at different islands you can make the most of your Hero&rsquo;s turns and rise in the ranks of the contestants.&#10;&#10;Each day you will send your hero to take actions on the different Locations and to undertake Challenges. Each action will gain you the resource or effect listed on the action space as well as the Location bonus. At the Arenas you may then attempt a Challenge that matches your Location, and at the Fold you may battle a monster. Completing Challenges and fighting monsters will advance your character in the four traits of Focus, Spirit, Resilience and Synergy.&#10;&#10;Each Tidal Blade will be judged at the end of the 5 rounds based on the Challenges they have completed, the level of each of their Traits, their standing on the Champions Board, and the monsters they have fought.&#10;&#10;	\N	1	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/4PRD3SvbYGPUr-fRjy0O6Q__original/img/epwiTjfYAfJuJHKEbEtu-xDV7bQ=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4309360.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/4PRD3SvbYGPUr-fRjy0O6Q__thumb/img/9cjReRwyhOaCTQ3DoHiLFuStxLU=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4309360.jpg
963	108906	Thunder Alley	Thunder Alley is a stock car racing game for 2&ndash;7 players with the feel and flexibility of a card-driven simulation. Drafting, teamwork, accidents, yellow flags, pit strategy, working to lead laps, and sprints to the finish are all included and bring the feel of racing to the game. Players control not one car, but a team of 3&ndash;6 cars. Thus, each race is not only a run for the checkered flag but an effort to maximize the score for every car on your team. Winning is important, but if only one car crosses the finish line, your team might end up outside the winner's circle looking in.&#10;&#10;The game includes four different types of movement, often with many cars moving with the play of a single card, and each type has its place and time:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Solo movement allows you to break away from the pack.&#10;    Draft and pursuit movement are best used for keeping your team of cars together.&#10;    Lead movement can create a pack of cars that moves toward the front.&#10;&#10;&#10;Turns are fast, each play is important, and the track situation is fluid. The wrong movement in the wrong situation can be disastrous, with you possibly being left out of the draft and all alone. Experienced players will be able to identify the best type of movement for the current situation.&#10;&#10;Cars suffer wear over the course of a race and need to take pit stops. Tire wear, suspension difficulties, fuel issues, and major engine and transmission problems are all modeled in the game. If you feel lucky, you might try to hold it together just a little bit longer in hopes that a yellow flag will come out and cause a mass rush into the pits. Waiting on a yellow that never comes can be maddening as the rest of the pack moves by your worn-out car. What's more, an events deck can make your strategy pay off or punish you for your failure to take precautions. Accidents, yellow flags, worsening track situations, and deteriorating cars are all part of the game. Could all of your perfect strategy be derailed by those incoming rain clouds?&#10;&#10;Included in the game are four different race tracks: a tri-oval super speedway for wide-open free-wheeling racing and a short track for a tight wheel-to-wheel bumper car duel. Each track uses the same deck of racing cards but the cards that work best on one may be useless in the other.  The game also includes a second board with a road course and and 3 turned  (triangle) raceway.&#10;&#10;Most racing games call for a large number of players to play the game at its best. An unusual bonus for Thunder Alley is the very playable and exciting two-player version with six cars on a side.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	7	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/bsJpFlch8oDh0k8e5pc9GA__original/img/3v7tdOnLEyzbD5Nqg4GICov856c=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2062087.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/bsJpFlch8oDh0k8e5pc9GA__thumb/img/WR-dSFptjI6YbamHhQe48Ee5tNw=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2062087.jpg

966	199966	Kingsburg (Second Edition)	The realm of Kingsburg is under attack! Monstrous invaders are gathering at the borders, aiming to invade and plunder the realm! Your king has chosen you to take charge of a province on the border; you will manage your province and help defend the realm. To accomplish this, you must influence the King's advisors and the Royal Family to obtain gold, wood, stones, and soldiers to expand and defend your lands. But you are not the only governor seeking the aid of the advisers! The other players also seek to collect the best resources for their own territories.&#10;&#10;King Tritus is waiting for you. Will you be able to be the most influent and powerful governor of the realm?&#10;&#10;The game of Kingsburg takes place over five years, a total of 20 turns. In every year, there are three production seasons for collecting resources, building structures, and training troops. Every fourth turn is the winter, in which all the players must fight an invading army. Each player must face the invaders, so this is not a cooperative game.&#10;&#10;The resources to build structures and train troops are collected by influencing the advisers in the King's Council.  Players place their influence dice on members of the Council, and each adviser awards different resources or allocate soldiers, victory points, and other advantages to the player who was able to influence that adviser for the current turn. The player with the lowest influence dice sum is the first to choose where to spend their influence; this acts as a way of balancing poor dice rolling. Even with a very unlucky roll, a clever player can still come out from the Council with a good number of resources and/or soldiers.&#10;&#10;At the end of five years, the player who best developed their assigned territory and most pleased the King through the Council wins.&#10;&#10;Kingsburg (Second Edition) includes six expansion modules for use with the base game.&#10;&#10;The new expansion contained in this edition, Kingsburg: Expansion Module #6 &#226;&#128;&#147; Alternate Advisor Rewards, was available by itself for those who have the first edition of Kingsburg.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	5	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/GXdz7ManNSO9nb6z7bsd9w__original/img/Ac9a-JLafZhjZccWwwbXt9kD0cE=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3741713.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/GXdz7ManNSO9nb6z7bsd9w__thumb/img/LRVO4jm8fZMrU5m0fpWOm__8H0Y=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3741713.jpg

Players will command their legions, strategically deploying them to key battlegrounds to try and seize control of the provinces and become ruler of the republic.&#10;&#10;Players draw tokens from a bag to determine their starting forces and to replenish their losses. Players allocate their resources to each province, gaining tactical advantages and vying for control of the republic.&#10;&#10;Three modules to expand the game are included: poison your opponent, deploy powerful Centurions and use underhanded tactics to gain advantages in the Expansions of Rome.&#10;&#10;	\N	1	2	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Mw_WmNeSTRgEgiQG87YPgQ__original/img/fgw5B0oFNDZlNj6Yig97m4625lI=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic6228356.png	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Mw_WmNeSTRgEgiQG87YPgQ__thumb/img/vq3rQ-SOu-77cD61UeJq58dcZZQ=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6228356.png
1011	340466	Unfathomable	The year is 1913. The steamship SS Atlantica is two days out from port on its voyage across the Atlantic Ocean. Its unsuspecting passengers fully anticipated a calm journey to Boston, Massachusetts, with nothing out of the ordinary to look forward to. However, strange nightmares plague the minds of the people aboard the ship every night; rumors circulate of dark shapes following closely behind the ship just beneath the waves; and tensions rise when a body is discovered in the ship's chapel, signs of a strange ritual littered around the corpse.&#10;&#10;Lurking within the depths of the Atlantic Ocean are a swarm of vicious, unspeakable horrors: the Deep Ones, led by Mother Hydra and Father Dagon. For reasons unknown, they have set their sights on the Atlantica, and their minions, taking the form of human-Deep One hybrids, have infiltrated the steamship to help sink it from within. Each game of Unfathomable has one or more players assuming the role of one of these hybrids, and how well they can secretly sabotage the efforts of the other players might mean the difference between a successful voyage and a sunken ship.&#10;&#10;If you're a human, you need to fend off Deep Ones, prevent the Atlantica from taking too much damage, and carefully manage the ship's four crucial resources if you want any hope of making it to Boston, all while trying to figure out which of your fellow players are friends and which are foes. Everyone shares the same resource pool, but humans will try to preserve them while traitors will strive to subtly deplete them. Being able to tell when someone is purposefully draining the group's resources is harder than you think, especially when you take crises into account!&#10;&#10;At the end of each player's turn, that player must draw a mythos card. Each of these cards represents a crisis that the whole group must try to resolve together. Some of these crises, such as &quot;Food Rationing&quot;, call for a choice that could potentially put the ship's passengers or resources at risk, while others, such as &quot;Hull Leak&quot;, call for a skill test in which failure could have disastrous consequences.&#10;&#10;During a skill test, each player contributes skill cards from their hand to a face-down pile shared by the group. Once everyone has contributed (or chosen not to), the cards are shuffled, then revealed. If enough of the correct skills were contributed, then the group passes the test! But if the wrong skills were contributed, they can actually hinder the results, leading to failure. Thus, skill tests are dangerous opportunities for traitors to sabotage the humans' efforts, so you have to stay on your toes at all times.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;	\N	3	6	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/1N4DBN9ggYo7didRPyL2bg__original/img/WLWRzXWDzLRPmHNKzr7bJC1IIrg=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic6230642.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/1N4DBN9ggYo7didRPyL2bg__thumb/img/diJqM9kyGQQPAybVCYd6B5UEv1A=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6230642.jpg
1133	154825	Arkwright	In Arkwright players run up to four factories in England during the late 18th Century. Your goal is to have the most valuable block of own shares. Thus, you must increase your share value and buy shares from the bank.&#10;&#10;To run the factories, you need workers. When hiring Workers, demand is automatically created. But of course you want to replace your expensive workers (wage 2-5) by machines (1). To have more output from your factories you may employ new Workers or improve your factory to the next technical level.&#10;&#10;You fix the price for your goods during an action round. To enhance your chances of selling goods, you improve your factories to higher levels, increase the quality and make some sales promotion. The higher these factors, the better are your chances of success - the higher the price, the lower.&#10;&#10;Each player has an own set of &quot;action tokens&quot; like &quot;build and modernize factories&quot;, &quot;employ new workers&quot;, &quot;improve quality&quot; etc. On your turn you place one of those tokens on one of the free spaces in your line of the &quot;Administration board&quot; and pay the according administration costs, ranging from 2 to 10 (even numbers). Some actions depend on how much you paid, i.e. you may buy more machines with one single action, when you pay more (= use a higher space, which is then blocked for the rest of the round). During the game your actions become more and more effective by new tokens, i.e. allow you to buy 3 machines in a single turn instead of 2, increase quality 2 levels instead of only 1...).&#10;&#10;After each round of actions one kind of factories is active and you have to pay for all your workers and machines there, then sell the manufactured products. The value of your shares increases for sold products and best quality.&#10;&#10;Goods may also be traded to the colonies by ship - provided you have a contract with the monopoly of the East Indian Company.&#10;&#10;After four turns each of the factories has produced and the round ends. Players remove the action tokens from the administration board and reveal an event token. After 5 rounds the player with the most valuable block of shares wins. Neither being to be the one with the most shares nor being the one with the highest share value guarantees victory.&#10;&#10;Arkwright allows you to act in different ways. Run all four factories with most possible output, set the focus on only two factories and improve them more than the others can; use shipping to colony or focus on the home market. In any way you have to react to the opponents and their strategy. Enter markets with deficit in supply or give up business where the other players start to push you out. Buy shares when they are cheap and increase the value, or first make money and buy shares later.&#10;&#10;To get familiar with the market mechanics you may start with a 120 minutes version &quot;Spinning Jenny&quot;, but for those who like full strategy in economic themed games, the 240 minute &quot;Waterframe&quot;-Rules come with more options to improve your factory and use ships.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/42Arfn__U6EZcAj6biuh4w__original/img/mT2Oug5XPaSWIW0M-nNoZW4qmSY=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic2776693.png	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/42Arfn__U6EZcAj6biuh4w__thumb/img/zM8pwB0LilhgIQd67L7mOgeZ25o=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2776693.png
968	270239	Moonrakers	Moonrakers is a game of shipbuilding, temporary alliances, and shrewd negotiation set in a space-faring future. The players form a loose band of mercenaries, but while they are united in name, actual alliances are shaky as players are pitted against each other in the quest to become the new leader of the Moonrakers.&#10;&#10;Moonrakers is a deck-building game in which players choose Contracts to attempt alone or with Allies in order to gain Prestige and Credits. After negotiating terms with Allies, players use their decks of Action cards to play Thrusters, Shields, Weapons, Reactors, and Crew to fulfill the requirements on each Contract. Each type of Action card has additional effects such as extra Actions, drawing additional cards, and protecting players from Hazards encountered while attempting Contracts.&#10;&#10;Players create powerful decks and gain special abilities by upgrading their ships and hiring Crew Members. This helps them accomplish more difficult and rewarding contracts alone, letting them keep more Prestige and Credits for themselves.&#10;&#10;Allies negotiate who will receive the Prestige, Credits, and risk of Hazard from Contracts, but if you don't make your offers enticing enough players may be tempted to betray you! The first player to 10 Prestige wins, but be careful as hazards encountered on Contracts reduce your Prestige!&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;	\N	1	5	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/atjJKVYnNTTn1gZ2lbw8bA__original/img/-KJg0tyMdrRyR4OHx6UeDF8pKtU=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic5631285.png	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/atjJKVYnNTTn1gZ2lbw8bA__thumb/img/LWKATlCPQOqfF3cJMhrnQxWRuyE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5631285.png
969	369880	Beer & Bread	Beer &amp; Bread is a multi-use card game for two players. Its clever structure of alternating rounds puts a fascinating twist on player interaction, card drafting, and resource management.&#10;&#10;Founded on the fruitful lands of an erstwhile monastery, two villages have held up the dual tradition of brewing beer and baking bread. While sharing fields and resources, they still find pride in their friendly rivalry of besting each other&rsquo;s produce.&#10;&#10;Each of you represents one of these villages. Over the course of six years - which alternate between fruitful and dry - you must harmonize your duties of harvesting and storing resources, producing beer and bread, selling them for coins and upgrading your facilities.&#10;&#10;However, in order to win, you must maintain the balance between your baked and liquid goods. Because, after the sixth year, you only score the coins collected from the type of good - beer or bread - for which you earned less. The village with the higher score wins.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from publisher&#10;&#10;	\N	2	2	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/vPRTRJce1GOsUf6M_dWd-g__original/img/IiugqYTDlz1Rk1EAaEwDxr65YgI=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic7064178.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/vPRTRJce1GOsUf6M_dWd-g__thumb/img/x0Q2R8xgABJACUHYSCA00a7j3Cg=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7064178.jpg

Designed for 1-5 players, this boardgame features multiple scenarios, challenging quests, and cooperative gameplay.&#10;&#10;Each player selects a hero; a ranger, rogue, warrior, cleric, or wizard. On their turn, each player can explore further into the dungeon (turn over new tiles), move through the already explored parts of the dungeon, and fight monsters. When a new dungeon tile is revealed, there is typically an encounter of some sort, and new monsters to fight are added. Slain monsters reward the players with treasure, and experience points, allowing them to level up and increase their skills during play. Players must cooperate to stay alive, slay the monsters, and achieve the goal of their quest. Each scenario has a different goal - from retrieving a relic, to slaying a vampire lord.&#10;&#10;	\N	1	5	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/4opHd-PZm42sUE0DD7m8_w__original/img/tatfzsU05LERJtPwCIXjLjadbnQ=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic660244.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/4opHd-PZm42sUE0DD7m8_w__thumb/img/FRE_ow1_sOI4yMvXEKhUc58nXTs=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic660244.jpg

974	112	Condottiere	It is 13th century Italy. Trade is flourishing between the city-states and the Levant. Venice, Florence, and Genoa are all bursting with wealth. However, each city-state is also plagued with a weak national army, leaving them defenseless against invasion from their envious neighbors. Enter the Condottiere. &#10; As veteran English soldiers returned from the Crusades, Italy found itself with an influx of desperate and capable men. These hired swords were contracted to fight for individual city-states by an agreement known as a condotta. The most elite of these men were the mercenary leaders known as the Condottiere.&#10;&#10;The object of Condottiere is to acquire four connected provinces in renaissance Italy. To do this players auction off different provinces on the board and bid on these provinces with a hand of cards representing mercenaries, seasons, scarecrows, and political figures. However, unlike standard auctions in which only the highest bidder loses their bid, in Condottiere every player loses their bid.  Players are, in effect, bidding the number of troops they are willing to lose in order to win a province. However, several special effect cards shake the contests up and keep the players guessing.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	6	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/PZ3Y8nJBWeQzLrCbjFcNFA__original/img/8Bpu1jLH8p2HG7Wr3qvtd_v4LP8=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic6974400.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/PZ3Y8nJBWeQzLrCbjFcNFA__thumb/img/JlexS7tQcxoP8MUfTCd0ct39a2A=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6974400.jpg

977	290484	Unsettled	Lost amidst the surreal and bizarre unknowns of the far reaches of the cosmos, your crew of explorers must pull together to discover the resources necessary to survive the long journey home.&#10;&#10;Unsettled is a 2-4 player cooperative survival adventure set in the wondrous and unnerving fringes of uncharted space. There are no enemies and no combat, only an environment where every step, every breath, every particle around you could mean immediate, terrifying, death. Enemies are the least of your concerns.&#10;&#10;In these incredible conditions you must complete a series of tasks necessary to your continued survival. Perhaps the water reclamation system on the ship needs repair, or (as usual) food supplies are running low. Before you lies a strange alien landscape - it&rsquo;s up to you to complete these tasks using&hellip;whatever you find out there.&#10;&#10;Each time you play you will have a different combination of survival tasks to complete and the things you discover (and their weird properties) will be different as well. So while you always start out knowing what problems you need to solve you have no idea how you&rsquo;re going to use the world before you to do so (or what the world is going to do to you while you try).&#10;&#10;As you explore the environment, encountering wild &amp; unique opportunities along the way, you will work closely with the rest of your crew to achieve your goal of continued existence. The only thing you can be sure of is each other; lose that trust and you&rsquo;ll lose all hope of survival.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;This core set comes with 2 planets, Planet 001-Wenora and Planet 002-Grakkis, which are not available individually.&#10;&#10;Embrace your fungal hosts and discover mind-bending abilities beyond your imagination or be absorbed forever.

Unsettled: Grakkis is the 2nd planet box for &quot;Unsettled&quot;.&#10;&#10;Grakkis is a sand-swept desert ruins. What was once a massive planet-wide forest of unfathomably large trees is now that forest's graveyard - all the trees having long since petrified to a stone-like state. Some have crumbled into interesting formations. Some had rotted before petrifying, creating strange caves and crevices, many of them thousands of feet above ground.

The blocks must all be played in a line and match, without duplicates, either the color or shape of the previous block.&#10;&#10;Players score one point for each block played plus all blocks adjacent. It is possible for a block to score in more than one direction. If a player completes a line containing all six shapes or colors, an additional six points are scored. The player then refills his hand to six blocks.&#10;&#10;The game ends when the draw bag is depleted and one player plays all of his remaining blocks, earning a six point bonus. The player with the high score wins.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/k7zHj8j_a6uUAtXUt5Fvuw__original/img/FNi6yap-UmVKX8X6rj0A_YW2q8Y=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic309353.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/k7zHj8j_a6uUAtXUt5Fvuw__thumb/img/APPui4zwBuwAIHXSTW6UxYcY6Ow=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic309353.jpg
979	13642	Louis XIV	Louis XIV, by R&uuml;diger Dorn, is about power and influence in the French court at the end of the 17th Century.&#10;&#10;The players take on the roles of members of the Court, where they carry out their missions and goals at Versailles. By using cards and influence markers, they influence high-ranking Court attendants, such as the King's Mother or one of the countless Royal mistresses. Naturally, the Sun King himself has a special role here too.&#10;&#10;An excellent time and a high level of tension are guaranteed. The final outcome is in doubt right up to the end. Each game is different. A change of pace but still a highly promising strategy game in the finest Alea tradition, one that sits at level 5 on the Alea complexity scale.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/TsxO4Iggn_kKRMBlR14gJg__original/img/y74HCBcfAABuZUy6kFc9PbFq1HM=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic63296.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/TsxO4Iggn_kKRMBlR14gJg__thumb/img/fqur7wJo01qzNKMPAbd2yYHO0pY=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic63296.jpg
1037	307002	Regicide	Regicide is a cooperative, fantasy card game for 1 to 4 players, played using a standard deck of cards.&#10;&#10;Players work together to defeat 12 powerful enemies. On their turn a player plays a card to the table to attack the enemy and once enough damage is dealt, the enemy is defeated. The players win when the last King is defeated. But beware! Each turn the enemy strikes back. Players will discard cards to satisfy the damage and if they can't discard enough, everyone loses.&#10;&#10;Rich with tactical decisions and a deep heuristic tree, Regicide is a huge challenge for anyone who is brave enough to take it on.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;For a dice-based, typo-inspired, April 1st-announced game from the same designers, try Regidice!&#10;&#10;	\N	1	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/C9U2E51tkzLljewFEGQ74g__original/img/Q-a5lAydzhwNLLhy8n326tlxuYE=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5837347.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/C9U2E51tkzLljewFEGQ74g__thumb/img/4KV3wj3NiJDgGTh3zmW0_8Ph3Zc=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5837347.jpg
980	201921	Tiny Epic Quest	A world of peace has been torn asunder by the opening of a vile portal from the goblin kingdom. Nasty goblins pour into the peaceful groves and villages of the elf world, setting the realm ablaze. Now you, the heroes, must quest in order to right this wrong. There are two paths to victory: closing the portal or slaying all the goblins. Which one will you choose? Either way, your quests will be aided by the help of the surviving mushroom folk &mdash; and by the epic items that have been lost in the realm's deep dungeons. The world is ending quickly, so you must act fast to save it, but you also need to know when your luck will run out...&#10;&#10;In Tiny Epic Quest, players embark on a sandbox adventure. Each player controls a band of three elf heroes questing to save the world and the sacred mushroom folk from the intruding goblins.&#10;&#10;Each round is broken into two phases: day and night. During the day, players travel far and wide, visiting villages to acquire quests, monuments to learn powerful spells, mushroom groves to seek guidance, and treacherous locations in search of artifacts! Acquiring artifacts empower the heroes with unique abilities; this may improve a heroes' movement or combat, or their ability to learn spells or mitigate harmful dice rolls.&#10;&#10;Heroes must travel by foot, by horse, by raft, by boat and by gryphon to get to everywhere they need to go to satisfy their quests &mdash; or to position themselves for what night brings. As each type of movement is different, and limited, players need to take careful consideration when traveling, and how they travel, if they wish to accomplish all of their goals.&#10;&#10;During the night, players must face the challenge of their quests, and decisions, by rolling dice, hoping for fortune, and knowing when to quit. Will you press on? Or is it time to save your progress and rest? Tomorrow is another day.&#10;&#10;The game ends once the portal is closed or all the goblins have been eradicated. The player who has acquired the most victory points by slaying goblins, learning spells, and completing quests is crowned the winner!&#10;&#10;&#10;For a deluxe edition of this game, see Tiny Epic Quest: Deluxe Edition&#10;&#10;	\N	1	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Cd65qIFLnJlkWTfbKDk_FA__original/img/k-346D8FwQe_GUwi40trFGjD7JM=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3120755.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Cd65qIFLnJlkWTfbKDk_FA__thumb/img/RaWuVFlY9wTY4g0d46WMWkZ-E3k=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3120755.jpg
981	38054	Snow Tails	Snow Tails is set in the snowy world of the Arctic Circle, where brave sledders compete in a test of skill and endurance. Action is fast and furious and not all sleds may make it to the finish. Huskies only have one setting and that is full speed! Hang on to your furs, the reins, your sled and anything else you can get hold of.&#10;&#10;The game contains modular track pieces which can be fitted together to form different courses. Players have their own Dog Decks which they draw from and play onto their sled mat. Movement is rarely in a straight line as the sled may drift left or right. Losing control or speeding into a corner results in Dent cards being acquired which will limit a player's hand size.&#10;&#10;The game features a fun and original movement mechanism.&#10;&#10;&#10;Game Summary &#10;Race courses are built randomly. Players each have a dog sled with 2 dogs (initially valued 3 each) and a brake (also 3). Each player has the same deck of cards (5 sets of cards 1-5, shuffled) from which they draw a hand of 5 cards.&#10;&#10;On your turn, may play 1-3 cards of the same value to these 3 locations (dog1, dog2, brakes). Forward speed (and distance moved) = dog1 + dog2 - brake + bonus (=position in race) if (dog1 = dog2). Lateral movement distance = dog1 - dog2 (move to the side with the stronger dog). Certain parts of the track have speed limits; you take damage if you exceed them, or if you run into obstacles (ice patches, side of track, etc.). Damage = cards that take up space in your hand (so 5th damage --&gt; out of the race!).&#10;&#10;The first player to cross the finish line wins!&#10;&#10;	\N	2	5	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/-narZPLY3ffctYJlxZOTuQ__original/img/A1GaBL7x2tQ1REaFeHzND5hluUI=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic2574022.png	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/-narZPLY3ffctYJlxZOTuQ__thumb/img/sy6nL2Tvw68OEprLJZQyP1ATUdU=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2574022.png
982	242804	Lowlands	The low land is a rough area where hard-working folk make a living by the sweat of their brow. Under constant threat of storm and flood, communities here rally together to build dikes that keep the rising water at bay. But every citizen constructing a dike is one fewer citizen tending flocks and maintaining the family farm. The residents here are constantly torn between selflessness and self-interest, and only those who can strike this delicate balance can thrive in this harsh landscape.&#10;&#10;In Lowlands, you carve your farm out of this unforgiving land, gathering and spending resource cards to transform your farmyard into pastures that allow you to profit from breeding sheep. Adding expansions to your farm will unlock new options and score you victory points, but helping to build the dike that collectively protects all players is also rewarded. No matter what, the tide will rise and, if the dike isn't high enough, it could rush in and sweep away your hard-earned profits. Will you sacrifice your own farm for the good of the community, or will you pursue your own agenda? The choice is yours.&#10;&#10;Even without the poor weather, life on a farm is one of constant work where you find yourself tending flocks of sheep, extending their pastures, and looking for the right moment to sell them for a profit. To complete all these tasks, Lowlands gives you a group of farmers that you can assign to various tasks around your farm. To get the most out of them, you must think strategically, deciding which actions you want to take and the best time to take them. Once they've been assigned, your farmers help you build a bustling farm where there was once scrubby bushes, trees, and lakes. You begin the game with only two sheep and a small pasture, but your farmyard is rife with possibilities, its many empty spaces inviting you to customize your farm as you see fit.&#10;&#10;While you could simply focus on creating more area for your sheep to roam, the game also provides plenty of options for customizing your farm with various buildings and features. Not only are these tiles worth victory points at the end of the game, they also make your farm more efficient and more profitable. You might add a feeding trough to your farm, for example, to immediately earn another sheep and the ability to house two sheep per pasture space instead of just one. Or you could construct a lake cabin on your property to get away from it all for a bit. While this tile doesn't give you any special abilities, it increases the value in victory points of the farmyard spaces immediately adjacent to it. Ultimately, you are free to pursue whatever strategy you see fit, building a farm wholly your own.&#10;&#10;On top of the challenges of building a successful farm, of course, you also have to deal with the tempestuous weather that comes with living on the wave-battered coast of the North Sea. Here, the tides always seem to rise a little higher, threatening to take a dent out of your profits by sweeping away some of your flock. To ensure that this doesn't happen, you always have the opportunity to send your farmers to contribute to the dike instead of working on your farm. When you do, you also commit resources to creating dike elements that are added to the board as a buffer against the rising waters. Add enough of these pieces and you might prevent disaster for everyone. The tide turns repeatedly, bringing with it new flood pieces. If there are enough dike elements in place to hold back the rising waters, players' farms are spared. If the dike breaks, however, you could be forced to take dike breach tokens that have adverse effects at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;While lending a hand with the dike at the expense of your own farm is certainly a nice gesture that keeps everyone safe from the floodwaters, it has rewards of its own. For each resource you contribute to the dike, you advance one step up the dike track. Not only does advancing far enough on this track grant victory points, it also amplifies your reward if the dike holds and lessens the blow when it breaks. It is in your best interest, then, to keep pace with other players on the dike in order to protect your investments back home one the farm.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/2uRvcCayqNG38NJQBcESAA__original/img/oqKvrfwO_KxjHMaz9kNlJf_4MlM=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4007841.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/2uRvcCayqNG38NJQBcESAA__thumb/img/fMI59KCpNrF_uemwoD5-CBY96hc=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4007841.jpg

1038	42776	Gears of War: The Board Game	Game description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;For a time, the humans of Sera knew peace...then Emergence Day came. The Locust horde arrived without warning, and countless horrors spilled forth from their underground burrows. The Coalition of Organized Governments (COG) struggled to fend off the subterranean threat, but their defenses were quickly crushed. With billions dead, humans turned their weapons of mass destruction on their own cities to deny the enemy control. Now the long struggle against overwhelming odds approaches one final, desperate stand.&#10;&#10;Gears of War: The Board Game, designed by Corey Konieczka, is based on the wildly popular third-person shooter by Epic Games. One to four players take on the roles of COG soldiers cooperating to destroy the Locust horde, and must work together to complete missions against an ingeniously challenging and varied game system. In Gears of War: The Board Game, you&rsquo;ll relive classic moments from Gears of War and Gears of War 2 &ndash; Roadie Run into cover, spray your enemy with blind fire, or rip him in half with your Lancer's chainsaw!&#10;&#10;In Gears of War: The Board Game you must fulfill one of seven randomly constructed missions and support your fellow COGs as your team engages an unflinching enemy in furious, white-knuckle firefights!

985	23540	Shikoku 1889	1889, an 18xx game in the series originated by Francis Tresham's 1829, is set in Shikoku Japan.  The rules are similar to 1830: Railways & Robber Barons on a smaller and terrain-heavy map.&#10;&#10;In 1889, 2-6 players will use money to purchase shares in railroad companies during Share Dealing Rounds. Between subsequent Share Dealing Rounds, railroad corporations then conduct operations on the game board, with the decisions being made by the player who is the major share holder. The game simulates the progression of railroad development during an historic period on Shikoku. Old trains become obsolete while the revenue earnings from cities grows over time. Players will try to purchase the most profitable shares at the right times of the game to maximize earnings in dividends and stock value gains. In the end, the player with the highest value of personal cash and held stocks is the winner.&#10;&#10;The game was originally available in kit form from Wild Heaven, and is now also being published by Grand Trunk Games.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	6	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/KWzepkM_pNKLOCdDDJLg0g__original/img/gTkkZV8qMZ2p4IxzFBVqnOeCb0w=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic6535570.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/KWzepkM_pNKLOCdDDJLg0g__thumb/img/vU5AOCjGnQ1VvuM8p2hHqrUFfwU=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6535570.jpg
986	98351	Core Worlds	Introduction&#10;&#10;The ancient Galactic Realm, ruled from the Core Worlds of the galaxy, is waning. Now, the barbaric kingdoms that lie beyond the galactic frontier are amassing their strength, choosing this pivotal moment to strike at the heart of the fading republic, establishing new empires built upon the ashes of decaying civilizations. But these outer systems are not yet strong enough to engage the forces of the Core Worlds directly. The young kingdoms must first gnaw at the edges of the crumbling frontier, developing new types of units and shrewder tactics. They must build up their energy resources to launch magnificent fleets and overwhelming ground forces. Then, when the time is right, they must strike at the galactic core itself, claiming the most exalted planets for themselves. The barbarian kingdom that achieves these goals will carve out the greatest empire in the galaxy.&#10;&#10;Object of the Game&#10;&#10;Each player controls a barbarian Star Empire represented by many cards. Throughout the game, players will invade Worlds and draft new Units and Tactics into their Empires. Each card lists its Empire Points in the upper right corner. The player whose Empire contains the most Empire Points at the end of the game is the winner!&#10;&#10;Game Terms and Game Play Mechanisms&#10;&#10;Core Worlds is a deck-building card game for 2-5 players. The following are the central concepts of Core Worlds:&#10;&#10;&bull; Central Zone: Throughout the game, new cards are drawn from the five Galactic Decks and placed face up in the Central Zone, the game's common play area. These cards include new Units and Tactics that the players can draft into their Empires, as well as Worlds that they can invade.&#10;&#10;&bull; Empire: Each player represents an Empire that begins with a Home World and a Starting Deck. A player's Empire consists of all of the cards in his hand, draw deck, discard pile, and Warzone (tableau).&#10;&#10;&bull; Fleet Strength: Each World possesses a Fleet Strength that represents the starships that defend it from attack. A World's Fleet Strength must be matched in order for that World to be successfully invaded. Many Units possess a Fleet Strength that a player can use to invade a World.&#10;&#10;&bull; Ground Strength: Each World possesses a Ground Strength that represents the infantry and other ground forces that defend it from surface assault. A World's Ground Strength must be matched in order for it to be successfully invaded. Many Units possess a Ground Strength that a player can use to invade a World.&#10;&#10;&bull; Invasion: In order to add new Worlds to his Empire, a player must launch Invasions. A player performs an Invasion by discarding enough cards from his Warzone to match the Fleet Strength and Ground Strength of the World he is invading.&#10;&#10;&bull; Warzone: Each player's Empire includes a Warzone, an area in front of the player where her conquered Worlds are displayed. Players also deploy Units from their hands face up into their Warzones, and later use these Units to invade new Worlds.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	5	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Yim5NN5RexitX1ZaAsrKSg__original/img/vTRod_K2284wZIUN4Xcc9P7g1R0=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1063921.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Yim5NN5RexitX1ZaAsrKSg__thumb/img/sianmpiJv5zgUJcB5K4fJj0MXyE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1063921.jpg

A cave mouth leads to a maze of tunnels and chambers, and deep within this monster-infested labyrinth lurks the most terrifying creature of all: a red dragon!&#10;&#10;Designed for 1-5 players, this boardgame features multiple scenarios, challenging quests, and cooperative game play.&#10;&#10;Each player selects a hero; a rogue, thief, warrior, cleric, or wizard. On their turn, each player can explore further into the dungeon (turn over new tiles), move through the already explored parts of the dungeon, and fight monsters. When a new dungeon tile is revealed, there is typically an encounter of some sort, and new monsters to fight are added. Slain monsters reward the players with treasure, and experience points, allowing them to level up and increase their skills during play. Players must cooperate to stay alive, slay the monsters, and achieve the goal of their quest.

A team of two players &ndash; neighbors at the table &ndash; choose a word or phrase that the other players need to guess. Acting together, this team places pieces judiciously on the available icons on the game board.&#10;&#10;To get others to guess &quot;milk&quot;, for example, the team might place the question mark icon (which signifies the main concept) on the liquid icon, then cubes of this color on the icons for &quot;food/drink&quot; and &quot;white&quot;. For a more complicated concept, such as &quot;Leonardo DiCaprio&quot;, the team can use the main concept and its matching cubes to clue players into the hidden phrase being an actor or director, while then using sub-concept icons and their matching cubes to gives clues to particular movies in which DiCaprio starred, such as Titanic or Inception.&#10;&#10;The first player to discover the word or phrase receives 2 victory points, the team receives points as well, and the player who ends up with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;	\N	4	12	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/hHFs0_KRoW_FJ0cMIVgZcw__original/img/vbR7Wrdlq4fPcwUE1Ck9CowlJHY=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4991925.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/hHFs0_KRoW_FJ0cMIVgZcw__thumb/img/1MmGQvJVNw8TA7eWAJ8oIK-ZENc=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4991925.jpg

Each round, players simultaneously select 4 of their 10 role cards, and then they take turns playing one role at a time. Each role has a brave action and a cowardly action; the brave action is stronger, but riskier, as another player could steal the action from you later; the cowardly action is safer, but not as robust. How well can you bluff your opponents?&#10;&#10;Use the gatherer roles to collect ingredients to make potions, the witch roles to zoom around on your broom to different areas, and the witch or druid roles to deliver the potions, collecting victory points as you go. Chase away lightning clouds with the help of the weather fairy, and keep an eye on the event cards that change game play, one event per round.&#10;&#10;The winner is the player with the most victory points after all 7 rounds are complete and end-of-game bonus points have been awarded.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	5	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/PcxTKtTwov2vxkZZbRVDAw__original/img/kjg4hSkTE2a8MKlkZNgTGqfKqgc=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2546156.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/PcxTKtTwov2vxkZZbRVDAw__thumb/img/exJUDw66ox4k5H5dSX_oAOuRNXk=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2546156.jpg

During each of the four game rounds, you take several turns, and on each turn you either:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Use your engineer in the headquarters to program a bot; each round you can choose from three of the seven actions.&#10;    Have your scientist bring a bot to a sector to perform an action.&#10;&#10;&#10;Through actions such as improving your lab, sending out submarines, collecting crystals, and examining octopuses, you expand the abilities of your team or gather knowledge points, which are necessary to win. Additional challenges result from the limited size of your lab, which is your personal stock; you can increase the size of your lab, which makes life easier, but this costs valuable time.&#10;&#10;AquaSphere is a challenging game of strategy and tactics with different paths to victory that requires planning in advance as well as skillful use of short-term opportunities.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/K7Hq_KDgr8jJHMtW21XcfQ__original/img/PckhyT2sfyT93TPkIRyKrvPpPMs=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2197124.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/K7Hq_KDgr8jJHMtW21XcfQ__thumb/img/ZddcJnCbwkBUoilb5x-Bj-k7tio=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2197124.jpg

1009	264055	Draftosaurus	Your goal in Draftosaurus is to have the dino park most likely to attract visitors. To do so, you have to draft dino meeples and place them in pens that have some placement restrictions. Each turn, one of the players roll a die and this adds a constraint to which pens any other player can add their dinosaur.&#10;&#10;Draftosaurus is a quick and light drafting game in which you don't have a hand of cards that you pass around (after selecting one), but a bunch of dino meeples in the palm of your hand.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	5	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/JahbLRZ_jEe8P8gisXUtJw__original/img/Ug7yXzMmgpaqcv7B_lNTXsAk7_g=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4447676.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/JahbLRZ_jEe8P8gisXUtJw__thumb/img/XGKi6qBOizS_IdLqOHny-rf0JZw=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4447676.jpg
1012	216734	Dice Throne: Season One	Dice Throne is a game of intriguing dice, tactical card play, powerful heroes, and unique abilities.&#10;&#10;It's a fast-paced 2-6 player combat game (1v1, 2v2, 3v3, 2v2v2, or free-for-all). Select from a variety of heroes that play and feel completely distinct from one another. Attack opponents and activate abilities by rolling your hero's unique set of five dice. Accumulate combat points and spend them on cards that have a large range of effects, such as granting permanent hero upgrades, applying status effects, and manipulating dice directly (yours, your teammate's, or even your opponent's).&#10;&#10;&#10;Let's take a look at a turn of a 1v1 game.&#10;&#10;The game begins with 2 players selecting their heroes. Player One chooses Moon Elf and player two picks Barbarian. Each player begins the game with 50 HP (Health Points).&#10;&#10;Player One (the Moon Elf) won the roll to go first. The Moon Elf draws their 4 starting game cards and begins the game with 1 CP (Combat Point). &#10;&#10;    Note- The player that wins the starting roll does not draw a card (above their starting hand of 4) or gain CP above their 1 starting CP. &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;The Moon Elf then checks for status effects (like poison, or Burn) to resolve.&#10;&#10;The next phase is called Main Phase (1). This is where the Moon Elf player can upgrade their hero board with cards from their hands if they have enough CP to pay for the upgrades. They can also play any Main Phase Action cards (blue cards).&#10;&#10;Then they enter the Offensive Roll Phase. The Moon Elf can take up to 3 roll attempts (with their 5 dice) to accomplish an action or attack from their hero board. After deciding on an action within the 3 roll attempts an action is declared.&#10;&#10;Then the Defensive Roll Phase begins where the opponent (Barbarian) can use their defensive roll (as it appears on their hero board). The amount of damage or incoming status affects are resolved and that concludes the Defensive Roll Phase.&#10;&#10;&#10;     During Offensive and Defensive Roll Phase any player can play Roll Phase Action cards from their hand as long as they have the CP to pay for it.&#10;&#10;&#10;The Moon Elf player enters their second Main Phase where they can do any final hero board upgrades or play blue Main Phase Action cards.&#10;&#10;The Moon Elf then must discard any extra cards over 6 from their hand.&#10;&#10;The Barbarian player begins his turn by drawing one additional card (over his starting hand of 4) and gaining one CP (Combat Point) for a total of 2.&#10;&#10;The Barbarian then follows the same phases the Moon Elf.&#10;&#10;The game alternates hero turns until one player is at 0 Health.&#10;&#10;DiceThrone is for 2-6 players, ages 8+, and runs 20-30 minutes for a battle. With the ever expanding gallery of heroes the game feels fresh each time you jump in!&#10;&#10;	\N	2	6	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/crZpafHHxItU5EWPCgNbPA__original/img/SW7p_jpQKI-EGcMGjenPjHvGTL0=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3962955.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/crZpafHHxItU5EWPCgNbPA__thumb/img/6-MfhRxfMD7KwZq9jQT1tZFHTIY=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3962955.jpg
1013	42215	Tobago	Tobago is an adventure game in which the players use representations of treasure maps to locate unknown treasures. During the game, more and more information about the location of a treasure is revealed and its possible locations are gradually narrowed down. When the location of one of the treasures is finally revealed players try to reach it as quickly as possible to secure the findings. The more clues you have provided, the more of a stake you will have in the loot.&#10;Players can carefully play their clues and use bonus-action gems to influence where and when the treasure is found in order to ensure a more favourable outcome when the loot is finally 'dug up' and shared.&#10;&#10;The game features a 3 piece, double-sided, modular game board which can be rearranged to create 32 possible island arrangements.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/fuC2C10_6QK84R45Mseojw__original/img/H3S1YSPe4O54yLV3W4G_zSTIiwU=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic596625.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/fuC2C10_6QK84R45Mseojw__thumb/img/bfp4x8H9nzQJQyNf2amKyx1BqUs=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic596625.jpg

1015	359609	Arkham Horror: The Card Game (Revised Edition)	The boundaries between worlds have drawn perilously thin. Dark forces work in the shadows and call upon unspeakable horrors, strange happenings are discovered all throughout the city of Arkham, Massachusetts, and behind it all an Ancient One manipulates everything from beyond the veil. It is time to revisit that which started it all&hellip;&#10;&#10;With a revamped system of organization and a number of quality-of-life improvements, the box comes with everything you need to get your Arkham campaigns started, including enough cards and components for up to three other players to join you in your quest against the Mythos.&#10;&#10;What Has Changed?&#10;- More players (up to 4) than the core set.&#10;- second copies of all the 96 player cards for deck building purposes and 13 additional player cards for deckbuilding, previously released in expansions, in 2 copies each (scenario cards stay the same)&#10;- a drawing bag (&quot;Chaos Bag&quot;) for the Chaos Tokens&#10;- New organization (meaning that it&rsquo;s much easier to find specific cards than it was before)&#10;- additional quality-of-life improvements have been made, such as new numbered resource and clue/threat tokens and even a lead investigator token&#10;- Revised &quot;Learn to Play&quot; rule book for easier starting&#10;- Some cards with new art&#10;&#10;In the game, you and your friend (or up to three in this revised version) become characters within the quiet New England town of Arkham. You have your talents, sure, but you also have your flaws. Perhaps you've dabbled a little too much in the writings of the Necronomicon, and its words continue to haunt you. Perhaps you feel compelled to cover up any signs of otherworldly evils, hampering your own investigations in order to protect the quiet confidence of the greater population. Perhaps you'll be scarred by your encounters with a ghoulish cult.&#10;&#10;&#10;One key fact to keep in mind: the revised edition is 100% compatible with all material previously published. The new starter box contains the same cards (excepting some renewed art), just more of them. &quot;Old-timers&quot; can continue where they left off under the new two-boxes campaign format (replacing the old 1+6+1 format) starting with Edge of the Earth.&#10;&#10;	\N	1	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/RdCWCXPnBGSxoOhk5Hkq_g__original/img/ekoKDLjgeUoPw3mpPUPfy-Xnjeo=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic6530423.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/RdCWCXPnBGSxoOhk5Hkq_g__thumb/img/QyBd2yZWmWOdudkHw0YF1__74ak=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6530423.jpg
1016	130960	Triumph & Tragedy: European Balance of Power 1936-1945	Triumph &amp; Tragedy is a geopolitical strategy game for 3  players (also playable by 2) covering the competition for European supremacy during the period 1936-45 between Capitalism (the West), Communism (the Soviet  Union) and Fascism (the Axis). It has diplomatic, economic, technological and military components, and can be won by gaining economic hegemony or  technological supremacy (A-bomb), or by vanquishing a rival militarily.&#10;&#10;The 22 x 34 area map covers Eurasia to India and the Urals, plus the Americas. Military units are 5/8&quot; blocks, of 7 types   (Infantry/Tank/Fortress/AirForce/Carrier/Fleet/Submarine), in 7 different colors (Germany/Italy/Russia/Britain/France/USA/Neutral). The mix of over 200 blocks allows great flexibility of force composition. There is a 55-card Action deck and a 55-card Investment deck, plus 30 Peace Dividend chits and 110 markers of various types.&#10;&#10;The  game starts in 1936, with all 3 Great Powers virtually disarmed: Germany has repudiated the Versailles Peace Treaty, initiating an arms race in Europe. With blocks, the nature of military buildups remain unknown to rivals unless/until military conflict breaks out. The  game may end peacefully or there may be war. There are game sanctions for attacking neutral minors or declaring war on an opponent, and rewards for remaining peaceful (you get a Peace Dividend chit of value 0-2 for every year you remain at Peace).&#10;&#10;You can win peacefully by:  &#10;&bull; Economic Hegemony (total of Production + secret Peace Dividend values + Atomic Research is the greatest in 1945, or reaches 25 at any time) OR &#10;&bull; Technological Supremacy (build the A-bomb which takes 4 stages and be able to deliver it to a Main Capital).&#10;&#10;If there is war, you can still win by either of the above methods (with extra Economic Hegemony victory points available), or by:&#10;&bull; Military Victory (capture TWO enemy capitals out of nine: each player controls three).&#10;&#10;Economic production underlies all forms of power in the game. Production is the LEAST of controlled Population (cities), controlled Resources, and Industry (which starts low and can be built up with Investment cards), except that Resources can be ignored if at Peace.&#10;&#10;Powers can spend their current economic Production on either: &#10;&bull; Military units (new 1-step units or additional steps on existing units), OR &#10;&bull; Action cards, which have Diplomatic values (to gain Population and Resources without conflict) and a Command value (to move military units), OR &#10;&bull; Investment cards, which have Technological values (to enhance unit abilities) and a Factory value (the only way to increase Industry levels).&#10;&#10;Building a unit step or buying a card costs 1 Production. Simple. You can&rsquo;t inspect cards bought until after you have spent all Production.&#10;&#10;Initially, the Axis economy is Population/Resource limited, but ahead in [war] Industry, while the West and Russia are Industry-limited, with adequate empires of Population and Resources. Throttling/limiting rival economies by denial of Population/Resources is a key form of competition. In peacetime, this is primarily done via Diplomacy, committing Action cards to gain control of minor nations and their Population/Resources, or to deny or reduce Rival control of them. At war, this can be done more directly by military conquest on land, by Naval/Submarine blockade of trade routes at sea, and by Strategic Bombing of enemy Industry by air forces.&#10; The early phase of the game tends to revolve around: &#10;&bull; Diplomatic  infighting (using Action cards), to gain minor nations (Czech, Rumania, etc) for their Population and Resources, and &#10;&bull; Industrial buildup (via  Investment cards), with&#10;&bull; Military buildups (with the nature of forces being built being unknown to opponents),&#10;&bull; Technology  advancement (also via Investment cards), and some&#10;&bull; Military operations (using Action cards for Command), which can include Violating (attacking) neutral minors to gain Population/Resources when Diplomacy fails.&#10;&#10;If  the game continues peacefully due to imposing defenses or player inclination, pressure builds as players approach a Production of 20, as secret Peace Dividend chits may take someone over the 25 Victory threshold. Or players may succeed in developing the Atomic Bomb and steal a victory that way.&#10;&#10;At  some point, however, one Power (seeing opportunity or necessity) may Declare War on another. The victim gets immediate economic benefits in reaction, but military reality comes to the forefront from this point onward. The third party may well continue its economic development in peace. Or not.&#10;&#10;Unit movement is by Command card, which specifies a Command Priority letter that determines order of movement/combat and a Command Value number that  determines the maximum number of units that can be moved. Command cards are only valid during one specified Season (Spring/Summer/Fall), so a variety of Command cards in one&rsquo;s hand is necessary for a Power to be able to move in every Season. But HandSizes are limited, so each player must balance competing demands for card resources with military security.&#10;&#10;Combat occurs when rival units occupy the same area, and is executed by units firing in order by Type (defenders firing first amongst equal types), rolling dice for hits. Units have different Firepowers (hit values) depending on the Class of unit they are  targeting (ground, naval, air, sub). Land combat is one round per Season while sea battles are fought to a conclusion. Ground units without a Supply line lose 1 step per Season and cannot build (except Fortress units which are immune to both effects but cannot move).&#10;&#10;Triumph &amp; Tragedy is a true three-sided game: there is no requirement that the West and Russia be on the same side (and in fact there are valid reasons to attack each other), and only ONE player can win the game. Table talk is allowed (and encouraged) but agreements are not enforceable. Alliances are shifting and co-operation is undependable. The game can continue as an economic battle of attrition or a sudden military explosion can change everything. There is immense replayability as players can pursue dominance in Europe via land, sea or air military superiority, technological supremacy, or economic hegemony without rivals realizing their strategy until it is TOO LATE! It is a highly interactive, tense, fast-moving game with little downtime between player turns, covering THE crucial geopolitical decade of the 20th century in 4-6 hours.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	3	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/KuJMYH3VVj3BriDYaYvDQw__original/img/voKwWUbutxX0d3OGUaqHERXtb3Q=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2497742.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/KuJMYH3VVj3BriDYaYvDQw__thumb/img/79snZF_WwHakF2PPbOhXFLqjYLc=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2497742.jpg
1017	269511	Cooper Island	In the age of exploration the players arrive at a new home far away from their homeland. They try to settle the big island and each player tries to explore one part of it by placing landscape tiles. Landscape tiles grant resources and those are used to erect buildings with special abilities. Barriers on the island have to be removed in order to explore the island even further. Players build valuable statues and supply ships get them the supplies from the old world they need to be a successful settler on Cooper Island.&#10;&#10;The special thing about Cooper Island is the way the players mark their victory points. They sail with ships around the island to show their progress. On their way around the island they find smaller islands inshore that grant valuable benefits. After five rounds, a game of Cooper Island ends and the player who developed the best and went on furthest with their ships will win.&#10;&#10;&bull;&bull;&bull;&#10;&#10;The second printing of the German and English versions of the game, along with the Spanish version of the game, include the Solo Against Cooper expansion that was originally available separately as a bonus item.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;	\N	1	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/YDY6ZHqdRyDMvpfQO_jV7A__original/img/A11s0hdDTIG32lwT3d_7NLMHmM0=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4853982.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/YDY6ZHqdRyDMvpfQO_jV7A__thumb/img/AJf9NTVOgyXyntg2jjZW1FuR9aM=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4853982.jpg

1019	39351	Automobile	Automobile is a 3-5 player game that bears a modern setting when compared to most of Wallace&rsquo;s releases. Players are competing in the U.S. auto industry in the early 20th century, purchasing factories that turn out low-, medium- and high-valued vehicles, starting with the 1893 Duryea and moving through history from there.&#10;&#10;Each player knows a portion of the market demand each round and must make his purchasing and manufacturing decisions based on the information. Players can fund distributors across the country, but if they don&rsquo;t supply distributors with vehicles to sell, they go bankrupt, taking your investment with them.  Alternatively, players can drop the prices on their cars to move their market share, or even temporarily improve sales rates at the cost of research. Special action spaces are available that give a player a one-turn special ability with the actions provided by Ford, Durant, Kettering, and others somewhat related to their actual business history.&#10;&#10;As newer models make their way onto the market, they sell at the expense of the older models.  Older factories give inefficiency cubes as time passes, encouraging you to keep pace with technology.&#10;&#10;To get money, you need to build cars with your factories, but if you build more than there is demand they lose not only the money spent to make them, but gain inefficiency cubes that hurt them for the rest of the game. Whoever manages their car factories the best over this 120-150 minute game will win.&#10;&#10;	\N	3	5	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/lJOntTfaU-lbCZsFcRxA8A__original/img/lkZ8BBkTTqwEq6hK-mZrIQrscEE=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic744514.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/lJOntTfaU-lbCZsFcRxA8A__thumb/img/dUoQJ_WTooIEcPfMOi8E7Lt66_8=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic744514.jpg

1021	131357	Coup	You are head of a family in an Italian city-state, a city run by a weak and corrupt court. You need to manipulate, bluff and bribe your way to power. Your object is to destroy the influence of all the other families, forcing them into exile. Only one family will survive...&#10;&#10;In Coup, you want to be the last player with influence in the game, with influence being represented by face-down character cards in your playing area.&#10;&#10;Each player starts the game with two coins and two influence &ndash; i.e., two face-down character cards; the fifteen card deck consists of three copies of five different characters, each with a unique set of powers:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Duke: Take three coins from the treasury. Block someone from taking foreign aid.&#10;     Assassin: Pay three coins and try to assassinate another player's character.&#10;     Contessa: Block an assassination attempt against yourself.&#10;     Captain: Take two coins from another player, or block someone from stealing coins from you.&#10;     Ambassador: Draw two character cards from the Court (the deck), choose which (if any) to exchange with your face-down characters, then return two. Block someone from stealing coins from you.&#10;&#10;&#10;On your turn, you can take any of the actions listed above, regardless of which characters you actually have in front of you, or you can take one of three other actions:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Income: Take one coin from the treasury.&#10;     Foreign aid: Take two coins from the treasury.&#10;     Coup: Pay seven coins and launch a coup against an opponent, forcing that player to lose an influence. (If you have ten coins or more, you must take this action.)&#10;&#10;&#10;When you take one of the character actions &ndash; whether actively on your turn, or defensively in response to someone else's action &ndash; that character's action automatically succeeds unless an opponent challenges you. In this case, if you can't (or don't) reveal the appropriate character, you lose an influence, turning one of your characters face-up. Face-up characters cannot be used, and if both of your characters are face-up, you're out of the game.&#10;&#10;If you do have the character in question and choose to reveal it, the opponent loses an influence, then you shuffle that character into the deck and draw a new one, perhaps getting the same character again and perhaps not.&#10;&#10;The last player to still have influence &ndash; that is, a face-down character &ndash; wins the game!&#10;&#10;A new &amp; optional character called the Inquisitor has been added (currently, the only English edition with the Inquisitor included is the Kickstarter Version from Indie Boards &amp; Cards. Copies in stores may not be the Kickstarter versions and may only be the base game). The Inquisitor character cards may be used to replace the Ambassador cards.&#10;&#10;&#10;     Inquisitor: Draw one character card from the Court deck and choose whether or not to exchange it with one of your face-down characters. OR Force an opponent to show you one of their character cards (their choice which). If you wish it, you may then force them to draw a new card from the Court deck. They then shuffle the old card into the Court deck. Block someone from stealing coins from you.&#10;&#10;&#10;	\N	2	6	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/MWhSY_GOe2-bmlQ2rntSVg__original/img/ayAAWBK1rAEumARNmROsOtvqW-4=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2016054.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/MWhSY_GOe2-bmlQ2rntSVg__thumb/img/vuR_0PCX1w2EkjO_LbchOHZPOwU=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2016054.jpg

With that in mind, it&rsquo;s time to return to the beginning of one of the most epic adventures of all&hellip;&#10;&#10;With increased contents and some quality-of-life improvements, this new version of the classic LCG&rsquo;s core set is the perfect opportunity for a new player to dive into the game.&#10;&#10;The Revised Core Set includes cards to allow Campaign Mode (previous core set was strictly standalone scenarios), entirely new Boon and Burden mechanics that add cards that persist with the players from scenario to scenario, and full support for 4 players in the core box.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;	\N	1	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/2zRlYhLyzKmOLZ-ULOX9_Q__original/img/JBGAYcOk8xOYypLr5omDHgbKaFg=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic7132021.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/2zRlYhLyzKmOLZ-ULOX9_Q__thumb/img/Xtd2bt34MH-wIWVN_dobKvM7Rvs=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7132021.jpg
1023	155703	Evolution	In Evolution, players adapt their species in a dynamic ecosystem where food is scarce and predators lurk.  Traits like Hard Shell and Horns will protect your species from Carnivores, while a Long Neck will help them get food that others cannot reach. With over 4,000 ways to evolve your species, every game becomes a different adventure.&#10;&#10;Evolution packs a surprising amount of variety for a game with simple rules.  The variety comes from the synergies between the trait cards and from the different personalities at the table.  Some players thrive on creating Carnivores to wreak havoc on their fellow players.  Others prefer to stay protected and mind their own business.  Evolution encourages both play styles by giving each of them multiple paths to victory.  And it is the mix of play styles at the table that ultimately determines the ecosystem in which the players are adapting.  So gather your friends and see who can best adapt to the changing world around them.&#10;&#10;&quot;The theme of evolution is not just tacked on: it drives play.&quot; - Nature (the world's most prestigious scientific journal)  &#10;Evolution was covered in the journal Nature.  The article was written by Stuart West, a Professor of Evolutionary Biology at the University of Oxford who has used Evolution in his undergraduate class.  &#10;&#10;     https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1487263/evolution-and-other-evolution-themed-games-nature&#10;     https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1580710/using-game-evolution-teach-evolution&#10;&#10;&#10;	\N	2	6	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/wo_EYno7S66psGPMl_JtiQ__original/img/buKqUQr48Cb41noIhoaAJzWBLQA=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3543505.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/wo_EYno7S66psGPMl_JtiQ__thumb/img/_30uXRkyUuk9vMeeedlSqQ3oJwA=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3543505.jpg
1024	242705	Aeon Trespass: Odyssey	Aeon Trespass: Odyssey is a 1-4 player campaign game about adventures, exploration and fierce battles with giant monsters. It&rsquo;s a co-operative, choice-driven boardgame experience played over multiple sessions. Set in an alternate Antiquity, where a reality-shattering cataclysm killed the Olympian gods and unleashed the otherworldly Primordials, Aeon Trespass: Odyssey places the players in the roles of Argonauts, the only people who can fight off the darkness and make things right.&#10;&#10;Take control of the Argo and its crew, train them and send them on adventures into the dangerous and mysterious lands of Ancient Greece (and beyond...). Learn the world's secrets and create new technologies that will give you an edge in combat - and outside of it. Manage your resources and develop your base of operations. Build new Facilities, craft new Weapons and equipment. Gather allies and forge political alliances with the world&rsquo;s factions. And, most important of all, tame the Titans, arm them, evolve them and ride them to battle with the fearsome Primordials.&#10;&#10;You win by defeating the main villains or solving a crisis, you lose if your Argonauts die, your crew abandons you, your ship gets destroyed, the villains fulfill their plot or time runs out. There are many ways to lose, but only a handful paths to victory.&#10;&#10;During Battles, 1 to 4 players must cooperate to defeat 1 giant Primordial boss-type monster controlled by a sophisticated AI system.  Outside of Battles, Aeon Trespass: Odyssey uses choice chain and choice matrix mechanics to track your decisions throughout the game. Those decisions matter and will have a drastic impact on all future play sessions, campaigns and playthroughs.&#10;&#10;	\N	1	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/l5vgu2EcX8qm7_p9zhROuQ__original/img/Ua9vz7SNNj175jUlBuA0t7To1FQ=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4874391.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/l5vgu2EcX8qm7_p9zhROuQ__thumb/img/vcYzWxNUWKYSOCJKEgbv7vxAOe8=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4874391.jpg
1025	9625	Struggle of Empires	Struggle of Empires recreates the various wars fought between the European powers as they attempted to become the dominant force in Europe and the rest of the world during the eighteenth century.  Build armies and fleets, make alliances, establish colonies, improve your economy, and ultimately wage war to expand your empire.  Be careful, though, as a profligate country can end up being consumed by revolution.&#10;&#10;From the designer:&#10;Think of Civilization/Age of Renaissance set in the 18th century. Players take the role of one of the major powers of the period and fight in both Europe and the colonies. The twist to the game is that in each war, players must form into two alliances. Once allied with a player, you cannot fight each other. This means that you do not have the backstabbing of Diplomacy to worry about; if he's allied, he's with you until the end of the war. This means that a player has to think carefully about who he wants to fight against and who he wants to ally with. Very often he will want to ally with his natural enemy and go to war with the guy who doesn't really want to fight him. On top of this, you have lots of improvement tiles that you buy to shape your empire, plus alliances with minor powers, and the possibility of going into revolution. Even though it is a big empire building game, it will scale from 3 to 7 players and has pretty simple rules.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	7	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/V8J_bg9LKjB6as3Oxp_wtQ__original/img/1AabSD3BtD1N-JqFsmix6OIzTbo=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic5633386.png	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/V8J_bg9LKjB6as3Oxp_wtQ__thumb/img/FUyc1QhXpVQRkbAhouttIZstUZA=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5633386.png

When the Orders get too strong, King Philip will become nervous and disband all Templar orders, ending the game.&#10;&#10;Crusaders: Thy Will Be Done uses a combination of rondel and mancala mechanisms. Each player has their own rondel, which they can upgrade over the course of the game, that controls their action choices during the game.

It is not for a specific product or release. Versions will appear on the individual item pages.&#10;&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10; Star Wars: Destiny is a collectible dice and card game of battles between iconic heroes and villains that encompasses characters, locations, and themes from the entire Star Wars saga.&#10;&#10;In Star Wars: Destiny, two players engage in a fast-paced duel, each striving to eliminate the other's characters first. The game's innovative mechanisms combine dice-driven combat with faction-driven hand management. Straightforward rules make the game easy to learn, but also enable deep strategic thinking and clever deck-building. Players can create decks that include characters from every faction and any era, as long as heroes and villains are on opposite sides of the fight. For example, Padm&eacute; Amidala might fight alongside Rey and Finn, taking on Jabba the Hutt, Kylo Ren, and Jango Fett.&#10;&#10;Each round, you use your characters' abilities, an assortment of dice, and a carefully constructed thirty-card deck filled with events, upgrades, and supports. You and your opponent alternate actions: activating your dice, playing cards from your hand, attacking your foes, and claiming the battlefield. You need to prove your skills and defeat your opponent's characters to claim your destiny!&#10;&#10;At launch in November 2016, Star Wars: Destiny consists of two starter sets &mdash; Rey and Kylo Ren, each with nine dice and 24 cards &mdash; and the Awakenings booster packs, each containing one die and five cards.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;	\N	2	2	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/wXqxBwfHnCCkPA04L6g2Og__original/img/yNtbKiWfXeGy-_MuzMIQeMwI9bQ=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3363466.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/wXqxBwfHnCCkPA04L6g2Og__thumb/img/mVp0hoQwH5l1Llw8O24DAtVQFiQ=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3363466.jpg

Will Gandalf turn the tide for the Free Peoples? Will the Eagles arrive, or Beorn come to the rescue? Or will Bilbo the Hobbit perish in a last stand on Ravenhill?&#10;&#10;The Battle of Five Armies features a game board representing the Eastern and Southern spurs of the Lonely Mountain and the valley they encircle, and a number of plastic figures representing troops, heroes and monsters.&#10;&#10;The Battle of Five Armies is a standalone game based on the rules for War of the Ring, which is from the same designers, but with the rules modified to function on a tactical level as they describe a smaller battle rather than the entire war. Ares Games plans to expand the Battles game system in the future, releasing expansions depicting other battles from the Third Age of Middle-earth narrated in The Lord of the Rings, such as the Siege of Gondor and the assault of Saruman against Rohan.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	2	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/SQBx844N1Ay31pm368Ckkg__original/img/zu-ZhjwIQGzO7uK8Czt0xy4Ud-Y=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1886964.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/SQBx844N1Ay31pm368Ckkg__thumb/img/j5q6CR72Lqv4mkA-G1KKTBa9rYU=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1886964.jpg

1034	111799	Cuba Libre	In December 1956, paroled rebel Fidel Castro returned to Cuba to launch his revolution with virtually no political base and&mdash;after a disastrous initial encounter with government forces&mdash;a total of just 12 men.  Two years later, through masterful propaganda and factional maneuver, Castro, his brother Ra&uacute;l, and iconic revolutionary Che Guevara had united disparate guerrillas and exploited Cubans&rsquo; deep opposition to their dictator Fulgencio Batista y Zald&iacute;var.  Castro&rsquo;s takeover of the country became a model for Leftist insurgency.&#10;&#10;Castro&rsquo;s Insurgency&#10;&#10;Following up on GMT Games&rsquo; Andean Abyss about insurgency in modern Colombia, the next volume in the COIN Series, Cuba Libre, takes 1 to 4 players into the Cuban Revolution.  Castro&rsquo;s &ldquo;26 July Movement&rdquo; must expand from its bases in the Sierra Maestra mountains to fight its way to Havana.  Meanwhile, anti-communist student groups, urban guerrillas, and expatriates try to de-stabilize the Batista regime from inside and out, while trying not to pave the way for a new dictatorship under Castro.  Batista&rsquo;s Government must maintain steam to counter the twin insurgency, while managing two benefactors:  its fragile US Alliance and its corrupting Syndicate skim.  And in the midst of the turmoil, Meyer Lansky and his Syndicate bosses will jockey to keep their Cuban gangster paradise alive.&#10;&#10;COIN Series, Volume II&#10;&#10;Cuba Libre will be easy to learn for Andean Abyss players&mdash;both volumes share the same innovative Series: COIN (GMT) system.  Like Volume I, Cuba Libre is equally playable solitaire or by multiple players up to 4&mdash;and with a shorter time to completion than Andean Abyss.  But Cuba Libre&rsquo;s situation and strategic challenges will be new.  A deck of 48 fresh events brings 1950s Cuba to life and includes &hellip;&#10;&#10;&bull; The Twelve:  The first wave&rsquo;s escape to the Sierra Maestra&mdash;inspirational legend or harbinger of defeat?&#10;&bull; El Che and Ra&uacute;l:  Brilliant in the field, or bungling hostage-takers?&#10;&bull; Operation Fisherman:  Can the rebels pull off a second invasion?&#10;&bull; General Strike:  Urban disruption or rebel embarrassment?&#10;&bull; Radio Rebelde:  Are the masses tuning in, or just the Army direction finders?&#10;&bull; Pact of Caracas:  Can the rebels unite?&#10;&bull; Armored Cars:  Mobile striking power, but in whose hands?&#10;&bull; Rolando Masferrer:  Brutal pro-government tactics&mdash;will they help or hurt?&#10;&bull; Fat Butcher:  Can the Mob&rsquo;s enforcer protect its casinos?&#10;&bull; Sinatra:  Frankie&rsquo;s Havana show a boom or bust, and who collects?&#10;&hellip; and much more.&#10;&#10;New twists match the COIN Series system to the situation in 1950s Cuba:&#10;&#10;&bull; It&rsquo;s the insurgents who build lasting capabilities, while the Government is limited to fleeting bursts of momentum.&#10;&bull; The Syndicate&rsquo;s bases are Casinos&mdash;expensive to build, but so important to Cuba no army will destroy them.  &#10;&bull; Syndicate special activities include calling in the &ldquo;muscle&rdquo; of Government troops and police to protect mob assets.  &#10;&bull; Stacks of Syndicate cash awaiting launder can fall in anyone&rsquo;s hands&mdash;even the corrupt Government&rsquo;s.&#10;&bull; The Government has its own terror tactic&mdash;reprisals&mdash;and can skim a portion of Syndicate profits.&#10;&bull; The eroding US Alliance with Batista overshadows all Government actions, not just through aid levels but also through the day-to-day ability of troops and police to operate.&#10;&bull; Even if Batista flees, the struggle may not end&mdash;the counterrevolutionary government may even become stronger!&#10;&#10;Multiplayer, 2-Player, Solitaire&#10;&#10;Cuba Libre provides up to 4 players with contrasting roles and overlapping victory conditions for rich diplomatic interaction. For 2- or 3-player games, players can represent alliances of factions, or the game system can control non-player factions . Or a single player as the Cuban Revolutionaries can attempt to topple Batista and seize power for themselves. The non-player sides will fight one another as well as the players, but too much power in the hands of any one of them will mean player defeat.&#10;&#10;More COIN Series Volumes to Come&#10;&#10;Andean Abyss and now Cuba Libre present a game system on modern insurgency readily adaptable to other conflicts, particularly those featuring the interaction of many sides (thus the name COunterINsurgency Series). A rich and under-represented history of guerrilla warfare beckons, as modern insurgency offers virtually unlimited, under-gamed topics for the COIN Series.  Volume III is A Distant Plain&#226;&#128;&#148;Insurgency in Afghanistan.  Volume IV is Fire in the Lake&#226;&#128;&#148;Insurgency in Vietnam.&#10;&#10;	\N	1	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/6z5ZMIVpFUzn1DHhto3RLw__original/img/Pj0LixQN2LDDFZ2OQGa_XfwDPWc=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1723711.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/6z5ZMIVpFUzn1DHhto3RLw__thumb/img/Zsirgs7exejEoHOaAYhUZMALGUU=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1723711.jpg
1035	160010	Conan	Conan, designed by Fred Henry and based on the Conan universe by Robert E. Howard, is a scenario-based semi-cooperative asymmetric miniatures board game. One player is the Overlord, playing the opposition forces, and the other players (1 to 4) play Conan and his companions: Shevatas the thief, Hadrathus the Priest/Sorcerer, Belit the pirate queen, Valeria the warrior, etc. The game is based purely on Robert E. Howard's novels and short stories (and not the movies or other non-Howardian material). The publisher has hired Patrice Louinet, a Howard expert, to make sure the art and the scenarios are compatible with Howard's vision.&#10;&#10;Each game is a scenario, played on a map. There are 4 maps included in the retail copy of the game, and each map can have several scenarios set on it. The game is fast, one hour approximately. It's possible to play several scenarios in a campaign, but you can also play each scenario individually. There are 9 scenarios in the base box.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of a scenario, players choose their team (Conan and two or three other heroes). The Overlord gathers all the miniatures (picts, Necromancer, skeleton warriors, monsters, etc.), tokens, and cards from the chosen scenario. The game usually plays in a limited number of turns (ten, for instance). Each scenario can have very different objectives: find the princess captured by picts and hidden in a hut and leave the camp before the pict hunters return; find the magical key to open a sealed door, steal the jewel and leave; kill the Necromancer by the end of turn 10; survive by the end of turn 10; escape the prison; etc.&#10;&#10;During their turn, the heroes can activate or rest. If they activate, they can spend &quot;gems&quot; from their energy pool to do all sorts of actions: move, fight (melee or distance), defend, pick a lock, reroll, etc. If they rest, they can move a lot of gems from their &quot;spent&quot; pool box to their &quot;available&quot; pool box. When they take an action, they throw a number of dice equal to the number of gems they put in their action. There are three different kinds of dice: yellow (the weaker dice), orange (medium) and red (strong). Each character has a color based on their specialty: Conan throws red dice in combat while the Sorcerer throws yellow dice in combat; the thief throws red dice in Manipulation actions, while Conan throws orange dice; etc. Each player can have equipment cards (armor, magic potions, weapons, etc.) which give them bonuses on their dice rolls.&#10;&#10;The Overlord plays differently. He uses a board with eight slidable tiles, plus his own Energy gems. Each tile corresponds to one unit (1 to 3 miniatures) on the game mat, and all of the miniature abilities are written on this tile (movement, armor, attack, special abilities). The tile position on the board corresponds to the numbers 1-8. The Overlord has a pool of energy gems and each time he activates one unit, he needs to spend a number of gems matching the tile placement: tile#1 costs 1 energy gem, tile#2 costs 2 gems, etc. Whatever tile the Overlord chooses to activate, he spends the corresponding energy cost (moving his energy gems from the available pool to the spent pool), then takes the tile out and moves it to the end of the sliding track: If he wants to activate this unit again, it will cost him 8 gems, because the unit is now on position 8. The Overlord can activate a maximum of two tiles, and he regains only a certain number of gems each turn (depending on the scenario).&#10;&#10;In a typical scenario, the heroes need to accomplish something and the Overlord wins if the heroes fail to reach their objective &mdash; but in some scenarios, the Overlord has his own objectives and the Heroes win if they prevent him from accomplishing his goal.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	5	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/x0VJACjymxo4boRichVVKQ__original/img/J6IDtxBCyRLBOf_H8MH__g2xm5c=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3118623.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/x0VJACjymxo4boRichVVKQ__thumb/img/RmO8s9A4mxFlU37HD-8h4IhQN8U=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3118623.jpg
1036	6472	A Game of Thrones	Description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;War and chaos are engulfing the lands of Westeros. The great Houses are vying for control of the Iron Throne using the old tools of intrigue and war. Yet while the war for Westeros rages, grave dangers gather in the cold North, and an ancient enemy is gaining momentum in the distant East.&#10;&#10;In A Game of Thrones: The Board Game, players take control of one of the great Houses of Westeros. Via resource management, diplomacy, and cunning, they seek to win dominance over the land. Players must give orders to armies, control important characters, gather resources for the coming winter, and survive the onslaught of their enemies. A unique phase mechanic, battle resolution, and special ordering system make for an engaging game in which all players are actively involved at all times.&#10;&#10;Reimplemented by:&#10;&#10;     A Game of Thrones: The Board Game (Second Edition) (2011)&#10;&#10;&#10;	\N	3	5	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Gr3qfzoK-428kv1M9WUG1Q__original/img/8TVCyztBT_50oYKLtC7dYTxDGnU=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1222116.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Gr3qfzoK-428kv1M9WUG1Q__thumb/img/ggRHe5WjwRhEIRtWI2TJBX-HPic=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1222116.jpg
1039	113924	Zombicide	Zombicide is a collaborative game in which players take the role of a survivor &ndash; each with unique abilities &ndash; and harness both their skills and the power of teamwork against the hordes of unthinking undead! Zombies are predictable, stupid but deadly, controlled by simple rules and a deck of cards. Unfortunately for you, there are a LOT more zombies than you have bullets.&#10;&#10;Find weapons, kill zombies. The more zombies you kill, the more skilled you get; the more skilled you get, the more zombies appear.

1040	432	Take 5	In 6 nimmt!, a.k.a. Category 5 and many other names, you want to score as few points as possible.&#10;&#10;To play the game, you shuffle the 104 number cards, lay out four cards face-up to start the four rows, then deal ten cards to each player. Each turn, players simultaneously choose and reveal a card from their hand, then add the cards to the rows, with cards being placed in ascending order based on their number; specifically, each card is placed in the row that ends with the highest number that's below the card's number. When the sixth card is placed in a row, the owner of that card claims the other five cards and the sixth card becomes the first card in a new row.&#10;&#10;In addition to a number from 1 to 104, each card has a point value. After finishing ten rounds, players tally their score and see whether the game ends. (Category 5 ends when a player has a score greater than 74, for example, while 6 nimmt! ends when someone tops 66.) When this happens, the player with the fewest points wins!&#10;&#10;6 nimmt! works with 2-10 players, and the dynamics of gameplay change the more players that you have. One variant for the game has you use 34 cards, 44 cards, 54 cards, etc. (instead of all 104 cards) when you have three, four, five, etc. number of players. This change allows you to know which cards are in play, thereby allowing you to track which cards have been played and (theoretically) make better choices as to which card to play when.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	10	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/fejfmCLX0kSSKppT5iv_Pg__original/img/E982nMiCQhBmIqyP7BiKITx-om4=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic7649146.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/fejfmCLX0kSSKppT5iv_Pg__thumb/img/dWcwk0P0dT5AujK4CiYP_A2d93A=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7649146.jpg
1041	30869	Thebes	Thebes is a game of competitive archeology. Players are archaeologists who must travel around Europe, northern Africa, and the Middle East to acquire knowledge about five ancient civilizations -- the Greeks, the Cretans, the Egyptians, the Palestinians, and the Mesopotamians -- and then must use this knowledge to excavate historical sites in the areas of these civilizations. Through the course of the game, expositions are revealed, and an archaeologist who has treasures from the requisite civilizations may claim the prize (this is a change from the first edition's handling of exhibitions). The archaeologist who learns the most about the civilizations, claims the greatest-valued artifacts, and collects the most exhibitions will win out over his or her colleagues.&#10;&#10;The key element to the game is that it is played out over a period of two (or three) years, and each action a player performs takes a certain amount of time -- traveling is a week between cities, gathering knowledge takes time for the level of the knowledge, and actually digging at a cultural site takes time to yield a certain number of artifact tiles. The game uses a novel mechanism to keep track of this. There is a track of 52 spaces around the outside of the board. Each time a player moves and takes an action, he or she moves their player token forward in time. Players take turns based on being the one who is furthest back in &quot;time&quot;. So, a player can go to an excavation site and spend 10 weeks digging for artifacts, but that will also mean that the other players will likely be taking several actions in the interim while that player waits for the &quot;time&quot; to catch up.&#10;&#10;In addition, the artifact tiles for each civilization are drawn from a bag that also contains dirt.  When a player excavates a site, that player pulls tiles from the bag, but some may only be worthless dirt instead of valuable treasure. That dirt is then returned to the bag, making the first draw more likely to provide useful tiles.&#10;&#10;This is the new entry for the Queen printing of Jenseits von Theben.  As the new game changes several mechanisms of the original, and is available in a much wider release, the two games should be regarded as separate entities.&#10;&#10;Re-implements:&#10;&#10;    Jenseits von Theben&#10;&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/T4EH02wIepQC4DzyEEY1MQ__original/img/QxPqkxizF0ZN4crTiw_OukDV8c4=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2723204.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/T4EH02wIepQC4DzyEEY1MQ__thumb/img/oQ0IlYEVkHSnCPvoORuPAjzCCy8=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2723204.jpg
1042	190082	Whitehall Mystery	October 1888: During the construction of the Metropolitan Police headquarters near Whitehall, which would later be known as Scotland Yard, the remains of a body were found. In September, a severed arm had already been discovered in the muddy shore of the River Thames.&#10;&#10;There is another murderer roaming the streets of London in Whitehall, amusing himself by spreading the pieces of a poor woman around Whitehall, like some kind of macabre treasure hunt. The identity of this monster and his unfortunate victim are a mystery, the Whitehall Mystery.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/LA-CPp3BnCHkJa8ut85aIQ__original/img/0OqPWgqiD32midVjoYvwTvHZ62Y=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3360633.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/LA-CPp3BnCHkJa8ut85aIQ__thumb/img/jva8lwK8a53YcK0fC7pSdr2iV3c=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3360633.jpg
1043	143519	Quantum	Send out the scouts! Position the Flagship in tactical orbit! And reconfigure that Battlestation into something new! Your fleet of loyal ships, powered by the might of quantum  probability itself, carries your empire to the far-flung stars. How will history remember you? As a ravenous destroyer? A clever tactician? A dauntless explorer? Command your armada, construct world-shattering technologies, and rally the remnants of humanity for a final confrontation.&#10;&#10;In Quantum, each player is a fleet commander from one of the four factions of humanity, struggling to conquer a sector of space. Every die is a starship, with the value of the die determining the movement of the ship, but also its combat power - with low numbers more powerful. So a [ 6 ] is a quick but fragile Scout and a [ 1 ] is a slow but mighty Battlestation.&#10;&#10;Each type of ship also has a special power that can be used once per turn: Destroyers can warp space to swap places with other dice and Flagships can transport other ships. These powers can be used in combination for devastating effects. You're not stuck with your starting ships, however: using Quantum technology, you can spend actions to transform (re-roll) your ships. Randomness plays a role in the game, but only when you want: Quantum is very much a strategy game.&#10;&#10;You win by constructing Quantum Cubes - massive planetary energy extractors. Each time you build a new one, you can expand your fleet, earn a new permanent ability, or take a one-time special move. The board itself is made out of modular tiles, and you can play on one of the 30 layouts that come with the game or design your own. The ship powers, player abilities, and board designs combine to create a limitless set of possibilities for how to play and strategies for how to win.&#10;&#10;With elegant mechanics, an infinity of scenarios, and easy-to-learn rules that lead to deep gameplay, Quantum is a one-of-a-kind game of space combat, strategy and colonization that will satisfy both hard-core and casual players.&#10;&#10;Quantum won the 2012 Game Design Award at the IndieCade Festival of Independent Games, as a prototype game with the title Armada d6.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Bgle3gjd2wTrD31ps_z92w__original/img/VWKSSnMFxzSIdQ7W6hrdw_VCKmI=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1727619.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Bgle3gjd2wTrD31ps_z92w__thumb/img/bjSkZpezCxJBqtucXslJAX2laKA=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1727619.jpg
1044	244115	Shards of Infinity	One-hundred years ago, The Infinity Engine was shattered and its reality-bending shards have destroyed most of the world. Now, it falls upon you to gather your forces, defeat your adversaries, and rebuild the Infinity Engine! Will you survive?&#10;&#10;Shards of Infinity combines an unprecedented level of strategy and customization into one small box. Rather than competing for points, players must outlast their opponents and reduce their health to zero, which can be done in a number of ways. Each player starts the game with a basic deck of cards, and they can acquire new cards from a central display of six cards (as in Ascension) and add these new cards to their deck or use them immediately, depending on what they are.&#10;&#10;Every character starts with fifty health and zero mastery. On each turn, you can spend one gem (a.k.a., money) to gain a mastery point. The more mastery you have, the more powerful your cards become. This lets even the weak cards in your starting deck become more powerful as the game progresses. If you reach a total of thirty mastery, you can activate your Infinity Shard, which instantly defeats your opponent.&#10;&#10;As you acquire new cards, you can employ allies and champions to craft your strategy. Mercenary cards can be added to your deck as in other deck-building games or they can be played immediately from the center row for their ability; this adds even more drama to each player's turn as a key mercenary flip can alter the very outcome of the game!&#10;&#10;Will you neutralize your opponents before they can fully master the Infinity Shard? With careful planning and aggressive gameplay, only one player can emerge the winner!&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/GfQBoqOl21zQx-Vy-dSHZw__original/img/OFsvutVOnXspJgkpSfw27Wx-AmA=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic4064509.png	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/GfQBoqOl21zQx-Vy-dSHZw__thumb/img/YIrtck-_LqOn5Me4cbn8TWk-9UA=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4064509.png
1045	212445	Blood Bowl (2016 Edition)	Description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;Blood Bowl is a game of Fantasy Football. The basic game features a match between two teams drawn from a number of fantasy archetypes, playing a warped version of American Football.&#10;&#10;The Blood Bowl boxed game contains two teams: Humans, an all-round team who are flexible enough to adapt to any style of play, or Orcs, who make up in brute force what they lack in finesse. The teams are represented by coloured plastic miniatures, and push-fit assembly is required before use. The game is expandable, and additional rules and teams will be made available through expansion sets and supplements.&#10;&#10;Actions in the game are resolved through the use of dice. Regular six-sided dice are used to make tests in a number of cases, such as when a player attempts to pick up the ball, pass it, catch it or dodge past an enemy player. Custom dice are used when one player wishes to Block another, using graphics to represent each of the different (but all violent) potential outcomes.&#10;&#10;The rules in this edition of Blood Bowl are almost identical to those found in the Competition Rules Pack, which was the culmination of several years of development of the Blood Bowl Living Rulebook. This has resulted in an incredibly well-honed game which sees regular competition play around the world. In fact each team takes turns moving, blocking and advancing the football down the field. The game comes with plastic miniatures.&#10;&#10;This game is a part of the Blood Bowl Series.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	2	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/1To3fG0-1ZpX1vfcHGHHYg__original/img/etLhChO09NvKGH9-c04Jw3Q92Xk=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3254491.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/1To3fG0-1ZpX1vfcHGHHYg__thumb/img/CmBNLOWNnA-qMjMUZ-39OsNpD9w=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3254491.jpg
1046	5782	Coloretto	Game play in Coloretto is simple: Either draw a card to play to a row, or take a row of cards to add them to your collection. A row can have at most three cards, so at some point everyone is forced to take a row. Once all the rows have been claimed, players start a new round, drawing or taking once again.&#10;&#10;What are you trying to do with these cards? Collect huge sets - but only in three colors as every color beyond the third will cost you points. Jokers are highly-prized as they always match what you want, and +2 cards provide sure points, giving you a back-up plan if everything goes south in terms of the colors you're collecting.&#10;&#10;Once only a few cards remain in the deck, the round ends and everyone tallies their score, choosing three colors of cards to score positively while any other colors count against you. Each color is scored using a triangular number system: the first card in a color is &plusmn;1 point, the second card is &plusmn;2 points, and so on. The player with the high score wins!&#10;&#10;A two-player variant is included with some versions of Coloretto, with the only change being that rows can have only 1-3 cards placed in them, depending on the icons on the row cards.&#10;&#10;Nordic version include extensions: 'Coloretto: The Extra Cards', 'Coloretto: The Limit Cards' and 'Coloretto for two players'.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	5	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/pd3qaiROSgTJ5js_0e4Nhw__original/img/W1cSDjB5Bi9bGhl3VRxQSP_Vw54=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic6653783.png	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/pd3qaiROSgTJ5js_0e4Nhw__thumb/img/SveyL9J1DT0hX4ucYWjRR6DMrbk=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6653783.png

1048	699	HeroQuest	HeroQuest is Milton Bradley's approach to a Dungeons &amp; Dragons-style adventure game.  One player acts as game master, revealing the maze-like dungeon piecemeal as the players wander.  Up to four other players take on a character (wizard, elf, dwarf, or barbarian) and venture forth into dungeons on fantasy quests.  Plastic miniatures and 3-D furniture make this game very approachable.  Expansions were also released for this system.&#10;&#10;The HeroQuest series consists of the main game and a number of expansions.&#10;&#10;This game was made in cooperation with Games Workshop who designed the miniatures and helped in many of the production details including background world and art in the rule book and scenario book.&#10;&#10;Additional material which is generally missed since it is not technically an expansion was published in the HeroQuest: Adventure Design Kit which did feature one more Heroquest adventure: A Plague of Zombies.&#10;&#10;Other sources of HeroQuest supplements which are available (in some cases online.)&#10;&#10;&#10;

1049	224710	Zombicide: Green Horde	This sequel to the Zombicide: Black Plague will bring players back into a world of deadly medieval fantasy, this time filled with infected orcs and goblins who will put survivors to the ultimate test. This green menace is not only stronger than their human counterparts, but they also tend to gather into massive hordes that ambush the survivors when they least expect it.&#10;&#10;Set in the same medieval era as Black Plague, players will take on the role of Survivors looking to defeat the shuffling, undead menace by any means possible.&#10;&#10;In Green Horde, up to six players can join the battle for survival. They&rsquo;ll combine forces and work cooperatively to accomplish their goals, and against all odds, stay alive. Fans of the Zombicide series have become familiar with the Walkers, Runners, Fatties, and Abominations that shuffle around, looking for victims. But the creatures they will face are not just zombie humans, they&rsquo;re zombie orcs! The Survivors will have to gear up with a wide variety of medieval equipment if they hope to outlast these fearsome foes. Zombie Orcs are stronger than the classic zombie and represent a stiffer challenge to even seasoned undead-hunting veterans.&#10;&#10;A new challenge for the Survivors is the Horde. It represents a growing group of Orc zombies that are ready to enter the board in an unexpected location and ambush the Survivors. As zombie cards with the Horde symbol are drawn, one extra zombie miniature of the same type is set aside, collectively forming the Horde. They will be locked into place until an &ldquo;Enter the Horde!&rdquo; card is drawn, spawning the Horde on the board. Any Survivor caught on their own near this roving menace would best beat a hasty retreat.&#10;&#10;With such menacing new foes, the Survivors are going to have their hands full dealing with the Green Horde. Luckily, they&rsquo;ll have some new weapons and spells on their side to help combat the rotting masses. Things like the Lava Burst, the Norse Sword, and the Bone Kukri will all be helpful when hacking through a pack of the undead. Oh, and if they should gather together too tightly, the Survivors can always hit them with the catapult...(did we not mention the catapult?).&#10;&#10;Zombicide: Green Horde includes ten new challenging quests, featuring some of the toughest scenarios a Survivor has ever had to face. With new terrain, like ledges and water holes, and the ever-present threat of the Green Horde making an appearance, the team will have to plan their routes carefully. Sometimes avoiding trouble is better than facing it head on! Zombicide: Green Horde is the next chapter in the ever-evolving world of Zombicide. There&rsquo;s no rest for the Survivors if they hope to battle their way to a new hope and a new beginning.&#10;&#10;	\N	1	6	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/rtJTab2_kHN2k4_nUddRTQ__original/img/Xs4zH6y3WpZ8XFq-X4T1p5XWncY=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3564805.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/rtJTab2_kHN2k4_nUddRTQ__thumb/img/H17dequj7LYB-NKcZo352sAxQ3k=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3564805.jpg
1061	379078	Expeditions	The sequel to Scythe sends players on a new adventure into Siberia, where a massive meteorite crashed near the Tunguska River, awakening ancient corruption. An expedition led by Dr. Tarkovsky ventures into the taiga to learn about the meteorite and its impact on the land. Itching for adventure, heroes from the war privately fund their own expeditions to Siberia, hoping to find artifacts, overcome challenges, and ultimately achieve glory. Expeditions has completely different mechanisms than Scythe, though the goal was to capture some of the same feelings that Scythe evokes, with a slightly darker, more supernatural theme.&#10;&#10;Expeditions is a competitive, card-driven, engine-building game of exploration. Play cards to gain power, guile, and unique worker abilities; move your mech to mysterious locations and gain cards found among the tiles; use workers, items, meteorites, and quests to enhance your mech; and use power and guile to vanquish corruption.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;	\N	1	5	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/9eBww9iAi472T2goijVqwQ__original/img/uvxTECY9yY2ONOllPgv7xLZCrGU=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic7320023.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/9eBww9iAi472T2goijVqwQ__thumb/img/xR6PqvTMNBFaGlnN9WDAeIooBNM=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7320023.jpg
1050	336794	Galaxy Trucker (Second Edition)	In the fast and goofy family game Galaxy Trucker, players begin by simultaneously rummaging through the common warehouse, frantically trying to grab the most useful component tiles to build their spaceship &mdash; all in real-time.&#10;&#10;Once the ships are launched, players encounter dangerous situations while vying for financial opportunities, each hoping to gain the most valuable cargo and finish with as much of their ship still intact as possible. Of course, that's easier said than done since many hazards will send pieces of your ship, your cargo, and your crew hurling into the depths of space.&#10;&#10;The goal is to survive the trek &mdash; hopefully with at least some of your crew and ship intact &mdash; and have at least one credit by the end of the game. (Profit, yay!) Players earn credits by delivering goods, defeating pirates, having the best-looking ship, and reaching their destination before the others.&#10;&#10;This version of Galaxy Trucker is a relaunch of the original 2007 release by Vlaada Chv&aacute;til that features new art, more ship tiles, tweaked card effects, and streamlined gameplay that consists of only a single flight through space. That said, should you want a longer, more challenging experience, you can play a three-flight game known as the &quot;Transgalactic Trek&quot;.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/1gQABuftAVgk1qshkMyDEw__original/img/7GY1ZXeZkWkWki5QLAbfdX-EGp0=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic6125184.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/1gQABuftAVgk1qshkMyDEw__thumb/img/Ovni6sWuvyfj9LWn-hnHzpCELF8=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6125184.jpg
1051	552	Bus	Prior to Essen 1999, a group of students created Splotter Spellen to sell some of their own game designs.  This game is regarded as one of the highlights of that group.  The object of the game is to deliver as many people to their destinations as you can.  To accomplish this, players place route markers on the board to connect passengers to their destinations.  However, the destination types (work, bar, home) vary from turn to turn, so you can follow certain passengers as they make their way through the daily grind.&#10;&#10;Players may buy more buses (they start off with one), build onto their bus route, bring new passengers to the city (via the trains), expand the city by adding more buildings, and run their buses. There is another option, the clock. The action board has one other clever feature. On some actions, route expansion and building, the first player to choose that action actually gets to execute the action last! Which leads to some interesting games of chicken and some painful decisions.&#10;&#10;Buying more buses allows a player to carry one more passenger every time they run their buses - hence scoring, in the best case, one more point. Depending on how the city gets built, however, finding lots of passengers on the street can be tricky.&#10;&#10;Bus routes extend from either end of a Settlers-style initial placement. Extensions are appended to either end. Routes may only run parallel if there are no empty streets at one of the ends or the line ends on the crossing as another player's end. All new passengers will arrive at one of two train stations so that is one concern when route building. One must also be careful to run by a nice mix of building types. And, when building, one must always have an eye towards spoiling other players' routes by placing a mix of building types at each of their intersection so that all of their passengers just walk! Finally, when carrying passengers, one wants to be careful to set up to carry the same passenger next turn.&#10;&#10;	\N	3	5	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/kdUgrIW97AMy0X_ZAXKBIQ__original/img/xzDBpZR94KRpjiKJRW5ZqYWKmMo=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4908538.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/kdUgrIW97AMy0X_ZAXKBIQ__thumb/img/4M7epe99tiI_bvQGRPMo7OvxSko=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4908538.jpg
1052	169255	A Game of Thrones: The Card Game (Second Edition)	In A Game of Thrones: The Card Game, the warring factions of Westeros await your command, inviting you to engage in a life-or-death struggle. In every game, you select devious plots and challenge your opponents on the field of battle, through back alley intrigue, and in the political arena. Whether you play a against a single opponent, in a game known as a joust, or engage in a battle of three or more players, called a melee, winning challenges against your opponents is the way to victory.&#10;&#10;Your ultimate goal in A Game of Thrones: The Card Game is to gain influence over the greatest seat of power in Westeros: the Iron Throne! To achieve this goal, you must call upon iconic characters, such as Tywin Lannister, Robb Stark, Stannis Baratheon, Daenerys Targaryen, Euron Crow's Eye, The Red Viper, and dozens of others. You must maneuver the members of your House and your allies in a constant battle to gain power. The first player to claim fifteen power wins!&#10;&#10;In the game, each player has two decks: a draw deck and a plot deck. Your draw deck contains the tactical elements of your struggle, including the characters, locations, attachments, and events that you call upon in your struggle to claim the Iron Throne. You can command characters from throughout A Song of Ice and Fire, and you can march forth from the icy walls of Winterfell or muster your armies around Casterly Rock. You may even equip your characters with storied weapons, such as the Valyrian steel blades Ice or Widow's Wail. The draw deck holds these powerful characters, locations, attachments, and events. This deck is randomly shuffled and players draw their hands from this deck.&#10;&#10;At the start of each round, each player simultaneously chooses and reveals one of the plot cards from their individual seven-card plot decks. Your plot for a round determines how much gold you can spend on cards, which player starts with initiative, and how powerful your challenges are. Your plot also bears a reserve value, which determines how many cards you can keep in your hand past the end of the round. Plots may also offer powerful effects that can trigger when the plots are revealed or persist to shape the entire game round. You may scorch the earth with a deadly wildfire assault, or call upon all players to support the faith of the Seven.&#10;&#10;A Game of Thrones: The Card Game (Second Edition) differs from the first edition of the game due to elements being cut, elements being revised or updated, and elements being added. Influence was a holdover from the game's origin as a CCG and is now unnecessary, while crests offered nothing to distinguish them from traits and made the game more difficult for new players to learn. Existing keywords have been pruned, and some new keywords have been added to showcase the most interesting and essential interactions.&#10;&#10;The timing rules &mdash; such as the details of moribund, passive effects with triggers, and save/cancel responses &mdash; will be replaced with a more straightforward timing system that takes advantage of the Interrupt, Reaction, and Forced triggers that have been successfully employed in some of FFG's newer LCGs.&#10;&#10;The second edition also includes two new factions beyond the six Houses in the first edition. New deck-building rules empower players with more options in combining factions, alongside a means of building more focused and specialized plot decks.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/2gP4Uti9RPquZVlweeapLw__original/img/BBz4zQ1fTrQtAs_lr39MF6ia-Og=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2783386.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/2gP4Uti9RPquZVlweeapLw__thumb/img/fe1ELDopk_qSeiDruI0hs8nmzSQ=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2783386.jpg
1053	174785	Mare Nostrum: Empires	The ancient Romans called the Mediterranean Sea &quot;mare nostrum&quot;, which is Latin for &quot;our sea&quot;.&#10;&#10;Mare Nostrum is an empire-building game in which 3-5 players [or 2-6 with the 'Atlas' expansion] lead their individual ancient empires to dominion of Mare Nostrum. You grow the fame and glory of your empire by expanding your influence into new Provinces, then extending your Trade Caravans, building Markets, and founding new Cities and Temples. You can recruit Heroes and create Wonders to help your cause. But beware of your &quot;friends&quot; because they may look upon your gains with envy and greed...&#10;&#10;Mare Nostrum is a re-introduction by Academy Games and Asyncron of the original 2003 release with updated rules, counters, and map board. This edition includes many new components and multiple new ways to win!&#10;&#10;In more detail, you choose an empire to lead, which begins with three Provinces. You can lead with Caesar of Rome and its powerful Legions, or with Pericles, the prominent Greek statesman and orator, with the great Babylonian lawgiver and healer King Hammurabi, or with Queen Cleopatra of Egypt, whose engineers led in the development of grain storage and irrigation, or with Hannibal, leader of the Carthaginians, whose merchants thrived on trade and commerce. Now you decide how you will grow your empire. You can do this by:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Expanding your Trade and creating Wonders.&#10;    Concentrating on Culture and building the great Pyramids.&#10;    Developing a strong and powerful Military to occupy the Provinces of other empires, or &#10;    Exerting Political Leadership by claiming the titles of Trade Leader, Cultural Leader, and Military Leader.&#10;&#10;&#10;	\N	3	5	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/bCT1a-L84zgHRsIkNdH-lA__original/img/llYdd4trnj2VZSx8KHrt2d1LNQU=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2648963.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/bCT1a-L84zgHRsIkNdH-lA__thumb/img/dTt5RE3rxMyv3pe6_DslE-DEboY=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2648963.jpg

1077	257501	KeyForge: Call of the Archons	From the imagination of legendary game designer Richard Garfield comes a game unlike anything the world has ever seen&mdash;a game where every deck is as unique as the person who wields it and no two battles will ever be the same. This is KeyForge, where deckbuilding and boosters are a thing of the past, where you can carve a path of discovery with every deck, where you can throw yourself into the game with the force of a wild wormhole and embrace the thrill of a tactical battle where wits will win the day!&#10;&#10;Along with this new breed of game comes a new world: the Crucible, an artificial world built from the pieces of countless planets across the stars. Here, anything is possible. This world was built for the Archons, god-like beings who, for all their power, know little about their own origins. The Archons clash in constant struggles, leading motley companies of various factions as they seek to find and unlock the planet&rsquo;s hidden Vaults to gain ultimate knowledge and power.&#10;&#10;This starter set contains two starter decks, two unique Archon Decks, and all the keys and tokens two players need to play!&#10;&#10;KeyForge: Call of the Archons is the world's first Unique Deck Game. Every single Archon Deck that you'll use to play is truly unique and one-of-a kind, with its own Archon and its own mixture of cards in the deck. If you pick up an Archon Deck, you know that you're the only person in existence with access to this exact deck and its distinct combination of cards. In fact, in just the first set of KeyForge: Call of the Archons, there are more than 104 quadrillion possible decks!&#10;&#10;Every Archon Deck contains a full play experience with a deck that cannot be altered, meaning it's ready to play right out of the box. Not only does this remove the need for deckbuilding or boosters, it also creates a new form of gameplay with innovative mechanics that challenges you to use every card in your deck to find the strongest and most cunning combinations. It is not the cards themselves that are powerful, but rather the interactions between them&mdash;interactions that can only be found in your deck. Your ability to make tough tactical decisions will determine your success as you and your opponent trade blows in clashes that can shift in an instant!&#10;&#10;KeyForge: Call of the Archons is played over a series of turns in which you, as the Archon leading your company, use the creatures, technology, artifacts, and skills of a chosen House to reap precious &AElig;mber, hold off your enemy's forces, and forge enough keys to unlock the Crucible's Vaults. You begin your turn by declaring one of the three Houses within your deck, and for the remainder of the turn you may play and use cards only from that House. For example, if you take on the role of the Archon Radiant Argus the Supreme, you will find cards from Logos, Sanctum, and Untamed in your deck, but if you declare &quot;Sanctum&quot; at the start of your turn, you may use actions, artifacts, creatures, and upgrades only from Sanctum. Your allies from Logos and Untamed must wait.&#10;&#10;Next, you must strive to gain the advantage with a series of tactical decisions, leveraging both the cards in your hand and those in play to race ahead of your opponent. If you wish to weaken your rival&rsquo;s forces, you may send out your allies to fight enemies on the opposing side, matching strength against strength. Otherwise, you may choose to use your followers to reap, adding more &AElig;mber to your pool.&#10;&#10;Notably, no card in KeyForge has a cost &mdash; choosing a House at the start of a turn allows you to play and use any number of cards from that House for free, leading turns to fly by with a wave of activity! Yet balance is key. If you simply reap more &AElig;mber at every opportunity, your rival may quickly grow their team of minions and destroy yours, outpacing your collection and leaving your field barren. But if you focus on the thrill of the fight alone and neglect the collection of &AElig;mber, you won't move any closer to your goal! If you succeed in finding a harmony within your team and have six &AElig;mber at the start of your turn, you'll forge a key and move one step closer to victory. The first to forge three keys wins!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;	\N	2	2	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ZzJ2NGZz4CXxr1VIRkQZtA__original/img/ePqFX4yps1Mj2muu8YKnJE6wmmg=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4298867.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ZzJ2NGZz4CXxr1VIRkQZtA__thumb/img/ywNMVg_jcW9XNWvn80xOB_nT7Eo=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4298867.jpg

1057	37904	Formula D	Formula D is a high stakes Formula One type racing game where the players race simulated cars with the hope of crossing the finish line first.  This is a re-release of Formula D&#195;&#169; with several changes from the original format. Whilst old tracks can be used with the updated Formula D rules, the new game features boards that have an F1 track and a Street Track on the other side. These street tracks each have a novel inclusion or two to add greater theme -&#10;&#10;The game mechanisms are a simple race, get to the finish line first!  However, players have to use a significant amount of planning, and rely on quite a bit of luck.  Each player manages when to shift gears, with each gear providing a different speed.  (For example, 4th gear is a die that rolls random numbers from 7 to 12 for spaces moved.)  Each turn, players may move up one gear, stay in that gear, or move down gears.  This forces players to match possible rolls with the optimum distance for that turn, and hopefully plan ahead.  However, speed is not the only issue!  Corners have a &quot;stop&quot; rule that requires players to stop once, twice, or three times on that corner in consecutive turns or face a penalty.  This creates an effective speed limit to the corners. &#10; Of course, things do not always go as planned!  Players take penalties if they miss their roll, bump into another car, are blocked by other cars, have to brake heavily, or have to downshift several gears.  These are taken off of a car&rsquo;s attributes (Tire health, Brake wear, Transmission Gears, Body, engine, and Suspension).  Losing the maximum in any of these categories will result in elimination, or a severe setback for that car.  This requires that players manage their car&rsquo;s health, plan for their best path, and have good luck on their rolls.  This high amount of luck gives the game its family appeal, and lets weaker players have a chance at winning once in a while.&#10;&#10;However, the fun does not end with a single race!  The rules include the ability to customize your cars, use a pre-generated character, add Slipstreaming (Drafting) rules and road debris, and change tire types to modify your distance rolls.  There are also variations for a single lap race, or multiple laps with pit stops to repair some of your damage points.  In addition, numerous expansion tracks can be purchased to vary the demands on each driver and car.  Each track may also have weather effects (rain) that change car handling and die rolls due to skidding on wet track.  This opens up the game for rally rules giving championship points over a number of races.&#10;&#10;Formula D adds a few items that are not in the original Formula De:  There is the added excitement of illegal racing in the streets of big cities - anything goes!  This adds custom cars, nitro acceleration, drifting in the curves, dirty tricks, gun battles, and trash on the road to add more variation.  A basic change is the use of a &quot;Dashboard&quot; with movable pegs to manage your car&rsquo;s attributes instead of the paper forms from Formula De.  There are also two sets of pre-painted cars; a Formula 1 set and the Street Race set of stock cars.  The street cars come with &quot;Character&quot; profiles to give a bit of role-playing to the game.  Finally, the old category of &quot;Fuel&quot; for the car has been renamed Transmission Wear to give a better thematic fit to the effect of multiple downshifting.&#10;&#10;The popularity of this game has given it a lot of expansions, some simplifications to the rules (See Formula D&#195;&#169; Mini), and a lot of &quot;after market&quot; parts.  There are also fan expansions and tracks for the very dedicated player.  In many ways, this has become a multiple game system.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	10	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ScuaQBHRYnsqrwSxSdEdIw__original/img/xqbaVS5XaicATFoKXZn12X1-k_8=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic519914.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ScuaQBHRYnsqrwSxSdEdIw__thumb/img/F7CaSsa_MWIbHGCoeZ98apbmFQM=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic519914.jpg
1058	46	Medici	Another Reiner Knizia standby, this game plays very well with varying numbers of people.  The object is to accrue the most points during three rounds, which you do by spending your points to bid on sets of cards.  Each turn the current player turns up one to three cards for all the players to bid on, with the highest bid taking all cards.  The cards denote a commodity type and quantity/value.  The round ends when each player's ships are full, or the commodity card deck is exhausted.  After each round, points are awarded to each player having the most of a given commodity, and to the one with the most valuable total &quot;cargo load&quot;.&#10;&#10;Part of the Knizia auction trilogy.&#10;One of the Knizia Florentine auction games.&#10;&#10; Related Games: &#10;&#10;&#10;     Medici vs Strozzi (two-player version)&#10;     Strozzi&#10;     Mercator, included in Neue Spiele im alten Rom (ancestor to Medici).&#10;&#10;&#10;	\N	2	6	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/iif2Nv17Vhw8puN2bATaaw__original/img/imp-iw4Sq2_rv7pEWbGRIpcmVTw=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic7794273.png	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/iif2Nv17Vhw8puN2bATaaw__thumb/img/GtXKwk8tJkmHtUvWPT2FIabXh0w=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7794273.png
1059	1353	Time's Up!	Time's Up! is a charades-based party game for teams of two or more players (and is best with teams of two). Before the game begins, each player looks at several cards featuring famous historical or fictional characters and chooses some of them. Each player's cards are shuffled to form a deck, and this deck of famous names is used for each of the game's three rounds.&#10;&#10;In each round, team members take turns trying to get their teammates to guess as many names as possible in 30 seconds. In round 1, almost any kind of clue is allowed, and the cluegiver cannot pass on a card. In round 2, no more than one word can be used in each clue (but unlimited sounds and gestures are permitted); the cluegiver can pass on any card he likes, and the teammates can give only a single answer. In round 3, the cluegiver can use no words at all and can pass as often as he likes; again, teammates are allowed only a single guess. Give good physical clues in round 1, and they'll pay dividends down the road when you need to keep your mouth shut and gesture like a maniac before time's up!&#10;&#10;Time's Up! is based on the public domain game known as Celebrities.  Also known as Salad Bowl or Fish Bowl.&#10;&#10;	\N	4	18	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/eXgj9wE-fRfd4ZfW6PcjIw__original/img/0MM3j-vUQmrabkHVSC0m49cH4TQ=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3690440.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/eXgj9wE-fRfd4ZfW6PcjIw__thumb/img/-eVeJ2xAfaLeEtO5EutEIi1Ce5M=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3690440.jpg
1060	24508	Taluva	In Taluva, players attempt to successfully settle a South Sea island slowly emerging from the ocean waters as volcano after volcano erupts.&#10;&#10;Each turn, players decide to either have a new volcano erupt along the shore, increasing the size of the island, or to have an existing volcano erupt again, increasing the height of the land around it (and possibly destroying parts of existing settlements). They do this by placing a new tile, consisting of one volcano and two other types of landscape. A tile must always touch at least one other tile, when placed at sea level, or be placed on top of at least two other tiles (without any gaps under the land being created), with the volcano being placed on top of an existing volcano.&#10;Next, the player will place one or more wooden buildings; huts, temples or towers. Settlements must always start at the lowest level, by placing a single hut. From there on, existing settlements may expand by placing huts on all hexes of a single type of terrain around the settlement, with temples once the settlement takes up at least three hexes, or with towers, placed at level three or above.&#10;&#10;The game ends when all tiles have been placed. At that point, the player who's placed most temples wins. Ties are broken by towers, then huts. Ultimate victory - and an immediate end to the game - waits for the player who manages to place all their buildings of two types. Immediate defeat is also possible, when no buildings can legally be played during a player's turn.&#10;&#10;A lot of strategy results from the various placement rules. Volcanoes may never fully destroy a settlement, so single huts can block volcano placement, protecting other settlements. Alternatively, a well placed volcano can split a large settlement in two, creating the opportunity for both to expand more rapidly than a new settlement would. Limiting your opponent's growth potential is at least as important as preparing the terrain for you to expand upon...&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/bkRKeMDARVQnz0cW5l6f5Q__original/img/DpXcbWpHJLvH7ug7NruCdVlkS20=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic6973752.png	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/bkRKeMDARVQnz0cW5l6f5Q__thumb/img/L8SqTfrAi4H6NI-L4Sjfj_JWsw0=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6973752.png

Your choices determine whether Europe is elevated into the bright modern era or remains festering in dark feudalism.&#10;&#10;In Pax Renaissance, you have two actions each turn. As in other Pax games, you can acquire cards in a market, sell them out of the game, or play them into your tableau.

1063	304051	Creature Comforts	Life in the forest is a lot of fun, at least while the sun is shining and the leaves are on the trees. Those days don&rsquo;t last forever though, and long before the weather starts to change, the wise animals start to harvest for the long cold winter ahead. You will spend many months tucked into your burrow and you want to make it as cozy as possible. A nice bowl of soup, a comfortable rocking chair, and some toys and games will go a long way to make those dark winter days pass by quickly.&#10;&#10;In Creature Comforts, you spend the Spring, Summer, and Fall gathering different goods from the forest and spending them to collect items that will make your home more inviting while the world outside is covered in a layer of snow.

1064	13004	The Downfall of Pompeii	The year is AD 79. Pompeii, sitting at the foot of Vesuvius, is at the high point in its development. People come to the city from far and wide to try to make their luck in the city. So far nobody has dreamed of the danger that will bury all of their dreams under mountains of ash just ten years later. Who will survive the eruption of Vesuvius unscathed?&#10;&#10;The simple rules make it easy to get started with The Downfall of Pompeii, a game in which a lot of tactical know-how is required &ndash; along with a little luck &ndash; in order to bring your pieces out of the city at the right time.&#10;&#10;The game falls into two halves: before and after the eruption of Vesuvius. Before the eruption, players play cards to place their pieces in buildings. After the first eruption, they can also place as many relatives as the number of pieces already in the building they placed their piece in. When Omen cards are drawn, the player can take any opponent's piece and throw it into the erupting volcano. In this manner, players try to get as many pieces onto the board as close to the exits from the city as possible.&#10;&#10;After the second eruption, the game changes. Now each player places a lava tile, which kills any pieces on that square and may block exits from the city. Then they move two pieces toward the exits, moving them a number of squares equal to the pieces on the square from which they started. The player who gets the most pieces out of the city wins.&#10;&#10;&bull;&bull;&bull;&#10;&#10;The 2013 second edition of The Downfall of Pompeii includes three dual vent tiles and a new &quot;Dual Vent&quot; variant.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/eZjGZ9O4hdUnc47rDgAgRg__original/img/dH4prpq1jPIi9IS_7a44MlBm6J4=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1685805.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/eZjGZ9O4hdUnc47rDgAgRg__thumb/img/Ii0rodwBgEzpHofswh32VECo1xk=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1685805.jpg

In order to evade the surveillance of the guards who eyed their arrival suspiciously, all four will pull off their heists simultaneously, then dash to the exit. That's the plan anyway&hellip;but can they pull it off?&#10;&#10;Magic Maze is a real-time, cooperative game. Each player can control any hero in order to make that hero perform a very specific action, to which the other players do not have access: Move north, explore a new area, ride an escalator&hellip; All this requires rigorous cooperation between the players in order to succeed at moving the heroes prudently. However, you are allowed to communicate only for short periods during the game; the rest of the time, you must play without giving any visual or audio cues to each other. If all of the heroes succeed in leaving the shopping mall in the limited time allotted for the game, each having stolen a very specific item, then everyone wins together.&#10;&#10;At the start of the game, you have only three minutes in which to take actions. Hourglass spaces you encounter along the way give you more time. If the sand timer ever completely runs out, all players lose the game: Your loitering has aroused suspicion, and the mall security guards nab you!&#10;&#10;	\N	1	8	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/wJfDIveg2zpTGn8E1WzEpA__original/img/hlp96WuBfwiCijcfPddNmfgTq6E=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3268473.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/wJfDIveg2zpTGn8E1WzEpA__thumb/img/Un57jB38oeBZ0WFdd7rXSOEP-1k=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3268473.jpg
1067	119432	Snowdonia	The peaks of Snowdonia rise before you, encased in mist, their summits barely visible. The highest is Snowdon (Wyddfa) herself at 1,085 metres. The year is 1894, and the Snowdon Mountain Tramroad and Hotels Company Limited has been formed to build a branch line from Llanberis to the summit. You can scarcely believe it's possible!&#10;&#10;In Snowdonia players represent work gangs providing labour for the construction of the Snowdon Mountain Railway. Unlike other train games you will have to excavate your way up a mountain side, as well as make and lay the track, construct viaducts and stations. All this in competition with the weather of the Welsh mountains (and the game itself)!&#10;&#10;You may be assisted by a train (though that's not always best) and you'll be able to collect essential materials from the Stock Yard. You will obtain special work contracts that give you bonuses.&#10;&#10;Can you contribute more than the other players to the magnificence of the Snowdon Mountain Railway?&#10;&#10;	\N	1	5	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/04SK6RPEqcArT_g8wHH2TA__original/img/NoGoAZPF6DQ_GQoBEXD7rnI2Lvk=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1430858.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/04SK6RPEqcArT_g8wHH2TA__thumb/img/9Ih7C267B9XzDU_z5tFHTF94Dh0=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1430858.jpg

1069	271518	Disney Villainous: Wicked to the Core	In Villainous: Wicked to the Core, each player takes control of one of three Disney characters, each one a villain in a different Disney movie, specifically the Evil Queen from Snow White, Hades from Hercules, and Dr. Facilier from The Princess and the Frog. Each player has their own villain deck, fate deck, player board, and 3D character.&#10;&#10;On a turn, the active player moves their character to a different location on their player board, takes one or more of the actions visible on that space (often by playing cards from their hand), then refills their hand to four cards. Cards are allies, items, effects, and conditions. You need to use your cards to fulfill your unique win condition.&#10;&#10;One of the actions allows you to choose another player, draw two cards from that player's fate deck, then play one of them on that player's board, covering two of the four action spaces on one of that player's locations. The fate deck contains heroes, items, and effects from that villain's movie, and these cards allow other players to mess with that particular villain.&#10;&#10;Villainous: Wicked to the Core is playable on its own, and its characters can also face off against those in the Villainous base game from 2018.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	3	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/StWdDnw-pdafavsxZHEc-Q__original/img/HEeGUzR0LEU4ve3TfxIn29dtiNA=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4559890.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/StWdDnw-pdafavsxZHEc-Q__thumb/img/aUnAHcKDK6aQ3o0pxjZ1PnNk1jY=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4559890.jpg
1070	121408	Trains	In the 19th century, shortly after the industrial revolution, railways quickly spread over the world. Japan, importing Western culture and eager to become one of the Grand Nations, saw the birth of many private railway companies and entered the Golden Age of railways. Eventually, as a result of the actions of powerful people and capitalists, many of these smaller companies gradually merged into larger ones.&#10;&#10;In Trains, the players are such capitalists, managing private railways companies and striving to become bigger and better than the competition. The game takes place during the 19th and 20th century in the 2012 OKAZU Brand edition, whereas the 2013 AEG/Pegasus edition is set in modern times, with bullet trains, freight trains and more. You will start with a small set of cards, but by building a more effective deck throughout the game, you will be able to place stations and lay rails over the maps of Osaka, Tokyo or other locations. The trick is to purchase the cards you want to use, then use them as effectively as possible. Gain enough points from your railways and you will ultimately manage the most powerful railroads in modern Japan!&#10;&#10;Trains is the first title in AEG's Destination Fun series!

And like many kids, you want to grow your circle of friends, collect pizza and toys, and build the coolest fort.&#10;&#10;By doing this cool stuff, you'll score victory points, and at the end of the game, the player with the most victory points wins! Your cards not only let you take actions on your own turn, but also let you follow the other players' actions on their turns. Will you devote yourself to your own posse, or copy what the other kids are doing?&#10;&#10;But be careful as your carefully constructed deck might start losing cards if you don't actually use them.

1072	1513	The Republic of Rome	The Republic of Rome is an abstraction of over 250 years of history.  It simulates the politics of the Roman Senate during the republic.  The players take the part of various factions vying for the control of the senate.  They control the various powerful families of the time, who compete for state offices, military command, economic concessions and new adherents.  To win the player must get their faction to become the most powerful in Rome.  While doing this, however, a balance must be maintained.  A hostile world situation, and the vagaries of the public of Rome means that the players must also cooperate so that Rome herself doesn't go down under this pressure.  If Rome does not last, neither does the senate, and all players lose!&#10;&#10;Players make proposals to the Senate which other players then vote on. A player's ability to make proposals is determined by which Offices his/her Senators hold. A player's influence in votes is determined by the number of Senators they have recruited and the level of influence those Senators have obtained. Proposals may include assigning Senators to govern provinces (generating revenue), recruiting an army to fight an external foe, addressing the concerns of the Roman people, assigning offices or prosecuting previous office holders. Players have to co-operate to overcome the various threats that the game sends against Rome (wars, famine, unrest, bankruptcy) whilst working to build their own Senators' and Generals' positions and undermine that of their opponents. A powerful General or an influential Senator may become Emperor (thus winning the game) but equally may suddenly fall to the plague or an assassin's blade.&#10;&#10;	\N	1	6	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/1hw9kRfQg849_J5mjPHuBQ__original/img/2neiZgMUdbeliPtHUp-lSCfAOt0=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic487045.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/1hw9kRfQg849_J5mjPHuBQ__thumb/img/A8YR8VBRNcV8QfA46JgyHAw1T6g=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic487045.jpg
1073	171499	Cacao	Cacao is a tile-placement game that immerses players in the exotic world of the &quot;fruit of the Gods&quot;. As the chief of your tribe, you must lead your people to prosperity through the cultivation and trade of cacao &mdash; and to do that, you'll need to put them to work in the best way possible.&#10;&#10;In the game, each player has an individual deck of square worker tiles, with the number of workers on each side of the tile varying from tile to tile. The playing area starts with only a couple of jungle tiles in play: a cacao field and a small market; two jungle tiles are laid face up, and the remaining jungle tiles stacked as a draw pile.&#10;&#10;On a player's turn, he places one of her worker tiles on the board adjacent to one or more jungle tiles already in play, then (if two worker tiles are next to an empty space) adds one of the jungle tiles to the playing area in this space. Her workers then get busy and deliver the results of their effort: If you placed workers next to a cacao field, you receive one or two cacao markers per worker; if they're next to a market, you can choose to sell one cacao marker per worker at the listed price; if next to a well, you receive water; if next to a temple, they stand and look good until the end of the game; and so on. He then refills her hand from her personal deck to three worker tiles.&#10;&#10;Once all players have used all of their worker tiles, the game ends. Players score (or lose) points based on their water supply, and each temple rewards whichever players sent the most workers to it. In the end, whoever has collected the most gold wins.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/oPxM0e3HTS0rIc-9H496Pg__original/img/F_WrTBak8Ct7WtS-S-5cEWxSUBQ=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2379288.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/oPxM0e3HTS0rIc-9H496Pg__thumb/img/WCVlv0gzsj8yHAdyLUDKMb_fmBc=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2379288.jpg
1074	3201	Lord of the Rings: The Confrontation	An asymmetrical Stratego-like game themed around The Lord of the Rings. Each player controls a force of 9 unique characters (light vs. dark) whose identities are hidden from their opponent at the beginning of the game. Each player also starts with a hand of 9 unique cards, which are used in resolving combats as the characters move out across the board. The victory conditions of the players are also asymmetrical: the Fellowship player wins by moving Frodo into Mordor (thus destroying the One Ring), while the Evil player wins either by killing Frodo or by moving 3 Evil characters into the Shire.&#10;&#10;Lord of the Rings: The Confrontation has also been the object of an extended edition (see Lord of the Rings: The Confrontation) comprising the original characters and a full set of new characters.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	2	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/_hBlhE0at6aow5G1I8-NMg__original/img/0fKUj-zz4WDe5210VojrpVJDn0Q=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic69357.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/_hBlhE0at6aow5G1I8-NMg__thumb/img/bsfevmaHrJxqdDW-OKfWKy9eUdM=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic69357.jpg
1075	107529	Kingdom Builder	In Kingdom Builder, the players create their own kingdoms by skillfully building their settlements, aiming to earn the most gold at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;Nine different kinds of terrain are on the variable game board, including locations and castles. During his turn, a player plays his terrain card and builds three settlements on three hexes of this kind. If possible, a new settlement must be built next to one of that player&rsquo;s existing settlements. When building next to a location, the player may seize an extra action tile that he may use from his next turn on. These extra actions allow extraordinary actions such as moving your settlements.&#10;&#10;By building next to a castle, the player will earn gold at the end of the game, but the most gold will be earned by meeting the conditions of the three Kingdom Builder cards; these three cards (from a total of ten in the game) specify the conditions that must be met in order to earn the much-desired gold, such as earning gold for your settlements built next to water hexes or having the majority of settlements in a sector of the board.&#10;&#10;Each game, players will use a random set of Kingdom Builder cards (3 of 10), special actions (4 of 8), and terrain sectors to build the map (4 of 8), ensuring you won't play the same game twice!&#10;&#10;Kingdom Builder FAQ - please read before posting questions in the forum.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/kJOP_BICVX-88sKqFRh9PQ__original/img/2m6YJhA3JbYe1cNhybRtFJrRECw=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1152359.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/kJOP_BICVX-88sKqFRh9PQ__thumb/img/KwrWpSRncnCE0cEldldyVQ-0Cdk=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1152359.jpg

1080	237179	Weather Machine	&ldquo;Natural disasters will soon be a thing of the past!&rdquo; proclaimed Professor S&ecirc;ni Lativ, Project Chief of Meteorological Manipulation at Lightning Technologies. Tests of his new invention, the Weather Machine, showed positive results. Visions of quelling floods, subduing cyclones, and ending droughts made him smile.&#10;&#10;In Weather Machine, you are scientists on Prof. Lativ&rsquo;s team, tampering with local weather: adjusting rainfall for farms, maintaining wind and clear skies for ecological energy sources, and tweaking the temperature for resorts and sporting events. The prototype is quite effective so far; however, a pattern has emerged, revealing a worrying side effect: Each use of the Weather Machine also alters the conditions elsewhere on the planet &mdash; a &ldquo;butterfly effect&rdquo;.&#10;&#10;&quot;We must build a new prototype,&rdquo; he announces as the agents shoot him sidelong glances; &ldquo;&hellip;but this time we&rsquo;re going to get it right.&rdquo; The agents silently give a single, crisp nod of confirmation. &ldquo;The government is funding this, and we will succeed.&rdquo; As Prof. Lativ explains the plan, the need to secure suppliers for sufficient bots and chemicals is clear. In addition to the materials, time is of the essence; you must be focused and efficient to have any hope of reining this growing global terror, Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere before conditions are too harsh for Homo sapiens and other species.&#10;&#10;Note: The solo mode is NOT included in the base game's box.

1081	180511	Shakespeare	The theaters of London are abuzz. In one week, her majesty the Queen will attend their new shows and will grant her support to one of the troupes. It's the chance of a lifetime for the young authors who are inflaming the populace with ever more audacious and motley plays. But how do you create a masterpiece in such a short time? Whoever has the answer to this thorny question will probably enter the rolls of history!&#10;&#10;In Shakespeare, players are theater managers who must recruit actors, craftsmen, jewelers and others in order to assemble everything needed for the play's performance at week's end.&#10;&#10;In more detail, the game lasts six days and on each day players recruit one new character &mdash; starting with five at the beginning of the game: four identical ones on their individual player board and one that they've drafted &mdash; and take 1-5 actions with the characters they have. Characters and their actions are:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Actors: Rehearse one or more acts in the three-act play; the more you rehearse, the more benefits you receive during the dress rehearsals on days four and six.&#10;    Costume mistress: Take costume elements to enhance your actors; if they lack a complete costume, they can't participate in the dress rehearsals.&#10;    Set dresser: Build the set. The more elaborate the set you build, the more rewards you receive &mdash; but the set must be symmetrical!&#10;    Handyman: Set them to work on whatever you need. These joes can assemble both costumes and sets, but they're not very good at it.&#10;    Assistant: Increase the power of your craftsmen, i.e., the three roles described above.&#10;    Jeweler: Take a gold costume element or set piece to dazzle the crowd.&#10;    Queen: Earn money by giving her an early peek, or gain an objective to win her favor on the final day.&#10;&#10;&#10;After players take actions, they check the individual ambience level in their theater, gaining or losing points or rehearsal time depending on the atmosphere. Dress rehearsal on the fourth and sixth days provide another chance for fully-dressed actors to perform, and those who are well-rehearsed earn points or money.&#10;&#10;On all but the final days, players must allow characters who performed to rest, with only one of those characters being able to work the next day. Thus, the more you put them to work today, the less you'll be able to do tomorrow &mdash; but those who don't plan to do as much act before other players, so that might be a good thing.&#10;&#10;In the end, players must pay their actors, with each unpaid actor blemishing your reputation and costing you points. Whoever finishes with the most prestige points wins.&#10;&#10;	\N	1	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/37zrXPBAfqnS6CyeKTYiIw__original/img/3SqhNH97ZQDZM19KlXMiuPOPKVw=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2583214.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/37zrXPBAfqnS6CyeKTYiIw__thumb/img/63aUA3o6a1Q5U4pW3NR8aa_5Szo=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2583214.jpg
1082	328866	My Father's Work	The walls were lined with iron shelves, each metal slat overfilled with glass jars containing formaldehyde and grotesque curiosities within. Pristine brass tools and refined metals of a quality I had never before laid eyes upon were strewn across sturdy slabs of rock and wood, their edges sharp with use. However, my eyes were soon drawn to a sturdy writing desk, its mahogany eaves inlaid with thin strips of copper, the center of which contained a well-worn leather-bound book. My father's journal &mdash; passed down to me and representing years of knowledge and countless experiments. And inside that weathered tome, atop the pearly parchment oxidized yellow at its frayed edges, were the deliberate quill marks of a crazed genius outlining the ambitious project he could never complete in one lifetime &mdash; his masterwork.&#10;&#10;Without realizing it, my hands were shaking as I clutched the book to my chest. At once, I felt an ownership and anxiety for the scientific sketches scrawled so eloquently on those frayed sheets. It was at that moment that I began my obsession: I would restore this laboratory to its former brilliance and dedicate my life to completing my father's work!&#10;&#10;In My Father's Work, players are competing mad scientists entrusted with a page from their father's journal and a large estate in which to perform their devious experiments. Players earn points by completing experiments, aiding the town in its endeavors, upgrading their macabre estates, and hopefully completing their father's masterwork.&#10;&#10;But they have to balance study and active experimentation because at the end of each generation, all of their experiments and resources are lost to time until their child begins again with only the &quot;Journaled Knowledge and Estate&quot; they have willed to them &mdash; and since the game is played over the course of three generations, it is inevitable that the players will rouse the townsfolk to form angry mobs or spiral into insanity from the ethically dubious works they have created. The player with the most points at the end of three generations wins and becomes the most revered, feared, ingenious scientist the world has ever known!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/N0hCcxXw8d7vUjKfsYO6vg__original/img/P8-tSkeRO-e3SnNXh4Yq8d0JcWQ=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic6121929.png	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/N0hCcxXw8d7vUjKfsYO6vg__thumb/img/K4DDlRzl6qlQf9L_oMLb7g9WUYo=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6121929.png
1089	58281	Summoner Wars	&#10;&#10;&#10;    &#10;        GAME SYSTEM&#10;&#10;    &#10;    &#10;         This entry is to allow for discussion/rating of the game system as a whole. It is not for a specific product or release. Versions will appear on the individual item pages.&#10;&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;Summoner Wars is a fast-playing, action-packed 2-4 player card game.  Players take on the role of Summoners: powerful beings who harness the power of mysterious Summoning Stones to lead their race to conquest on the war-torn planet of Itharia.  These Summoners wield terrible magic on the battlefield, freezing their foes in place, draining their enemies of power, and even bringing rains of fire down from the heavens.   But most notoriously, they summon their great race&rsquo;s hordes of warriors to the battlefield, to clash in the never-ending struggle for supremacy.  A Summoner is both mage and general, and must combine their wizardly might with clever tactics to defeat the enemy Summoner on the opposite side of the battle.&#10;&#10;Each Starter Set of Summoner Wars contains 2 complete, battle-ready Factions, ready to jump you and an opponent into the thick of the War for Itharia.  Each Faction is a unique race or civilization with its own secret goals, be it wild-eyed Elves bent on revenge, or blood-crazed Goblins who merely want to set the world ablaze.  Starter Sets also include everything you will need to play, including a Battle Mat, Wound counters, dice, and a rulebook.&#10;&#10;But the war doesn&rsquo;t end there!  Summoner Wars is fully expandable with entirely new faction decks such as the hideous Undead of the Fallen Kingdom, or the righteous and knightly Human Vanguards.  In addition, each Faction will have its own expansions, adding new warriors, summoners, and abilities to allow for a never-ending mix of combat options and surprises.  Expansions will also include Mercenary units - warriors who care nothing for politics and will fight for any side that can afford them!&#10;&#10;Summoner Wars uses a simple but deep rules set to capture both the strategy of deck construction and card playing, with the tactics of miniature war games.  By purchasing expansions or multiple Starter Sets, players can customize their Faction Decks to suit any style of play and to keep their opponents guessing.  During the game, players summon and move their various warriors about the battlefield using their unique powers and abilities to wreak havoc on the enemy lines.  In the course of a game each side will inflict terrible casualties upon the other in their brutal quest for victory.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/EWi-utp09EIJnwia_o_Taw__original/img/qF_KgqLXIoXy41sGezN3ie34_Io=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic5152378.png	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/EWi-utp09EIJnwia_o_Taw__thumb/img/vEFkO1QccS2LQpL7fgX7-v1hZhg=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5152378.png
1083	21763	Mr. Jack	In Mr. Jack, one of the two players represents Jack the Ripper, who will be one of the eight characters on the board. This player knows which character is Mr. Jack, and his goal is to flee from the district as soon as possible (or avoid being accused for eight turns). The other player represents an independent investigator (not represented on the board) who tries to guess the identity of Jack &mdash; but he can make only one accusation during the game!&#10;&#10;During each turn, the players move the characters, using their special powers and placing them either in shadow or light.  At the end of each turn, the witnesses declare whether Jack is visible &mdash; that is, in light or adjacent to another character &mdash; or not (alone in the shadows). This allows the investigator to know which characters are innocent. As the turns progress, the investigator tries to eliminate suspects while Jack tries to escape. Intuition, logic, and cold blood will be necessary for each of the two participants.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	2	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/CDdF4xOQJsNK0gX8-tBdCQ__original/img/d18QDvd0PyfMsipVpHPajZCFPsE=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3066125.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/CDdF4xOQJsNK0gX8-tBdCQ__thumb/img/5b44BrekfAQznAhRIOSPDtwHMsg=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3066125.jpg

Players take turns being the Question Master, whose role is to set a category, write a word within that category on dry erase cards, and hand those out to other players as artists. At the same time, one player will have only an &quot;X&quot; written on his card: they are the fake artist!&#10;&#10;Players will then go around the table twice, drawing one contiguous stroke each on a paper to draw the word established by the Question Master, then guess who the fake artist is. If the fake artist is not caught, both the fake artist and the Question Master earn points; if the fake artist is caught and cannot guess what the word is, the artists earn points.&#10;&#10;	\N	5	10	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/5Q5YHxJeVp6PAhfv5Ct0-g__original/img/yRNioltDOtjrTRXa0HHoTTCWNf8=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic3678404.png	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/5Q5YHxJeVp6PAhfv5Ct0-g__thumb/img/nqo8xhGEWnqXYDEvYcVpBpABBI4=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3678404.png
1086	218074	Detective: City of Angels	Detective: City of Angels, set in the dark and violent world of 1940s Los Angeles, is a game of mystery, deception, and investigation for 1&ndash;5 players. Most players will step into the shoes of LAPD homicide detectives, hungry for glory and willing to do whatever it takes to successfully close a case, even if that means intimidating suspects, concealing evidence, and hiring snitches to rat on their fellow detectives. One player, however, will take on the role of The Chisel, whose only goal is to stall and misdirect the detectives at every turn using bluffing, manipulation, and (often) outright lies.&#10;&#10;Detective: CoA uses the innovative ARC (Adaptive Response Card) System to create the feel of interrogating a suspect. Suspects do not simply give paragraph-book responses; instead The Chisel carefully chooses how they will answer. When Billy O'Shea insists that the victim was a regular at Topsy's Nightclub, is he telling the truth or is The Chisel subtly leading the detectives toward a dead end that will cost them precious time? Detectives can challenge responses that they think are lies but at great risk: If they're wrong, The Chisel will acquire leverage over them, making the case that much harder to solve.&#10;&#10;Detective: CoA includes separate, detailed casebooks for both the detectives and The Chisel. Each crime is a carefully constructed puzzle that can unfold in a variety of ways depending on how the detectives choose to pursue their investigations. As the detectives turn the city upside down, uncovering fresh evidence and &quot;hot&quot; leads, hidden suspects may be revealed and new lines of questioning will open up, creating a rich, story-driven experience.&#10;&#10;Inspired by classic film noir like The Big Sleep, the works of James Ellroy (L.A. Confidential), and the video game L.A. Noire from Rockstar Games, Detective: City of Angels is a murder-mystery game unlike any other. Will one detective rise above the rest and close the case on L.A.'s latest high profile murder? Or will The Chisel sow enough doubt and confusion to prevent the detectives from solving the crime?&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;A &quot;sleuth&quot; mode allows 1 or more players to play fully cooperatively, solving the cases together.&#10;&#10;	\N	1	5	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/xWdK1lL-2ZTdzBZGYjjqkw__original/img/952nbRCH-EE0TtcMD_Cpol0tRXQ=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3469246.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/xWdK1lL-2ZTdzBZGYjjqkw__thumb/img/wl_YxOhd-S6QbpyHAQZGhV109rw=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3469246.jpg
1087	348450	Lacrimosa	Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart is dead. His last conscious action on his deathbed was composing the Lacrimosa movement of his Opus Requiem. You, as one of his sponsors, will meet with the widow in order to participate one last time in the funding of the works of the Austrian genius. Also, you will reminisce and retell all your memories alongside Mozart in order to make sure that she portrays you under the best light when writing her memoirs in order to enter history as Mozart's most important patron.&#10;&#10;In Lacrimosa, players take the roles of patrons of the late musician, contributing with their fundings to the composer's works one last time. During the game, you play in two different timelines: the present and the past. In the present, you commission the missing parts of the Requiem from other composers in order to complete it. When developing past events, the game takes place in five epochs in which you contribute by buying new compositions from the composer to sell or exhibit, accompany him on the different journeys through the main courts and theaters in Europe, and gather the resources you need in order to support the musician during his career.&#10;&#10;During the game, you play cards from a limited hand that you will improve as the game progresses. These cards can be played either as actions or as resource generators, and players need to optimize their resources and finances in order to support their best version of the story and their relationship with Mozart.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;	\N	1	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/0aS85HPSKKGHGVvWQEEZew__original/img/Ww2bs-arDFMqVhte3VOtmGlq_SQ=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic6795274.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/0aS85HPSKKGHGVvWQEEZew__thumb/img/Vxx4SHednYKXpDMP6eHTK9DqmSc=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6795274.jpg
1090	100423	Elder Sign	Game description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;It is 1926, and the museum's extensive collection of exotic curios and occult artifacts poses a threat to the barriers between our world and the elder evils lurking between dimensions. Gates to the beyond begin to leak open, and terrifying creatures of increasing strength steal through them. Animals, the mad, and those of more susceptible minds are driven to desperation by the supernatural forces the portals unleash. Only a handful of investigators race against time to locate the eldritch symbols necessary to seal the portals forever. Only they can stop the Ancient One beyond from finding its way to Earth and reducing humanity to cinders.&#10;&#10;Elder Sign is a fast-paced, cooperative dice game of supernatural intrigue for one to eight players by Richard Launius and Kevin Wilson, the designers of Arkham Horror. Players take the roles of investigators racing against time to stave off the imminent return of the Ancient One. Armed with tools, allies, and occult knowledge, investigators must put their sanity and stamina to the test as they adventure to locate Elder Signs, the eldritch symbols used to seal away the Ancient Ones and win the game.&#10;&#10;To locate Elder Signs, investigators must successfully endure Adventures within the museum and its environs. A countdown mechanism makes an Ancient One appear if the investigators are not quick enough. The investigators must then battle the Ancient One. A clever and thematic dice mechanism pits their exploration against monsters and the sheer difficulty of staying sane and healthy, all within the standard game duration of one to two hours.&#10;&#10;	\N	1	8	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/wNCSCl961fMzDUhwetfjTg__original/img/H-iLs6JcceMk96bYON5c9PFUag8=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1236119.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/wNCSCl961fMzDUhwetfjTg__thumb/img/sc0S7TSpC40Mg9EEmufj-XqXcBw=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1236119.jpg

1093	2398	Cribbage	Cribbage is a card game invented in the early 17th century, based on the earlier game Noddy. It is played with a deck of standard playing cards and a signature piece of equipment called the cribbage board.  Cribbage is traditionally played as a 2 player game.&#10;&#10;In the version usually played today, each player is dealt a hand of 6 cards, from which they discard 2 into a special pile called the Crib.  One card is then cut from the draw pile and turned face up - it is considered part of each player's hand and of the Crib.  The players then play cards in turn, scoring points for hitting certain totals, or for making sets or sequences.  Score is kept by moving pegs along tracks on the cribbage board.  This is repeated until both players have exhausted their hand of cards.&#10;&#10;Next, each player picks up their hand and determines all possible scoring combinations, pegging points again on the cribbage board.  The dealer then picks up the Crib and scores it for all possible points.  Then the cards are shuffled and the deal alternates.  The winner is the first to reach 121 points.&#10;&#10;The origin date listed for this game is approximate.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	6	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/EHTu2qG_Nr52NrNMzv_bXw__original/img/xLP9Vul05Qx1wEK1meMKnJvwlqc=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic121093.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/EHTu2qG_Nr52NrNMzv_bXw__thumb/img/tjDba3XVIJFy1OiwX_TFMulO5To=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic121093.jpg
1094	300300	Chronicles of Crime: 1400	&quot;You are Abelard Lavel, a knight sworn to King Charles VI the Beloved. You live in the city of Paris in a family mansion not far from the famous Notre Dame cathedral. Since you were a child, you had strange, prophetic dreams in which you saw violent scenes of past crimes or even ones yet to be committed. Over time you learned that your unusual gift could be put to good use and you started to solve cases that nobody else could crack. This earned you some reputation in the city and now people seek your help whenever a mysterious crime is committed.&quot;&#10;&#10;The Chronicles of Crime: 1400 standalone game brings back well-known mechanisms of the original Chronicles of Crime game while adding some new twists. Now you can deduce not only from the evidence you find or the testimonies given by various characters but also from the mysterious scenes depicted on new Vision Cards. These scenes can be either from the future or from the past and they usually involve characters and objects yet to be revealed.&#10;&#10;During your investigation, you can also count on your family members to share their knowledge with you. You can ask your uncle, a monk who has a wealth of knowledge about written texts, your sister a merchant who knows something about almost any object you&rsquo;ll find or even your brother, a king&rsquo;s spy, who knows a story or two about many of the people you will meet. Finally, your faithful dog is always willing to trace a suspect for you, just bring him an item belonging to the person in question and he&rsquo;ll track them down!&#10;&#10;Part of Chronicles of Crime - The Millennium Series&#10;Chronicles of Crime is back with a range of games called &quot;The Millennium Series&quot;. Three brand new standalone Chronicles of Crime games, working with the same great system but providing interesting gameplay twists and refreshing universes that span an entire millennium from 1400 to 1900 and finally 2400.

1102	113294	Escape: The Curse of the Temple	Escape: The Curse of the Temple is a cooperative game in which players must escape (yes...) from a temple (yes...) which is cursed (yes...) before the temple collapses and kills one or more explorers, thereby causing everyone to lose.&#10;&#10;The initial game board consists of a row of three square tiles, each showing a combination of two symbols, say, two green adventurers or one green adventurer and one blue key in one corner of the tile. All of the explorers start in the center tile &ndash; the safe room &ndash; and each player starts with a hand of five dice. Each die has five symbols:&#10;&#10;&#10;    A cursed mask &ndash; this die is set aside when rolled.&#10;    A golden mask &ndash; each such symbol counteracts two cursed masks, either your own or those of another explorer in the same room.&#10;    A red torch or blue key &ndash; these are used to enter rooms, access treasure, or activate gems.&#10;    A green adventurer, which appears twice on the die &ndash; you need these to move from room to room, and to activate some gems.&#10;&#10;&#10;Escape is played in real-time, with all players rolling dice and taking actions simultaneously. You must roll the right symbols to enter a room, and if you're at an open doorway, you can roll to reveal the next tile in the stack and add it to that doorway. Some rooms contain combinations of red and blue symbols, and if you (possibly working with other players in the same room) roll enough red or blue symbols, you &quot;discover&quot; magic gems, moving them from a separate gem depot onto that tile.&#10;&#10;The real-time aspect is enforced by a soundtrack to be played during the game. At certain points, a countdown starts, and if players aren't back in the safe room when time is up, they lose one of their dice.&#10;&#10;Once the exit tile is revealed, players can attempt to escape the temple by moving to that tile, then rolling a number of blue dice equal to the magic gems that haven't been removed from the gem depot. Thus, the more gems you find, the easier it is to escape the temple. When a player escapes, he gives one die to a player of his choice. If all players escape before the third countdown, everyone wins; if not, everyone loses, no matter how many players did escape.&#10;&#10;Escape: The Curse of the Temple includes two expansion modules that can be used individually or together. With the &quot;Treasures&quot; module, some rooms contain treasure, and when you reveal such a room, you place a face-down treasure chest on the tile. Roll the symbols on that chest tile, and you claim the treasure for use later: a key lets you teleport anywhere, a path lets you connect two rooms that otherwise have no door between them, and a medic kit heals all players instantly (putting black dice back into play). With the &quot;Curses&quot; module, some tiles &quot;curse&quot; players by forcing them to place one hand on their head, keep mute during play, or otherwise do what you wouldn't want to do while escaping a temple!&#10;&#10;	\N	1	5	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/m6269wyfWVa7gZp3oXKx6A__original/img/ZSDgydHuIZpyrZaVL1F7Lepi3h0=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3328521.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/m6269wyfWVa7gZp3oXKx6A__thumb/img/WPqYsCIpVURoB_rdqRLgZptWNV8=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3328521.jpg
1095	284760	Disney Villainous: Evil Comes Prepared	In Disney Villainous: Evil Comes Prepared, each player takes control of one of three Disney characters, each one a villain in a different Disney movie, specifically Scar from The Lion King, Yzma from The Emperor's New Groove, and Ratigan from The Great Mouse Detective. Each player has their own villain deck, fate deck, player board, and 3D character.&#10;&#10;On a turn, the active player moves their character to a different location on their player board, takes one or more of the actions visible on that space (often by playing cards from their hand), then refills their hand to four cards. Cards are allies, items, effects, and conditions. You need to use your cards to fulfill your unique win condition.&#10;&#10;One of the actions allows you to choose another player, draw two cards from that player's fate deck, then play one of them on that player's board, covering two of the four action spaces on one of that player's locations. The fate deck contains heroes, items, and effects from that villain's movie, and these cards allow other players to mess with that particular villain.&#10;&#10;Disney Villainous: Evil Comes Prepared is playable on its own, and its characters can also face off against those in the Disney Villainous base game from 2018 and the Disney Villainous: Wicked to the Core standalone game in 2019.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	3	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/iEfri2p4Vqh6QFIxc5IlCg__original/img/it21m6c_rGzW6-K8aGDtbDswGAk=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4849477.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/iEfri2p4Vqh6QFIxc5IlCg__thumb/img/9xcLYtvW_gKIQV1s0XPm7kkclhw=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4849477.jpg

1097	298383	Golem	Golem is an engine-building game by Simone Luciani, Virginio Gigli and Flaminia Brasini, the same team that brought you Grand Austria Hotel and Lorenzo il Magnifico.&#10;&#10;The game is based on the 16th-century legend of the Golem of Prague, an anthropomorphic creature that Rabbi Loew animated from a clay statue to protect his people. In the game, players take on the role of rabbis who create and grow these powerful creatures that will be moved around the neighborhoods of Prague under the control of students. Be careful, because if a golem becomes too powerful, it will destroy everything it encounters on its way. Players can also kill their Golems in order to get bonuses.&#10;&#10;Players also create powerful artifacts and acquire knowledge by collecting ancient books.&#10;&#10;The game is divided into four rounds, and each round is composed of 7 phases:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Refresh&#10;     Golem Movement&#10;     Actions (2 marble actions and 1 rabbi action)&#10;     Turn Order&#10;     Influence Character&#10;     Income and Development&#10;     Golem Control&#10;&#10;&#10;At the beginning of each round, the players will shuffle the colored marbles into the 3D synagogue that will split them into five lines corresponding to the five main actions available in the game:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Work: By paying Knowledge, you can activate the Golem placed in the city of Prague and get bonuses.&#10;     Golem: Obtain clay to create new golems and upgrade the developments on your personal board.&#10;     Artifact: Obtain coins and buy gold to build artifacts that offer permanent bonuses in the game and upgrade developments on your personal board.&#10;     Spells: Obtain Knowledge and perform spells (with a scoring for book collection) and upgrade developments on your personal board.&#10;     Mirror: Perform one action of your choice by paying 1 coin.&#10;&#10;&#10;The number of marbles available in the corresponding action line determines how much the player gets from the action. When you choose an action, you collect one marble of your choice in the corresponding line and depending on the color of the marble you chose, you also move your student forward on one of the districts of Prague.&#10;&#10;It's important to advance your students on those tracks to be able to keep your golems under control. At the end of the round, knowledge can also be used to control a golem that surpassed its students, but if one of these creatures is uncontrolled, it may become dangerous and destroy the neighborhood, after which you will have to destroy and bury it!&#10;&#10;The marble color also matters, because at the end of the round, if you get the correct combination of two colors, you receive the favor of one of the powerful Prague characters, which will differ each round.&#10;&#10;At the end of the fourth round, players score points for active or buried golems, artifacts, books, development on their personal board, and collected goal cards.&#10;&#10;	\N	1	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/9wDd5YVER3lwpGO3v5EkTA__original/img/RtYW5lfwrLzWDI0rorp_vqI9af8=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5374175.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/9wDd5YVER3lwpGO3v5EkTA__thumb/img/81chTLWy3JxqRTktAuE4Nb4LamI=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5374175.jpg
1098	244114	Yellow & Yangtze	The period of the Warring States (475-221 BCE) describes a time of endless wars between seven rival states: Qin, Chu, Qi, Yan, Han, Wei, and Zhao. These states were finally unified in 221 BCE&nbsp;under the Qin dynasty to lay the origin of today's China, with its two main rivers: the Yellow and the Yangtze.&#10;&#10;Yellow &amp; Yangtze, the sister game to the highly acclaimed board game Tigris &amp; Euphrates, invites you to replay this eventful period and to lead your dynasty to victory.&#10;&#10;In Yellow &amp; Yangtze, players build civilizations through tile placement. Players are given five different leaders: Governor, Soldier, Farmer, Trader, and Artisan. The leaders are used to collect victory points in these same categories. However, your score at the end of the game is the number of points in your weakest category. Conflicts arise when civilizations connect on the board. To succeed, players' civilizations must survive these conflicts, calm peasant revolts, and grow secure enough to build prestigious pagodas.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/BxHQLD5nnVltDWXt4OKsgQ__original/img/py1wiNlyhiBknLyhNDd5zsu2zFg=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3938502.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/BxHQLD5nnVltDWXt4OKsgQ__thumb/img/Xf9hEf74SZfcOi0ZbNhdUW6BTt0=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3938502.jpg
1099	88	Torres	Torres is an abstract game of resource management and tactical pawn movement.  Players are attempting to build up castles and position their knights to score the most points each turn.  Players have a limited supply of knights and action cards that allow special actions to be taken.  Efficient use of pieces and cards, along with a thoughtful awareness of future possibilities, is the heart of this game.&#10;&#10;Torres is considered by many to be an informal member of what is referred to as the Mask Trilogy.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/vLDgCpcL-beOsC5iWfZ9ig__original/img/upBZeKEaQHY6LZS7R-hykx6a7kY=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3515154.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/vLDgCpcL-beOsC5iWfZ9ig__thumb/img/TPQCIaZKOl2ApBfBk0HgVjVsovw=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3515154.jpg
1100	306040	Merv: The Heart of the Silk Road	Merv: The Heart of the Silk Road is a tense economic game charting the rise and fall of the greatest city in the world.&#10;&#10;In Merv, players are vying to amass power and wealth in the prosperous heart of the Silk Road. Through careful court intrigue, timely donations to the grand mosque, and favorable trade deals, players attempt to redirect as much of that prosperity as possible into their own pockets.&#10;&#10;Meanwhile, beyond the city walls Mongol hordes approach. If you help construct the city walls, you give up on precious opportunities to build up your own stature, but leave it unprotected and you will burn with the city.

1101	233247	Civilization: A New Dawn	Description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;Sid Meier's Civilization: A New Dawn is a strategy board game in which two to four players act as the rulers of history's most memorable empires. Over the course of the game, players will expand their domains, gain new technologies, and build many of humanity's greatest wonders. In the end, one nation will rise above all others to leave its indelible mark upon history.&#10;&#10;This new game presents players with an undiscovered country to conquer, built from beautifully illustrated map tiles. These would-be conquerors construct and populate the map with barbarians, natural resources, and city-states, then formulate their plans for how they will shape this world to their vision. Their exact goals, however, change with each game. Agendas are detailed on victory cards, three of which are drawn during set up. Players race to become the first to accomplish one agenda on each of these victory cards, spreading throughout the world and ensuring their civilization&rsquo;s place as the greatest world power.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/S0GM2Mxfh8Tmvsdeog0W0g__original/img/VAuHAXQZXWYFXlwbPqbwmmiSv_w=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3764168.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/S0GM2Mxfh8Tmvsdeog0W0g__thumb/img/FmFQ2XURW1ndAFqlvnUYV7cxCAA=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3764168.jpg
1103	193558	The Oracle of Delphi	Description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;&quot;For once, Zeus, Greek god of thunder and sky, is in high spirits. Hence, he decides to offer a generous gift to a worthy mortal and invite him, or her, to his realm, to Olympus. To determine a sufficient candidate, Zeus hosts a competition for his entertainment. Twelve legendary tasks are imposed upon the fearless participants: to erect graceful statues, to raise awe-inspiring sanctuaries, to offer capacious offerings, and to slay the most fearsome monsters. The first participant to master all the posed assignments wins the favor of the father of the gods himself.&#10;&#10;Indubitably, you will not pass up this golden opportunity, so you clear your ship and rally your crew to follow on the trails of legendary Odysseus through the dangerous waters of the Aegean. But how could you find the righteous path onward? There is but one who can help you. Visit the mysterious oracle of Delphi and let her answers guide your ways.&#10;&#10;In Stefan Feld's new game The Oracle of Delphi, the player's ships travel across a large variable game board of hexagonal tiles showing islands and the surrounding waters. Each player aims to reach certain islands to perform the twelve tasks given by Zeus: e.g., to collect offerings of different colors and to deliver them to corresponding temples, or to slay monsters of a specific type (and color), all of which can be discovered on the islands.&#10;&#10;In order to execute these color-dependent actions, you are given three colored dice each turn, the so-called &quot;oracle dice&quot;. Rolling the dice (at the start of the turn) is equivalent to consulting the oracle, whereas the results represent her answers. The answers determine which actions you will be able to take, but you will always have three actions per turn. However, a slight divergence from your fate is often possible.&#10;&#10;In addition to the oracle, you can request support from the gods and you can acquire favor tokens, companions, and other special abilities that will help you win the race against other competitors.&#10;&#10;Differently equipped ships and the variable set-up of the game board will offer new challenging and interesting strategic and tactical decisions with every new game of The Oracle of Delphi that you play.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/tZFlvhcA97SjyNGurpU6Ag__original/img/BdmVT0x8dOy65F2IFSYYTyLSqfU=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3574541.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/tZFlvhcA97SjyNGurpU6Ag__thumb/img/fMd29Q6_L8VxO4tLCJROZT7p4is=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3574541.jpg
1104	283864	Trails of Tucana	Trails of Tucana is a flip-and-write game from the creators of Avenue and Doodle City that is quick and easy to play, but has enough depth to entertain gamers.&#10;&#10;Each player is given a map of the island Tucana, showing its villages and important sights. The positions of the villages are randomized for each player, so every game will provide a unique puzzle.&#10;&#10;Each turn, one player flips over two terrain cards. Each player must draw &mdash; on their own map &mdash; a trail between two neighboring spaces of the shown terrains. Gradually, the trails will grow into a network of roads. Players score points by connecting matching harbors, and by connecting sights to harbors. Being the first to connect a pair of harbors provides bonus points.&#10;&#10;To add depth to the game, there are varying distribution of the different terrain cards. Mountain cards are for instance rarer than desert cards, so it would be harder to build a trail through a mountain range or over water than through desert or forest. Players need to take this into account when planning their routes. And they should maximize the probability that they will be able to make use of any combination of terrain cards that may come up.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from designer&#10;&#10;AWARDS AND HONORS:&#10;&#10;2021 Finnish Game of the Year (family) WINNER&#10;2020 Norwegian Game of the Year WINNER&#10;2020 Norwegian Game of the Year NOMINEE&#10;2019 The Dice Tower SEAL OF EXCELLENCE&#10;&#10;	\N	1	8	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/y8ifesXfHobUtIgnSuC0DA__original/img/8fe6EzD9co2hkaqFDsxHeoMY5SA=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4860701.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/y8ifesXfHobUtIgnSuC0DA__thumb/img/y5rGQUFTGETcIg9HSfuGnHkD234=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4860701.jpg
1105	283863	The Magnificent	The Magnificent is a tightly designed Eurogame from the creators of Santa Maria set in a mystical world beautifully illustrated by French artist Martin Mottet.&#10;&#10;In the game, players are competing to attract the largest audiences to their shows, featuring magnificent performers. In the process, you must expand your camp by placing Tetris-style tiles on your player board, gather elements needed for the shows, and set up performances in your tents.&#10;&#10;On your turn, you take one die from the supply. The value of the chosen die is your strength. Add to this the value of all dice of the same color that you have already collected, then use this strength to carry out one of three main actions: build, travel or perform. The more strength you have, the better the action will be, but at the end of the round, you must pay &mdash; in coins &mdash; the total of your highest-valued dice color. Thus, taking dice of the same color makes for better actions, but will cost more coins.&#10;&#10;After each player has taken four turns, the round ends. Each player must discard one of their ringmaster cards and score points according to its requirements. After three rounds, the game ends, and the player who has collected the most points wins.&#10;&#10;In more detail, players start the game with four ringmaster cards and a unique trainer tile. Each ringmaster card provides a special ability (which is triggered when you place a die on it) and a unique end-of-round scoring opportunity. When you choose a ringmaster card to discard and score at the end of the round, you must therefore also take into consideration which special abilities you want to keep.&#10;&#10;In addition to your main action, you may use trainers on your personal unique trainer tiles or on common trainer spaces on the game board for various benefits.&#10;&#10;At the end of each round, in order of the players' highest-ranked performances, players choose a new ringmaster card and a trainer tile, providing new abilities and scoring opportunities for the next round.&#10;&#10;	\N	1	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/6pci74DWc7U7XuwkfpEu2Q__original/img/wrPl4ne51gvMUIeUuv56k02CUhE=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4871117.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/6pci74DWc7U7XuwkfpEu2Q__thumb/img/K-X_5jjTMmesaFzFUoFOZu5p_AU=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4871117.jpg

Undaunted, you journey to a strange land to reinvent yourself and reclaim your honor. Will you farm the earth, fight as knights or finagle your own feudums?&#10;&#10;Feudum (latin for fiefdom) is an economic medieval game of hand and resource management for 2-5 players. With many strategies at their disposal, players optimize four actions per turn in attempt to score the most victory points over five epochs.&#10;&#10;Each player controls several medieval characters that roam the countryside tending farms, taxing towns and taking outposts in effort to rise in power.&#10;&#10;But that&rsquo;s only the tip of the behemoth's horn! You will also compete to acquire coveted feudums, which increase your membership status in one of six guilds. But beware! Feudum owners must pay homage to the king through military service or face the charge of disloyalty.&#10;&#10;Once a guild member, you will dutifully play your part in a progressive economic cycle, whereby the farmer ships goods to the merchant who equips the alchemist, who invents black powder, which arms the knight, and so on.&#10;&#10;If you run your guilds wisely, maintain control of key locations and adapt best to changing events, you will be victorious. Unless, of course, you starve, get sidetracked by sea serpents or develop an unhealthy interest in fermented grapes.

1107	73171	Earth Reborn	After 500 years, two factions emerge from their underground cities into a new world, an Earth reborn from nuclear disaster.&#10;&#10;12 highly detailed miniatures represent the two factions:&#10;&#10;NORAD: military in thinking and origins. Scientists and engineers add to their strength.&#10;&#10;SALEMITES: occultists working with cadavers, bringing the dead to life.&#10;&#10;Soon after emerging, these two factions meet - and it is determined that they cannot live together in peace.&#10;&#10;Earth Reborn offers nine scenarios that take you through missions of rescue, retrieval, and escort through areas of labs, mansions, towns, and more. Each scenario builds upon the rules of a new chapter: the game system is built like a tutorial. There are core rules to start the game, and each chapter offers 1-3 new rules along with a scenario that uses these new rules.&#10;&#10;The game also contains the innovative S.A.G.S. (Scenario Auto Generating System), where 2-4 players can make their own maps and mission objectives for near infinite replayability!&#10;&#10;Other features include:&#10;&#10;        A Tetris-like board construction using polyomino floor tiles.&#10;        An order tiles system to give commands to your miniatures.&#10;        Interrupt Duels with Bluff, betting command points to interrupt an enemy character and act during another player's turn.&#10;        The I.P.S. (Iconographic Phrasing System) that allows almost any effect to occur with icons, totally language independent.&#10;        Colored base arcs on miniatures to simplify Line of Sight, shooting, and close combat. It also multiplies characters&rsquo; variations and possibilities.&#10;        The Search rule, giving a visceral feeling to searching in rooms to find equipment.&#10;        A Mission Points track that also serves as a Morale Points track. &#10;        Radio Scrambling to mess with your opponents' orders.&#10;&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/77ccl-nXuwWw3Xj6woR3fA__original/img/ylcnK9Z-LXKCBOlbeWo22H-3c40=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic746581.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/77ccl-nXuwWw3Xj6woR3fA__thumb/img/S4KtdrTXbVvFYLTPvdjDI1z4EX4=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic746581.jpg
1108	70512	Luna	&quot;The end of her regency is nigh. It's time to clear the way for a new bearer of the burden. She will keep a wary eye on the novices representing their Orders and trying to win her favor. Eventually, she will have to come to a decision. Which Order will prove itself worthy to decide on her successor? There will be a new Moon Priestess and she will bear the title: LUNA.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;LUNA&quot; is the title of the Moon Priestess, and before her very eyes, each of the up to four Orders competes for the right to decide on her successor. The players are the heads of the Orders who try to convince the Priestess of themselves. Over the course of six rounds, they need to collect as many influence points as possible by skillfully placing their novices to achieve that goal.&#10;&#10;The players move their novices over seven islands surrounding a temple island. The novices are placed according to the &quot;worker movement&quot; principle, i.e. they aren't placed at the beginning of a round, but instead start where they ended the round before. Thus, novice movement is an important part of a round: Only if you're in the right place at the right time, you'll gain the deciding influence points. You'll have to build new shrines, work at the temple, and participate in the Priestess' divine services. But don't forget to recruit additional novices or win the favor of the local Priests; these are vital means to prepare and combine the diverse actions.&#10;&#10;LUNA: In the Domain of the Moon Priestess is a challenging tactical game with strategic and interactive elements that takes about 20-25 minutes per player. The different placement of the islands and novices at the beginning of the game creates a different feeling each time you play and opens up new strategies.&#10;&#10;	\N	1	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/tMYWtENCa6qdHg3DLIDqcw__original/img/36hPaylXSE-5S4oKm6TPb9ElU6A=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic2538939.png	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/tMYWtENCa6qdHg3DLIDqcw__thumb/img/K5WlrHSW_e0JqRhu6Na_D-h5klU=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2538939.png
1109	121288	Dixit: Journey	Dixit: Journey features the same basic game play as Dixit: Each round one player takes on the role of Storyteller, choosing one card from their hand, then telling a story, singing a ditty or otherwise doing something that in their opinion is associated with the played card. Each other player then chooses one card in their own hand and gives it to the Storyteller in secret. These cards are shuffled and revealed, then players vote on which card was played by the Storyteller.&#10;&#10;If no one or everyone votes for the Storyteller, then they receive no points; if they received some votes but not all the votes, they score based on the number of votes received. Each player who submitted a correct vote or who received a vote on their card submission also scores. After a certain number of rounds, the player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;Dixit: Journey differs from Dixit in a number of ways, starting with a simplified scoring board that doesn't have players moving around a track in the bottom of the game box. Instead the scoring track is on its own board, and this game board includes a summary of the rules as well as numbered places to put the cards each round to facilitate voting. The game rules  have been revised to make the game easier to learn, while keeping game play the same.&#10;&#10;Similar to:&#10;&#10;    Dixit 3: Journey &ndash; In Europe, the cards from Dixit: Journey will be packaged as an expansion and not sold as a complete game.&#10;&#10;&#10;	\N	3	6	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/HX0lvc-JiPzf7Nrqp_N-Fw__original/img/9qsDO-TCNWxVxNZEbgLX08aYeJc=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1387599.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/HX0lvc-JiPzf7Nrqp_N-Fw__thumb/img/iInoc-itpaO_STBI1QVQ0B-WWME=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1387599.jpg
1110	2955	Mexica	Mexica plots the development of the city of Tenochtitlan on an island in Lake Texcoco. Players attempt to partition it into districts, place buildings, and construct canals.&#10;&#10;Districts are formed by completely surrounding areas of the island with water and then placing a District marker. The player who founds a district scores points immediately.&#10;&#10;Canals and Lake Texcoco act as a quick method of moving throughout the city. Players erect bridges and move from one bridge to the next, which costs 1 action point regardless of the distance. They must also erect buildings. This costs action points, the exact number being dependent upon the building's size.&#10;&#10;In the scoring phases of the game, players score points (El Grande style) based upon their dominance in a District. In the 4 player game, players with the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd most buildings score decreasing numbers of points.&#10;&#10;Only districts are scored in the first scoring round.&#10;&#10;In the second scoring round at the end of the game, all land areas are scored, not just districts.&#10;&#10;The player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;Mexica is the third game in the Mask Trilogy.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/-bOJ-MJseZ4R9SPx-NDrQw__original/img/sH9IcE1o34bIspTeSE_-NSdYdZc=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2470537.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/-bOJ-MJseZ4R9SPx-NDrQw__thumb/img/0KYcQBPLgzdLE2UqKjs-6yCtlZg=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2470537.jpg
1111	132018	Churchill	The players in the game take on the roles of Churchill, Roosevelt, or Stalin as they maneuver against each other over the course of 10 Conferences that determine who will lead the Allied forces, where those forces will be deployed, and how the Axis will be defeated. The player whose forces collectively have greater control over the surrendered Axis powers will win the peace and the game.&#10;&#10;Churchill is NOT a wargame, but a political conflict of cooperation and competition. While the game focuses on 10 of the historical conferences from 1943 till the end of the war these and much of this design should not be taken literally. Before and after each conference small groups of advisors and senior officials moved between the Allied capitals making the deals that drove the post war peace. Each conference sees one of a group of issues nominated for inclusion in the conference. The issues categories are: Theater leadership changes, directed offensives, production priorities, clandestine operations, political activity, and strategic warfare (A-bomb). Each of the historical conference cards independently puts some number of issues such as directed offensives or production priorities metaphorically put on the table, while the players nominate an additional 7 issues.&#10;&#10;The game display for this is a circular conference table that the three players sit around behind their 'seat'. Each player has a staff deck of named personages, such as Secretary Stimson and Anthony Eden that are randomly drawn to make your conference hand. A pre-conference round of cards gives leverage to the winner who then moves an issue toward their side of the table equal to the value of the card played. Play then proceeds with the conference where each player in turn plays a card on one of the issues in the center of the conference table moving it the value of the card toward his side of the table. Each card is a historical personage and they often have bonuses if played on a particular category of issue. Contesting an issue has you move an issue away from an Ally toward your own. At all times each player has his Head of State card (Roosevelt, Churchill, or Stalin) that can weigh in on any issue once per conference by discarding another card. Each use of your personage has a bonus and a potential penalty. Each time Roosevelt is used he may die and be replaced by Harry Truman. Churchill can have a heart attack and miss the next conference, while Stalin's paranoia may cause a mini-purge and reduce his side's effectiveness for the remainder of the conference. The net result of the conference play is players will 'win' various issues with the player who won the most issues gaining leverage in one of the bilateral global issues (UK versus USSR global issue is Free Europe versus Spheres of Influence).&#10;&#10;The game then moves into a post-conference phase where players implement the issues that they now control. These actions impact three basic game functions: clandestine operations, political activity, and military offensives. Clandestine operations has players try to establish political networks in conquered countries and colonies. Using a very simple mechanic of placing a network or removing an opponent's network, the historical ferment that occurred in Yugoslavia, France and across the world is simply simulated. A country or colony can only have one dominant side's network at any given time, and during political activity players can emplace friendly governments in exile that can be subsequently undermined and replaced if the supporting networks are later neutralized by one of your allies.&#10;&#10;Once this has all been sorted out, the military portion of the game keeps the score. There is a separate display that abstractly represents the major theaters of war, Western, Eastern, Mediterranean, Arctic (Murmansk convoys and Scandinavia), CBI, SW Pacific, Central Pacific, and Far East. Each of these tracks has a Allied front for which I am looking for some kind of 3D tank piece that advances toward Germany, Italy, and Japan. Using a very simple combat mechanic, each front tries to advance with Axis reserves deploying to oppose the various fronts. A successful offensive advances the front one space, although with overwhelming superiority a two-space breakthrough is possible. Naval operations are simply handled by requiring a defined level of support to advance into an amphibious entry space such as France (D-Day). When a front enters Germany, Italy or Japan they surrender, shutting down military operations, although clandestine and political activity continues until the end of the game. In the background is the development of the A-bomb and Soviet efforts to steal its secrets. If the A-bomb is available Japan can be forced to surrender sans a direct invasion.&#10;&#10;As I stated this is not a wargame, but a three-player excursion into power politics. The game takes around 3 hours to finish, but I will be including a short and medium scenario. All scenarios end with Potsdam, but you will be able to start later in the war if you only have 1 or 2 hours to play. In addition the game can be played with 3 or 2 players plus solitaire. I am very excited about the new Churchill and large scale playtesting will commence by the end of the month.

1113	150997	Shadows of Brimstone: Swamps of Death	Shadows of Brimstone: Swamps of Death is a fast-paced, fully cooperative, dungeon-crawl board game set in the Old West, with a heavy dose of unspeakable horror! Players create characters, taking on the role of a classic Western Hero Archetype, such as the Law Man, Gunslinger, or Saloon Girl. Forming an adventuring posse, the Heroes venture down into the dark mines, overrun with all manner of ancient demons and foul creatures from another world. With tactical gameplay, lots of dice, and a robust card-driven exploration system, no two games are ever the same as the heroes explore the mines finding new enemies to fight, new loot to collect, and new dangers to overcome. Players can even find portals to other worlds, stepping through to continue their adventures on the other side!&#10;&#10;An exciting campaign system allows the players to visit local frontier towns between adventures, spending their hard-earned loot and building their characters from game to game! As players find fantastic gear and artifacts to equip their heroes, they also gain experience from their adventures. This experience is used to level up, guiding the hero's path through an expansive, class-specific upgrade tree of new skills and abilities, allowing each player to develop their hero to fit their own play style.&#10;&#10;In Swamps of Death, players will encounter portals to the otherworld Jargono, a humid swampland inhabited by sentient reptiles, vicious dinosaurs and a tribe of humanoids, cut off from return to their homeworld untold years after their own portal closed.&#10;&#10;So load up yer' six shooter, throw on yer' hat and poncho, and gather the posse as the darkness is coming, and all hell's about to break loose...in the Shadows of Brimstone!&#10;&#10;Can be used together with Shadows of Brimstone: City of the Ancients to raise the maximum players to 6.&#10;&#10;	\N	1	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/qRyYKK4IxR9QBwyr7OMvzw__original/img/ZPbsr9giTmRBE7yb6gwx05rPd4o=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2037826.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/qRyYKK4IxR9QBwyr7OMvzw__thumb/img/9K95Z2kFVqnIXKCqJ4vBA2uZkm4=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2037826.jpg

The Darkness and its hordes are flooding through, stronger than ever. It will not be enough to simply close the Portals this time.

1115	231581	AuZtralia	AuZtralia is an adventure/exploration game for 1-4 players set in an alternate reality 1930s. The theme is inspired by Martin Wallace's A Study in Emerald. Following the Restorationist war, the northern hemisphere lands lay poisoned and starvation was the norm. Intrepid adventurers set out to explore and settle new lands. Little did they know, after the war, the surviving Old Ones and their remaining loyal human armies made their way to the outback of Australia to lick their wounds.  Build a port, construct railways, mine and farm for food. You&rsquo;ll need to prepare for the awakening. You&rsquo;ll need to fight.&#10;&#10;Everything you do in the game costs time, which is one of AuZtralia's most valued resources. At a point in time, the Old Ones will wake up and become an active player. They begin to reveal themselves and move, with potentially devastating outcomes. You&rsquo;ll need to prepare wisely for the awakening and may have to co-operate with others to defeat the most dangerous Old Ones.&#10;&#10;Military units will help you to locate, fight and defend against the nightmarish beings that may be lurking on your doorstep. As well as hardware, you&rsquo;ll need to recruit some Personalities who have the skills and resources to help you.&#10;&#10;Riches from the land, mixed with darkness and insanity await you in the outback. Will humanity prevail or will the Old Ones wreak their revenge?&#10;&#10;By default, the game is semi-cooperative, where one wins or everyone loses. The rulebook includes a fully cooperative variant.&#10;&#10;	\N	1	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ejsIlS4INZ23Zyd1oQd5GA__original/img/j6q9x1oUF7jI6Pl_7RwWcWJGpCE=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4144485.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ejsIlS4INZ23Zyd1oQd5GA__thumb/img/LhEU5iotxrQHpdt0hBAeQ3X5Al4=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4144485.jpg
1116	213893	Yamataï	In Yamatai, 2-4 players compete to build palaces, torii, and their own buildings in the land of Yamatai. The game includes ten numbered action tiles, each showing one or more colored ships and with most showing a special action. You shuffle these tiles, place them in a row, then reveal one more than the number of players.&#10;&#10;On a turn, each player chooses a tile, collects the depicted ships from the reserve, optionally buys or sells one ship, then places the ships on the board. The land has five entryways, and you must start from these points or place adjacent to ships already on the board. You can't branch the ships being placed, and if you place your first ship adjacent to another, then that first ship must be the same color as the adjacent one; otherwise you can place ships without regard to color.&#10;&#10;After placing ships, you can either claim colored resources from land that you've touched with new ships this turn or build on one vacant space. To build, the space must have colored ships around it that match the ships depicted on one of the available building tiles. If you build a personal building that's connected to others you own, you receive money equal to the number of buildings.&#10;&#10;You can bank one ship before the end of your turn, then you can use any three resources or a pair of matching resources to purchase a specialist, each of whom has a unique power.&#10;&#10;After all players go, you shuffle the action tiles, place them face down in the row, then reveal enough tiles at the front of the line to set up for the next turn, with the turn order being determined by the numbers on the tiles that players chose the previous turn. Once you trigger one of the game-ending conditions &mdash; e.g., no ships of one color or no more specialists &mdash; you finish the round, then count points for buildings built, specialists hired, and money on hand.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/3F1FUd4HRn2xLJpXEfmMbA__original/img/U_yoD3f629So3vkqyM0PLDys-Tk=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3357724.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/3F1FUd4HRn2xLJpXEfmMbA__thumb/img/80Hmhnfjv7BEKgHBNP6rGcM5tfk=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3357724.jpg
1117	126792	Myrmes	In Myrmes, originally shown under the name ANTerpryse, players control ant colonies and use their ants to explore the land (leaving pheromones in their wake); harvest &quot;crops&quot; like stone, earth and aphids; fight with other ants; complete requests from the Queen; birth new ants; and otherwise dominate their tiny patch of dirt, all in a quest to score points and prove that they belong at the top of the heap, er, anthill. After three seasons of scrabbling and foraging, each ant colony faces a harsh winter that will test its colonial strength.&#10;&#10;In game terms, each player has an individual game board to track what's going on inside his colony &ndash; that is, whether the nurses are tending to larvae or doing other things, where the larvae are in their growth process, what resources the colony has, which actions are available to workers when they leave the colony, and so on. The shared game board shows the landscape outside the exit tunnel that all colonies share; after exiting this tunnel, workers ants can move over the terrain to place pheromones (which gives them access to resource cubes), clean up empty pheromones (to make space), hunt prey (by discarding soldiers) or place special tiles (but only if they've developed the ant colony).&#10;&#10;The game lasts three years, and at the start of each year three season dice are rolled to determine the event for each season: extra larvae or soldiers, more VPs for actions, and so on. Within each season, players can spend larvae to adjust the event for themselves on their personal player board. (Put the kids to work!) After adjusting the event, player allocate nurses to birth larvae, worker or soldier ants or to use them for other actions. The worker ants then do their thing, working within the colony itself (although only one colony level is open initially) or traveling to the outside world to hunt prey (ladybugs, termites, spiders), lay down pheromones (which later lets them claim resources on these spaces), place special tiles (like an aphid farm or sub-colony), or clear out pheromones left by ants from any colony. After harvesting, nurses who didn't tend to births then take additional actions, such as opening a new tunnel that only your colony can use, clearing a new level within your colony, or meeting one of the six objectives (capture a certain number of prey, build special tiles, and so on) laid out at the start of the game.&#10;&#10;After three seasons, players must pay food to get their colony through winter, losing points if they can't. Whoever has the most points after three years wins. All hail our new ant overlords!&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/irYtV0aFZFz-UlhV1uMNOg__original/img/sD1dVazfYaOAnndFaa8VtJxw7EQ=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1370050.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/irYtV0aFZFz-UlhV1uMNOg__thumb/img/pc-1nA3dBW6e1KBluTMb4FRTTbI=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1370050.jpg

After wandering for hours, they end up in a mysterious grave chamber &mdash; and suddenly the stone door closes behind them. The players are caught. On the floor is a sand-covered notebook and an ancient spinning code dial. Will the players escape in time or be forever buried under stone?&#10;&#10;In Exit: The Game &ndash; The Pharaoh's Tomb, players must use their team spirit, creativity, and powers of deduction to crack codes, solve puzzles, collect objects, and earn their freedom bit by bit.&#10;&#10;	\N	1	6	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/fGO2BYF3whgNaSBZMVSO9g__original/img/rSb6fWP88631gEAuYcZX-4pRpLk=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3332423.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/fGO2BYF3whgNaSBZMVSO9g__thumb/img/UTICjkO5c4q01KusZw3NePiFvUg=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3332423.jpg
1120	29603	D-Day at Omaha Beach	Solitaire study of America's most bloody and heroic day in WWII. The player controls the US forces landing along the five mile stretch of Omaha Beach on D-Day and their desperate struggle to establish a viable beachhead. The game covers the entire first day at a time scale that varies from 15 minutes per turn (during the initial landings) to 30 minutes per turn later in the day. Units are companies and include assaulting infantry, engineers and amphibious tanks. The game system controls the hidden German defenders in their &quot;Widerstandsnest&quot; resistance points, revealing the defenders and their reserves as the American survivors of the first landing waves make their way up the bluffs. Rules cover amphibious landings, German fields of fire, artillery, tidal movement, and intangibles such as US leadership under fire and the initiative of the American GI. One map, two counter sheets, 55 cards.&#10;&#10;Additional Notes:&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;=====&#10;&#10;352 counters. Basic unit size is the US infantry company. German units consist of Widerstandsnest crews and reinforcement infantry companies. US tanks, and some US artillery, AA and anti-tank units are also included. US engineers are represented abstractly, clearing beach obstacles early in the game and opening traffic routes off the beach later in the game.&#10;&#10;The 34&quot; x 22&quot; map depicts the entire Omaha invasion area 9km long, going inland 4km, at 250 meters per hex. Hexes are oversized (almost 1&quot;) so that symbology facilitating German placement, fire and actions can be seen without having to pick up units.&#10;&#10;Time scale is 15 minutes per turn from 0600 hours to 1000 hours, shifting to 1/2 hour turns from 1000 to 1800 hours.&#10;&#10;A deck of 55 cards performs triple duty -- determining results of US amphibious landings, determining an event each turn, and determining which German units fire or perform other actions each turn.&#10;&#10;The game's solitaire system is based on that used previously in Operation Jubilee: Dieppe, August 1942.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;=================&#10;&#10;Decision Games Omaha Beach official url: http://shop.decisiongames.com/ProductDetails.asp?ProductCode=1018%2D4P&#10;&#10;	\N	1	2	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/2vp4oeiBW3sjV-z3nSXyzg__original/img/9vmemmcBNBtBPYuVSRvz4Z2Vud0=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic6112285.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/2vp4oeiBW3sjV-z3nSXyzg__thumb/img/utiWeznlJb3D2OfBpm-ceLsLr-c=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6112285.jpg
1121	204472	Sub Terra	Description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;A 1-6 player cooperative game of terrifying cave escape. Players take the role of amateur cavers attempting to escape an unexplored network of subterranean tunnels, before the lights flicker out or the darker things beneath the Earth catch up to them...&#10;&#10;In Sub Terra players spend their turn exploring and revealing the tunnel system around them, attempting to survive the various perils of the cave, from floods and cave ins to gas leaks and scree. Players each have a role which gives them specialist abilities, such as an Engineer with dynamite to blast a new route or a Scout to find a route more easily.&#10;&#10;New tiles are placed from a randomised stack of cave features, which determines whether you'll be hit with a dead end or a range of new options.&#10;&#10;At the end of each turn, players face the reality of their situation, with a hazard card drawn to determine what danger causes them damage or cuts off their way out of the horror below.&#10;&#10;These cards are finite, and when they run out, your torches flicker and the air feels tight, and your chance of survival diminishes quickly.&#10;&#10;	\N	1	6	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/47Z9FcLD20NDHdRYUaF_XA__original/img/ZS_FE1Q7_pIsd_XuOWmh_1IR8vI=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic3904427.png	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/47Z9FcLD20NDHdRYUaF_XA__thumb/img/I6Uog8mnrK4MgjiQlIMGcrQ01r8=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3904427.png

1123	342810	Marrakesh	Compete with other influential families in the city to achieve the most honorable titles through the skillful use of assistants and resources at your disposal. The player who succeeds in doing this best becomes the new &quot;Obermufti&quot; of Marrakesh.&#10;&#10;Marrakesh is played over three rounds, with each round consisting of four turns. On each turn, players simultaneously and secretly choose three colored cylinders from behind their screen. Then, in turn order, they place matching colored assistants on their player board (these will be the actions they will perform later), then all cylinders are placed in the cube tower. The cube tower randomizes which cylinders are available this round, with some getting stuck and some from previous rounds coming out.&#10;&#10;In turn order, players select a color and take 1-2 of the cylinders that have passed through the tower (or those that were stuck from a previous round but have now emerged) and place them on their player boards. These cylinders will enhance future actions taken in the same color in future rounds. Then, in turn order players will activate the regions where they have placed an assistant.&#10;&#10;Actions allow players to gain wealth, which can be traded for influence in the city. Performing various actions also earns bonuses and enhances actions even more as the game proceeds. The player who scores the most points by the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ug8yV9EVLMdjzg7FjMesSQ__original/img/HPHxPCP2l85XDtLUDFpfb0yvySM=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic7144309.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/ug8yV9EVLMdjzg7FjMesSQ__thumb/img/w-hjGWPgMpmSKsn7LbUSKHjCVFg=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7144309.jpg
1146	232219	Dragon Castle	Dragon Castle is a game freely inspired by Mahjong Solitaire. During your turn, you take a pair of identical tiles from the central &quot;castle&quot; (known as the Dragon Castle) and place them on your own realm board to build your own castle. From time to time, you may sacrifice these tiles to acquire shrines in their place.&#10;&#10;Every time you create a set of tiles of the same kind, you &quot;consolidate&quot; them, i.e. flip them face down to score points. When you consolidate a set, you may also build shrines on top of the consolidated tiles: Shrines allow you to score more points, but they also limit your building options. You may also take advantage of the available spirit card and its game-changing powers...but this will come at a cost! Finally, don't forget to check the dragon card in play, and to follow the building requirements to score bonus points.&#10;&#10;When the Dragon Castle has been reduced to only one floor, the end of the game is triggered. After one final round, the player with the most points is the lord of the new Dragon Castle&hellip;and the winner of the game!&#10;&#10;	\N	1	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/LvBG5jXW8ZFyllrbyJme-A__original/img/u8VQUhndzJDGh1EWdLx4FdsAnWE=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic3683059.png	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/LvBG5jXW8ZFyllrbyJme-A__thumb/img/rmPTY8XdFru_9M_Ty68j4LpK10A=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3683059.png
1124	123540	Tokaido	In Tokaido, each player is a traveler crossing the &quot;East sea road&quot;, one of the most magnificent roads of Japan. While traveling, you will meet people, taste fine meals, collect beautiful items, discover great panoramas, and visit temples and wild places but at the end of the day, when everyone has arrived at the end of the road you'll have to be the most initiated traveler &ndash; which means that you'll have to be the one who discovered the most interesting and varied things.&#10;&#10;The potential action spaces in Tokaido are laid out on a linear track, with players advancing down this track to take actions. The player who is currently last on the track takes a turn by advancing forward on the track to their desired action and taking that action, so players must choose whether to advance slowly in order to get more turns, or to travel more rapidly to beat other players to their desired action spaces.&#10;&#10;The action spaces allow a variety of actions that will score in different, but roughly equal, ways. Some action spaces allow players to collect money, while others offer players a way to spend that money to acquire points.  Other action spaces allow players to engage in various set collections that score points for assembling those sets.  Some action spaces simply award players points for stopping on them, or give the player a randomly determined action from all of the other types.&#10;&#10;All of the actions in Tokaido are very simple, and combined with a unique graphic design, Tokaido offers players a peaceful zen mood in its play.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	5	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/81z-qIsx51gT1PDRGQ_dDA__original/img/CooNWBRczlMPhvQDv9PvvNJaW54=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic7739376.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/81z-qIsx51gT1PDRGQ_dDA__thumb/img/wzNpF81MUGkBCoCR8VIHwZyQK4I=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7739376.jpg

Two to four summoners encounter each other in the Tash-Kalar arena, either in teams or each on his own, and prove their skill and strategy in a short but intense battle. By clever deployment of their minions, they create magic patterns for summoning powerful beings, and then use those to destroy their opponent&rsquo;s forces or to prepare patterns for the ultimate legendary beings.&#10;&#10;The game includes four different factions, each with a unique deck of beings to summon and one deck of legendary creatures. Players take turns placing their common pieces on the board, and if they succeed in creating patterns depicted on one of the cards in hand, they may play it. When played, the card summons a particular being and allows the player to perform an effect described on the card: a giant destroys neighboring pieces, a knight moves through enemy pieces, a warlord orders previously placed pieces to move and fight, an enchantress converts enemy pieces to player's own color, etc. After that, the player discards the card and the summoned being turns into a motionless piece which may be used in patterns for summoning other beings &ndash; or even be awakened and moved into combat by the effects of other cards.&#10;&#10;Tash-Kalar: Arena of Legends offers two game modes. In the standard mode you score points for fulfilling various quests set by the Arena Masters: controlling certain points or areas of the arena, destroying a number of enemy pieces in a single turn, performing a certain combination of summonings, etc.&#10;&#10;In melee mode, your only goal is to entertain the crowd. You do that by destroying your opponents and making them beg (i.e., making them use the catch-up mechanisms) and by summoning legendary beings. After all, people want to see a dragon! Both modes can be played as a two-player duel or as a team game with teammates sharing pieces and legendary cards, but with each controlling his own faction. (The game includes a duplicate of one faction in a different color.) The melee mode can also be played as a fierce free-for-all battle, but don't expect alliances; to achieve a good score, you need to destroy all opponents evenly as you track points scored on each opponent separately, and your lowest score is your final score.&#10;&#10;The rules of Tash-Kalar: Arena of Legends are simple and easy to understand, but as you start to discover the tactics and are able to anticipate the opponent's moves and patterns, it turns into a real clash of wits.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/woifEuhjEe-0VPKtPcwaIw__original/img/EisNAxSKPu0TQOv0KKiPBGdetQ8=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1875045.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/woifEuhjEe-0VPKtPcwaIw__thumb/img/PwCqGHn47oqbKt7aJdkhKb4JG_A=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1875045.jpg
1128	301255	Whistle Mountain	Whistle Stop designer Scott Caputo has teamed up with Luke Laurie (Manhattan Project: Energy Empire) to create a new worker-placement strategy title. Whistle Mountain gives a nod to Whistle Stop, but in this standalone game, you leave the train tracks behind and head to the sky with blimps, dreadnoughts, and hot air balloons!&#10;&#10;In Whistle Mountain, take your company's massive profits from all of that railroading and invest them in new technologies, deep in the Rocky Mountains where there is an abundance of resources. Your workers build crazy arrays of scaffolds and machines, upgrading your abilities and collecting resources. As you build with the help of your airship fleet, the mountain's melting snow causes the water below to rise higher and higher, putting workers in danger and increasing the tension on the dynamically-changing board.&#10;&#10;Because the resources you gather are determined by what players build, each game evolves differently, resulting in endless replayability. You have to choose between acquiring new abilities and enhancements for your airships and workers or building all sorts of contraptions as quickly as possible in order to achieve victory on Whistle Mountain.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/BkPVVNEJxnF2ouque0ov8A__original/img/KBbDQ_YZG_JF_rkniAKYupJLYnI=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5275651.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/BkPVVNEJxnF2ouque0ov8A__thumb/img/eLl5tVSfUn2f95-87zcJz8rxiFk=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5275651.jpg

1130	173064	Leaving Earth	The year is 1956.  Mankind stands at the dawn of a new age, the Space Age, when the flying bombs of yesteryear will become the rocket ships of tomorrow.  As the director of a national space program, your country is depending on you for success in this great contest.  You may be the first to create an artificial satellite, send a probe to another planet, or even put a man on the moon.&#10;&#10;Leaving Earth is a game about planning and about managing risk.  With even a single grand journey into outer space, you might claim victory in the game.  Consequently, it is your job to plan each journey carefully, finding the cheapest, quickest, and safest ways to reach your objective&mdash;but do not spend too long preparing, or another nation might reach its goal before you.&#10;&#10;On your turn, you will be conducting research, building spacecraft, and directing journeys into outer space. To conduct research, you buy an advancement that begins with certain flaws, then you test the advancement to find and eliminate those flaws.  To build a spacecraft, you purchase components and assemble them into a whole. To travel to outer space, you expend rockets to maneuver from one location to another.&#10;&#10;	\N	1	5	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/rpjQ2X1g2fau-VsgAYvo2A__original/img/PA_s9w-JeySUq-2DvbAOnZ9Sl30=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2624698.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/rpjQ2X1g2fau-VsgAYvo2A__thumb/img/Mryb8qHHoDA9nYeA0K8gKugHCWw=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2624698.jpg
1131	165401	Wir sind das Volk!	1949: Germany, still in ruins from WWII, is split in two, as the Iron Curtain of the Cold War descends. East Germany and West Germany become bitter rivals, each wanting to show its system is superior. Which will reconstruct quicker? Which will make its people happier? Socialism vs Capitalism; collectivism vs individualism - which will triumph?&#10;&#10;Wir sind das Volk! (&quot;We are the people!&quot; &mdash; the main slogan of the East German demonstrators in 1989) recreates the history of the divided Germany, from the Berlin Airlift to the fall of the Berlin Wall. Flowing from how the 84 individually designed action cards are played, each game is different. There are many possible strategies. Will East Germany build the Wall or stem the exodus of its citizens another way?&#10;&#10;East vs West: as a player, you take the role of East or West Germany. Use your action cards wisely. Build up your economy and increase the living standards of your people. Don&rsquo;t fall behind, or you will face widespread unrest. Also win the contest for international prestige. Precise planning is the key to victory. But be careful! Even the best plans may be derailed by events like the 1973 Oil Crisis or the Monday demos. Mass protests, that may seal your fate, are always on the horizon.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	2	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/em65Za2y7FNo-otQ6IgUCQ__original/img/cCyRJX4pyij34e2YFsQ_XoNPEEs=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2239210.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/em65Za2y7FNo-otQ6IgUCQ__thumb/img/UAL4JsaK6Rph7YS0lxDOKG1kWrw=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2239210.jpg

1134	7717	Carcassonne: The Castle	Carcassonne: the Castle takes place in the city of Carcassone itself. The theme is development of the city within the &quot;castle walls&quot;, which might be more appropriately called the city walls, but Carcassonne: The City was apparently already in development.&#10;&#10;It is not an expansion, but a stand-alone tile-placement game with the Carcassonne mechanics adapted specially for two players. The goal is to lead the race around the castle wall, which is also the scoring track for the game. There are bonus items on the wall for the first player to reach that point.&#10;&#10;Play is very similar to Carcassonne but all the tiles must be played within the walls, which often constrains the choices. The followers used for scoring are heralds (on paths), knights (on towers), squires (on houses) and merchants (on courtyards which are more valuable if they have a market). And, the player with the largest &quot;keep&quot; (largest house completed during the game) scores points for the largest contiguous undeveloped area (unplayed tile spaces) at the end of the game. The bonus tiles collected from the walls add twists to the scoring, such as doubling one of a particular scoring structure or scoring one uncompleted structure.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	2	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/b93sGgQU_QKNRsynhBAuVA__original/img/9vQ0FpVgmflETrExB8PJjeNeKdo=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2606367.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/b93sGgQU_QKNRsynhBAuVA__thumb/img/RsiqZlVAQ0PKiV9NeIn14Vbpe1s=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2606367.jpg
1135	168584	Love Letter: Batman	Love Letter: Batman is a game of risk, deduction, and luck for 2&ndash;4 players based on the original Love Letter game by Seiji Kanai. The deck consists mostly of criminals, with Joker being the most valuable card at #8, Harley Quinn at #7, and so on, with Robin showing up at #4 and Batman as #1, which is the guard in the original Love Letter. Your goal is either to hold &mdash; that is, have captured &mdash; the highest valued card at the end of the round or to be the final player active in the round.&#10;&#10;From a deck with only sixteen cards, each player starts with only one card in hand; one card is removed from play. On a turn, you draw one card, and play one card, using the power on that card to expose others and (possibly) knock them out of the round. If you use Batman's ability to KO someone (other than Robin), you score one point, with points being tracked via Batsignal tokens. If you're the final player active in the round or the player with the highest card when the deck runs out, then you score a point.&#10;&#10;The game ends following the round in which someone has seven or more points, and the player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/PWa3bk0_hc3h9wes51e2gA__original/img/IQtAddXlLb6o6sqaem7J4n7NL5g=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2290765.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/PWa3bk0_hc3h9wes51e2gA__thumb/img/SxEtASAGYnXBmWKaSNtXgUu3f78=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2290765.jpg

1137	156336	Onirim (Second Edition)	You are a Dreamwalker, lost in a mysterious labyrinth, and you must discover the oneiric doors before your dreamtime runs out &ndash; or you will remain trapped forever!&#10;&#10;You may wander through the chambers of dreams, hoping that chance will reveal the doors, or you can linger in each type of room. In both cases, you will have to deal with the slithering Nightmares, which haunt the hallways of the labyrinth.&#10;&#10;Onirim is a solo/cooperative card game. You (and a partner, if you wish) must work (together) against the game to gather the eight Door cards before the deck runs out; you can obtain those Door cards either by playing cards of the same color three turns in a row, or by discarding (under specific circumstances) one of your powerful Key cards. In both cases you will have to decide the best use of each card in your hand and carefully play around the Nightmares. Those cards are hidden in the deck and will trigger painful dilemmas when drawn...&#10;&#10;Seven mini-expansions, all standalone and compatible with one another, are included with the second edition of Onirim, including these three that were in the first edition of the game:&#10;&#10;&#10;    &quot;The Towers&quot; introduces a new type of card that allows more searching and deck manipulation, while also imposing an additional victory condition.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    &quot;Happy Dreams and Dark Premonitions&quot; adds evil time bombs that will impede your progress at predictable moments of your quest as well as helpful but unreliable allies.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    In &quot;The Book of Steps Lost and Found&quot;, you must find the eight Door cards in a randomly given order and may remove discarded cards from the game to cast powerful spells that will help you complete this difficult task.&#10;&#10;&#10;In addition to these three variants from the first edition, there are four new modules in the Onirim 2nd edition box. Just like previously, each module consists of something that makes the game easier and something that makes the game harder:&#10;&#10;&#10;    &quot;The Glyphs&quot; introduces a fourth symbol on location cards (apart from Key, Sun and Moon), which makes it easier to compose the row of unrepeated symbols. Player must then find one extra door of each color (so 12 doors in total) to win&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    &quot;The Dreamcatchers&quot; are four cards that &quot;guard&quot; the Limbo piles. The Limbo pile stays with Dreamcatcher until some effect allows the player to shuffle the pile back to the deck... if all Dreamcatchers are full and new cards should come to Limbo, a Dreamcatcher is discarded and his cards shuffled back. Also, four new &quot;Lost Dreams&quot; cards are supposed to be in Limbo at the end of the game, as an extra winning condition - so discarding all Dreamcatchers means loss.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    &quot;The Crossroads and Dead Ends&quot; introduce location cards with a given symbol (3 Sun, 2 Moon, 1 Key), but serving as any color &quot;joker&quot;. It also contains 10 &quot;Dead End&quot; cards, that remain in players hand (un-discard-able on its own) and block her 5-cards hand limit... until a player discards the whole hand (=the only way to discard a Dead End).&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    &quot;The Door To The Oniverse&quot; brings several one-time abilities cards as &quot;inhabitants of the Oniverse&quot;... and one extra colorless door to find.&#10;&#10;&#10;Apart from all those, there are a few special rules to use the dark meeple in the game (which interferes with Nightmare cards resolving), making the game easier or harder, depending on the chosen variant.&#10;&#10;	\N	1	2	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/he3CDoTsu5Yc9cK8NROYYg__original/img/TUHsIzer8xat16k9zm5jv35W6gg=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic6863738.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/he3CDoTsu5Yc9cK8NROYYg__thumb/img/KmxUwcW-u23JYg7xq4FIgAr0z5Y=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6863738.jpg

At the beginning of each round, the dice are rolled and grouped by their respective types. On your turn, you must either draft a new die or utilize the untapped potency of a previously drafted die. Based on the material associated with your chosen die, you will be able to collect certain essences in addition to the material to which the die is keyed. Additionally, the color of the die will determine which types of transmutations you can perform, refining raw materials and increasing your mastery of the elements.&#10;&#10;Acquire precious artifacts in order to maximize the effects of your transmutations.

1140	160495	ZhanGuo	Between 230 and 221 B.C., the ambitious and extremely young king of Qin, Ying Zheng, unified China, adding all the other so-called Warring States (ZhanGuo) to his empire. Through this, Ying Zheng became the first emperor in Chinese history, taking the title of Qin Shi Huang Di.&#10;&#10;Plenty of things had to change in order to make the Chinese empire whole, and Qin Shi Huang Di didn't waste any time. He divided the empire into prefectures, personally appointing central and local functionaries; afterward, he decreed that the same writing symbols had to be used throughout the entire nation. Furthermore, he unified the laws and the units of measure, particularly the currency, creating amazing conditions for the economic development and growth of the empire.&#10;&#10;Internal decisions were not the only things that shaped this new unified nation. From the North, the menace of the Hsiungnu barbarians kept shaking the empire, and Qin Shi Huang Di knew that the only way to stop that menace was to build one of the most ambitious buildings in human history: The Great Wall of China. Thousands of peasants left their fields to take part in the construction, not only of the Great Wall, but also of roads, channels, palaces, and majestic buildings.&#10;&#10;In ZhanGuo, you are the emperor's emissaries, and you have been assigned the challenging task of contributing to the process of unifying the empire, helping to build the wall, and all infrastructures needed. During the five rounds of the game, you must make the best of the few cards you get each round. You can play each card either on your own player board to increase your personal power in the empire, or on the game board to recruit manpower, construct buildings wanted by the emperor, call reinforcements from Qin, and move the armies from kingdom to kingdom.&#10;&#10;Each player has to choose the best time and best way to play his cards in order to earn the emperor&rsquo;s favors. Careful, though, because trying to get too much power, or exploiting the workers for personal gain could increase dissatisfaction among the populace, and consequently increase the risk of uprisings in the newly added kingdoms. Whoever is able to make the greatest contribution to the emperor's cause, while at the same time keeping the citizens placid, will be the winner.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/asueS9har0y10uk672cbGw__original/img/nq95-sVAgp9Hc4nNi8UMrJt2LFw=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2242246.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/asueS9har0y10uk672cbGw__thumb/img/80v16ohwO4WQNiR6Yoo_9IHI2NY=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2242246.jpg

Items like flash grenades, scanners, and the like are at the disposal of this covert agent.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	5	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/lVFArtZrwFEDo23sDcSMEg__original/img/HBIgIDOUXTLThknCM1PJsEtvJi8=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2486481.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/lVFArtZrwFEDo23sDcSMEg__thumb/img/pky3rb47HJv8jcNPjV3jbDB7o4c=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2486481.jpg
1142	71721	Space Hulk: Death Angel – The Card Game	A cooperative game where the players attempt to clean out an infestation of hostile aliens from a derelict spaceship. Set in the Warhammer 40,000 universe, players take on the roles of Space Marines pitted against hordes of Genestealers.&#10;&#10;Players choose from six different combat teams, each consisting of two Space Marines with different abilities. Each player receives three Action cards for each of his combat teams. After all of the Space Marines have fallen into formation, prepare for the first wave of Genestealers.&#10;&#10;Game play is quick and easy to learn. Each game is played over a series of rounds, broken up into phases. During the Choose Actions Phase, each player must secretly determine which of the following Action cards they wish to play on their Space Marines: Support, Attack, or Move + Activate. You can't pick the same Action card next round, so choose wisely.&#10;&#10;Action resolution keeps all players involved while the overwhelming odds inspire them to work together to survive. The Action Resolution Phase consists of each player revealing and carrying out their chosen Action. The lowest number card goes first, which means Attacks are resolved after Supports. Support tokens enable Space Marines to re-roll, so make sure to cover your fellow Blood Angels.&#10;&#10;The Genestealer Attack Phase happens after all the Actions have been resolved, so hopefully you thinned out the swarms since you have to roll higher than the number of Genestealers in the swarm to successfully defend. Finally, an Event card is drawn to spawn more alien adversaries. Once all the Genestealers have emerged from the darkness, its time to move forward, drawing a new location card. And then it's back into the fight!&#10;&#10;	\N	1	6	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/B0fdjhzvOdTJD65h1_1BNA__original/img/W0vJoYzQUzgD_ETBFIAKxiJnl5s=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1873572.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/B0fdjhzvOdTJD65h1_1BNA__thumb/img/Pq1eC0bNF2PGeiusEjMpf01WiLI=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1873572.jpg
1143	353288	Trekking Through History	We designed Trekking through History for gamers and non-gamers to play together. The goal was to make a game inviting for non-gamers, but with a little subtlety under the hood for gamers.&#10;&#10;In the game, you go on a three-day tour of human history, traveling thousands of years in a time machine to experience great moments from our past.&#10;&#10;The game takes place over three rounds, each representing one day of your trip. Each day, you visit a series of historical events, spending a different number of hours at each.&#10;&#10;On each turn, you choose to visit one historical event, and spend a certain number of hours doing it. Doing so will yield benefits, like checking off items on your itinerary for points, and earning Time Crystals so you can bend the space-time continuum on future turns.&#10;&#10;Along the way, you&rsquo;ll also score points for visiting historical events in chronological order.&#10;&#10;The player with the most points after three rounds wins.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/9VimKoKMxKiulhjeOFZLnw__original/img/SjWThtNzxQWmpbVotkZ5M8e1vVs=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic6637421.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/9VimKoKMxKiulhjeOFZLnw__thumb/img/FGSFNkJ_aQnftvTT1EP7nQ8PHvU=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6637421.jpg

1148	328479	Living Forest	In Living Forest, you play as a nature spirit who will try to save the forest and its sacred tree from the flames of Onibi. But you are not alone in your mission as the animal guardians have come together to lend a hand around the Circle of Spirits where you progress. Each turn, they bring you valuable elements, so try to combine your team of animal guardians as best as possible to carry out your actions, but be careful: some of them are solitary and do not like to be mixed with others...&#10;&#10;You have one of three ways to achieve your goal: by planting 12 different Protective Trees, by collecting 12 Sacred Flowers to awaken Sanki the great Guardian of the Forest, by extinguishing 12 Fires to permanently repel Onibi.&#10;&#10;Each turn includes 3 phases: &#10;&bull; Guardian Animals (simultaneous push your luck phase) : You draw and turn face up, one after the other, the Guardian Animal cards from your personal stack. You thus form the Animal Guardian Help Line. You can stop drawing cards whenever you want. However, if you reveal a card showing a third solitary symbol, then you must stop drawing cards. This card closes your Help Line.&#10;&bull; Action phase: You play in turn. If your Help Line shows strictly less than three solitary symbols (not canceled by gregarious symbols), you can then perform 2 different Actions. If your Help Line shows three solitary symbols (not canceled by gregarious symbols), you can then perform only 1 Action. The strength of an Action is determined by the number of corresponding Elements visible on the Guardian Animal cards in your Help Line and on your Forest individual board.&#10;&bull; End of the turn:&#10;- Onibi attacks you: If some Fires remain at the center of the Circle of Spirits and you cannot resist them, then add as many Fire Varan cards to your discard stack as there are Fire tiles at the center of the Circle of Spirits.&#10;- Onibi attacks the Sacred Tree: Add as many Fires to the center of the Circle of Spirits as there are Guardian Animal cards taken this turn.&#10;- The arrival of new Guardian Animals: Complete the Guardian Animal reserve by revealing as many new cards per level as there were cards taken this turn.&#10;- Passing the Sacred Tree: Give the Sacred Tree to the next Spirit of Nature clockwise.&#10;- The Return of Guardian Animals: Move all the Animal Guardian cards from your Help Line to your personal discard stack.&#10;&#10;The game stops at the end of a complete turn when one of the Spirits of Nature has managed to collect at least 12 different Protective Trees OR 12 Fires OR 12 Sacred Flowers.&#10;&#10;	\N	1	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/fPhdfZX9UTLr4-SVgK0zoQ__original/img/ZPdxDPt1jSRQMNnVgn-qIPhNv0E=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5899025.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/fPhdfZX9UTLr4-SVgK0zoQ__thumb/img/v8irnVxaCdK29XPtqEbtlKkLY4c=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5899025.jpg

1150	167400	Ashes Reborn: Rise of the Phoenixborn	In Ashes: Rise of the Phoenixborn, a two-player expandable card game, players take on the roles of Phoenixborns, demi-gods and protectors of this world. These characters are the great saviors of their civilizations. Before they came into existence, the humans were plagued by monsters like chimeras that took away their lands and forced them to live in walled-off cities. When the Phoenixborns came, they fought off the chimeras and freed the lands for humans to take over once again.&#10;&#10;But the time of peace was short-lived. A prophecy arose that if one Phoenixborn was able to absorb enough Ashes of others, they would ascend into full gods and take mastery over this world. This, as well as humans' greed for land, fueled the War of Ashes. The great cities now fight among each other, each one of them with a Phoenixborn at its helm, and you will decide who will rise and who will fall to ashes.&#10;&#10;Ashes Reborn: Rise of the Phoenixborn, released in 2021, features the same Phoenixborn as in the original Ashes with the same cards, but some cards have been modified to balance them. (Publisher Plaid Hat Games estimates that about 30% of all cards across all expansions are being modified.) The rules have undergone a few changes as well, mostly to clarify powers. The Ashes Reborn 1.5 Upgrade Kit contains more than 350+ updated Ashes cards, along with an updated rulebook, allowing players to move from the original game to the new 1.5 rules.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/BxBWqnm98y1qgk9cEmStgQ__original/img/QK9ku5RxaXxttpT_zA4-l-rSIX4=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5868255.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/BxBWqnm98y1qgk9cEmStgQ__thumb/img/hMH88NFG6vP60vUif6fTr1ctsOA=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5868255.jpg

Each heroine's powers manifest in a different form, with players controlling sound, paper, technology, gravity, triangles, and more!&#10;&#10;Turns are simultaneous. Place bullets in your sight, with the color of bullet determining the column and the number how far down in that column it is placed. Use actions to manipulate bullets to form configurations matching your patterns. Using a pattern removes bullets from your sight and sends them to the opponent. When placing bullets, you skip over existing bullets in the column you place it in, with the bullet hitting you if it is placed off your sight. At the end of the turn, you'll gain even more bullets from the center bag as well as what the opponent sent, ensuring each new turn is more hectic than the last!&#10;&#10;Choosing what order to place bullets, use actions, and use patterns in is key to staying alive as long as possible!

1151	214880	City of the Big Shoulders	After the great Chicago Fire of 1871, the brave men and women of Chicago sought to rebuild their once-great city, and rebuild it they did. Over the next 60 years Chicago experienced an economic golden age, making such great progress that it hosted The World's Columbian Exposition in 1893, followed not long after by a celebration of its Century of Progress at The World's Fair in 1933.&#10;&#10;Many of the household brands we've come to know and love today had their start in Chicago during this time period; Oscar Mayer, Kraft, Quaker Oats, Nabisco, Swift &amp; Co, Armour &amp; Co, Schwinn Bicycles, Charles Schwab, and many others made a home here in this tall, bold slugger.&#10;&#10;In City of the Big Shoulders players take on the roles of entrepreneurs and investors seeking to rebuild Chicago into a city fit for the world stage. In this unique merger of 18xx-style stock manipulation mechanics with euro-style gameplay, players start companies, trade in shares, hire employees, equip their factories, produce goods and sell them to be delivered to homes across the midwest.&#10;&#10;Although City of the Big Shoulders features a large amount of strategic depth and rewarding gameplay, it does so in a shorter timeline than is typical of most heavy economic games. Players play just five rounds (also known as decades) in about two and a half hours. Each decade consists of five unique phases: A stock phase where players can buy and sell stock; a building phase where players rebuild the city of Chicago, placing action spaces on the board; an action phase where companies send their partners to make deals across Chicago; an Operating Phase where companies buy resources, produce goods, and ship them out of Chicago; and finally a cleanup phase where the board is set up for the following decade. At the end of the fifth decade, the game ends. Players then exchange shares that they have purchased over the course of the game for cash, are rewarded for any of the public goals they have accomplished over the five decades of play, and tally their money to determine who is Chicago's greatest resident.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/JImiygpumS35fVxlfsRPXw__original/img/7uft3DL-UNgIE2MQ_B_RbdsBQKw=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4223934.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/JImiygpumS35fVxlfsRPXw__thumb/img/4JoMwGJySRhnioxER3OEj6r0uYg=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4223934.jpg
1152	162007	Steampunk Rally	Steampunk Rally is a strategy game that incorporates steampunk as more than just a bit of chrome. Using a unique dice-placement mechanism, players take on the roles of famous inventors from the turn of the last century like Nikola Tesla and Marie Curie, constructing fantastical contraptions that make use of steam, heat and electricity in an attempt to win a no-holds-barred race through the Swiss alps.&#10;&#10;Each round starts with a card draft in which players carefully select machine parts to add to their invention and one-shot boost cards to aid them or hinder opponents. Players also have the option of discarding drafted cards for dice or cogs to power their invention, but they must make this tricky choice when each card is drafted.&#10;&#10;Then, after venting dice to revitalize their machines, players roll their dice and use them to activate machine parts which provide things like movement, shielding, and additional dice with which to activate more parts. Driving through terrain causes damage, and if a player's damage gauge ends up in the red at the end of the turn, they must lose parts from their invention. These will need to be replaced in the draft phase, constantly forcing players to discover new synergies.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	8	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/x7ZIq-jb6z10UJiv_8wsyg__original/img/s3KmeeFsWo3DzkaVzfORXEHfGWM=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2073821.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/x7ZIq-jb6z10UJiv_8wsyg__thumb/img/URNMA8H29TNXaMhjNvxdV4Xvql8=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2073821.jpg
1153	143741	BANG! The Dice Game	In the U.S. wild west, the eternal battle between the law and the outlaws keeps heating up. Suddenly, a rain of arrows darken the sky: It's an Indian attack! Are you bold enough to keep up with the Indians? Do you have the courage to challenge your fate? Can you expose and defeat the ruthless gunmen around you?&#10;&#10;BANG! The Dice Game keeps the core of the Bang! card game in place. At the start of the game, players each take a role card that secretly places them on a team: the Sheriff and deputies, outlaws, and renegades. The Sheriff and deputies need to kill the outlaws, the outlaws win by killing the Sheriff, and the renegades want to be the last players alive in the game.&#10;&#10;Each player also receives a character card which grants him a special power in the game. The Sheriff reveals his role card and takes the first turn of the game. On a turn, a player can roll the five dice up to three times, using the results of the dice to shoot neighboring players, increase the range of his shots, heal his (or anyone else's) life points, or put him in range of the Indians, which are represented by nine tokens in the center of the table. Each time a player rolls an arrow, he takes one of these tokens; when the final token is taken, each player loses one life point for each token he holds, then the tokens are returned to the center of the table.&#10;&#10;If a player collects a trio of Gatling symbols on the dice, he fires one shot at everyone else and rids himself of Indian tokens. Who'll get his shot off first? Play continues until one team meets its winning condition &ndash; and death won't necessarily keep you from winning as long as your teammates pull through!&#10;&#10;	\N	3	8	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/BLTFau1Ue-gjX6geQdYrjQ__original/img/3CcRDvDttHpWLP6wc_jZHufTfl4=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2909713.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/BLTFau1Ue-gjX6geQdYrjQ__thumb/img/IijBpyOQC760F6XIw34WT0ePqe4=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2909713.jpg
1154	249381	The Estates	The City Council recently approved the zoning map for a new urban development &mdash; The Estates &mdash; featuring high-end infrastructure and a modern atmosphere for its citizens. Soon after, the banks awarded millions of dollars in loans to six real estate investment firms to help develop this new area. The zoning map for The Estates calls for two rows of four buildings each, located between the River and Main Street. The meadows on the other side of the River are to remain a recreational area for the City.&#10;&#10;But, with hopes of larger profits, investors and building tycoons entirely ignore the City Council's demands and begin developing three rows of buildings instead. The Mayor catches wind of the potential for profit and begins planning a new mansion in The Estates, which would double the value of one of the building rows! With some sketchy building permits, investors begin developing buildings on the other side of the River, beyond the designated building zone. However, the City Council takes rigorous steps to put an end to the racketeering with an ultimatum: As soon as the first two rows are completed, the buildings in the uncompleted row will be torn down, resulting in a huge loss for all who invested there. At the end of the day, the investor with the highest-valued buildings will come out on top.&#10;&#10;The players take on the role of investors seeking to make the most money by developing buildings in The Estates. Players will bid for the various building pieces and place them in The Estates to their benefit. All buildings in completed rows score positive points, while all buildings in incomplete rows score negative points. It is possible to have zero completed rows of buildings.&#10;&#10;A game of The Estates lasts around 40 minutes and can be played in several rounds to experience a shifting economy.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	5	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/AvC3AzHo8JlcvgKtQ3PDWA__original/img/bLkTdJ11F1JN8zUU4dPjR0J3_2k=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4071903.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/AvC3AzHo8JlcvgKtQ3PDWA__thumb/img/eMsTjGHKNFzWiw7uNiOKDLtYcq4=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4071903.jpg
1155	226320	My Little Scythe	My Little Scythe is a competitive, family-friendly game in which each player controls 2 animal miniatures embarking upon an adventure in the Kingdom of Pomme.&#10;&#10;In an effort to be the first to earn 4 trophies from 8 possible categories, players take turns choosing to Move, Seek, or Make. These actions will allow players to increase their friendship and pies, power up their actions, complete quests, learn magic spells, deliver gems and apples to Castle Everfree, and perhaps even engage in a pie fight.&#10;&#10;Some of My Little Scythe&rsquo;s mechanisms are inspired by the bestselling game, Scythe.

1157	72321	The Networks	In The Networks, you and your opponents are new television networks, and you need new programming. For this, you&rsquo;ll need Shows, Stars, and Ads.&#10;&#10;Shows need Stars and Ads. Stars give you bonus viewers (points), and Ads give you extra money. You&rsquo;ll need everything you can get; you'll have a small amount of resources and time, and you must grab the latest hot show before your opponents.&#10;&#10;And some Stars will give their best effort only if you put them on in the proper conditions. For example, some Stars only want to be put on dramas. Other Stars want to be the only Star on the show. And your Ads will give you the most money only if you put them on in the correct time slot.&#10;&#10;Finally, Shows age and viewers lose interest, so you have to keep your line-up fresh by canceling shows and sending them into reruns. Fortunately, you can get viewers from your reruns, and you'll get bonuses if you get a lot of shows of the same genre throughout the game.&#10;&#10;If you need a special push, Network Cards can give you special powers &mdash; but will a Network Card be better than another action? You'll have to make that call.&#10;&#10;The player with the most viewers after five seasons wins!&#10;&#10;	\N	1	5	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/3Mjt1-JxuXV_hamkypi0mw__original/img/l5aY9TSIwKeclKKziKB4FrTQewk=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2896170.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/3Mjt1-JxuXV_hamkypi0mw__thumb/img/5KiCIZrcPJ6AkX9FJb0E2RGxM3Y=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2896170.jpg

Whether or not their plan will work out, one thing is certain: Not every guest will leave this inn alive.&#10;&#10;The Bloody Inn is a card game in which you play one member of a family of greedy, murderous innkeepers. At the start of each round, cards are placed face up to fill the inn with guests. Each card carries a cost representing how many cards a player must discard from her hand in order to take an action related to that card. Certain guests have an affinity for particular actions, so those cards return to a player's hand after being discarded. Cards also show how much money, in francs, each guest possesses. A round has two phases in which players take one action each, in turn order. Players choose one of the following actions:&#10;&#10;     bribe a guest into becoming an accomplice (take a card from the inn to their hand)&#10;     build an annex (move a card from their hand to their player area; it now represents a structure under which a victim may be buried)&#10;     kill a guest (move a card from the inn to their player area, awaiting burial)&#10;     bury a victim (place an unburied victim card under an annex card and take the money from the victim's pockets)&#10;     launder money (players may only have a certain amount of cash on hand; excess must be converted to 10F checks by the local notary)&#10;&#10;&#10;At the end of the round, if any room of the inn contains one of the police, then they conduct an investigation; if a player has any unburied victims, then he must pay 10F per victim to the local gravedigger to hurredly &mdash; and quietly &mdash; bury the bodies! Lastly in the round, any cards (accomplices) in each player's hand must be paid 1F each. After the guest deck has been depleted the second time, players take a final round, then tally their francs. The player with the most money wins!&#10;&#10;	\N	1	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/GTUmt2ViVzJOT4ZKXbq2Zg__original/img/8dJoI4olAHxnPu7n4PiXTmyGJ20=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2618699.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/GTUmt2ViVzJOT4ZKXbq2Zg__thumb/img/h-GMHsoeG4S6wRVjzlMGmP0UmQE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2618699.jpg
1160	241724	Villagers	You are the founder of a new village during the middle ages, in the years after a great plague. The loss of so many people has created big problems for the survivors. Many of the people the villagers used to depend on for essential things like food, shelter and clothes are gone. Craftsmen find themselves without suppliers of raw materials, traders have lost their customers and many have lost their farms and workshops as they escaped the plague.&#10;&#10;The roads are full of refugees seeking a new beginning. They come to you, hoping to settle down on your land and make a living. Your grain farm is the ideal starting point for a village, reliably providing food for many people. You must choose wisely who you allow to settle with you, as your food and resources are limited.&#10;&#10;The people on the road have valuable and unique skills, but they all in turn rely on other people with very specific crafts to be able to work. Raw materials, tools and services must be provided by other people from the road.&#10;&#10;If you manage to find people that can work together to make a profit, while increasing your food surplus and capacity for building new houses, your village will be prosperous.&#10;&#10;The game comes with a solo mode where a lone village strives to prosper in spite of the dreaded Countess and her evil machinations.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;	\N	1	5	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/rMMSvnXuBPZSihIaVtVT-A__original/img/PivWbEOFSDhHXl2NCHw8xSErORA=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic4996383.png	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/rMMSvnXuBPZSihIaVtVT-A__thumb/img/IkNfLIRXNN3cwFLItdj56VnREm0=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4996383.png
1165	73761	K2	K2 is the second-highest mountain on Earth as well as the second deadliest. It's known as the Savage Mountain, as it kills one person for every four who have reached the summit... Now your team stands in its shadow, ready to climb for fame and glory.&nbsp;&#10;&#10;K2 is a board game in which each player controls a team of 2 mountaineers, trying to climb to the summit of K2 and return before the other players' teams and before the mountain kills them. Every player uses an identical deck of cards. You use the cards to move your climbers on the route pictured on the gaming board, or to acclimatize the members of your team.&nbsp;&#10;You can also set up a tent and wait for better weather. You will have to choose your path carefully, as the other mountaineers can block your way, and watch the upcoming weather which can lower your acclimatization to 0, thus killing your climbers.&#10;K2 is a hand management game for 1-5 players, with strong interaction and low luck factor, lasting up to 60 minutes. The theme is very well represented by the mechanics, including such elements as changing weather, lack of oxygen and death of the mountaineers. The result is an exciting match for gamers and non-gamers alike.&#10;The box includes, among other materials, a double-sided board with two different routes to the summit (easier and harder) and two sets of weather tiles (for summer and winter).&#10;&#10;	\N	1	5	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/JlUNpGfe_k7FSYLTrh0ovw__original/img/Pq687MoRM6SD6gzbPhriL3JcM00=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5875489.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/JlUNpGfe_k7FSYLTrh0ovw__thumb/img/jYzh0MuH2xTed0d4z8kNNCXLqsM=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5875489.jpg

On your turn, you will perform one of eight actions and acquire pillars of civilization.&#10;&#10;Acquiring pillars is important in creating the unique mosaic of your civilization. They are used as prerequisites for many new technologies, as well as for scoring. Also, by pursuing specialization in one or more civilization pillars, you may be able to claim a &lsquo;Golden Age&rsquo; of that type.&#10;&#10;As the game goes on and your civilization grows, scoring cards are eventually revealed from the four decks. Each time a scoring card is revealed, your civilization will score for each region that you dominate with your cities, towns, wonders, and military units. After the third scoring card is revealed, there is one final turn and the game ends. You will then score for your cities and towns, your wonders, projects, achievments, and golden ages, and for all of your cards that score for your unique civilization pillars.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher (corrected and updated)&#10;&#10;Please note that the solo rules are only included in the Kickstarter editions, not in the retail versions (although they are available as print-and-play in French at the very least).&#10;&#10;	\N	2	6	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/hRym3ngIdndJT2hhOURjMw__original/img/wnMrlWn4cdXgkG3fB1JYDqFNqJc=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic7414594.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/hRym3ngIdndJT2hhOURjMw__thumb/img/XWJj-SqoPA1eh6u7KUY1j3nSEA8=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7414594.jpg

Room tiles representing slot machines, lounges, restaurants, and other casino-related places appear on a central board and the players hold auctions to win the rights to have those rooms in their building, garnering them income, population, or fame.

1163	483	Diplomacy	This classic game of pure negotiation has taken many forms over the years.&#10;&#10;The first The Avalon Hill Game Co version has perhaps the widest release, but Avalon Hill re-released the game in 1999, complete with a colorful new map and metal pieces.  In 2008, Avalon Hill released a 50th anniversary edition with a new map and cardboard pieces representing the armies and navies.&#10;&#10;In the game, players represent one of the seven &quot;Great Powers of Europe&quot; (Great Britain, France, Austria-Hungary, Germany, Italy, Russia or Turkey) in the years prior to World War I. Play begins in the Spring of 1901, and players make both Spring and Autumn moves each year. There are only two kinds of military units: armies and fleets. On any given turn, each of your military units has limited options: they can move into an adjoining territory, support an allied unit in an attack on an adjoining territory, support an allied unit in defending an adjoining territory, or hold their position. Players instruct each of their units by writing a set of &quot;orders.&quot; The outcome of each turn is determined by the rules of the game. There are no dice rolls or other elements of chance. With its incredibly simplistic movement mechanics fused to a significant negotiation element, this system is highly respected by many gamers.&#10;&#10;Avalon Hill Complexity rating - 3&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;    Colonial Diplomacy&#10;    Diplomacy: Classical Variant&#10;    Diplomacy: Hundred Variant&#10;&#10;&#10;	\N	2	7	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/CGJihifkrZSqW40zElgXkQ__original/img/m38u19fIxQceN0fJtLU3O31MhXw=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic7376874.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/CGJihifkrZSqW40zElgXkQ__thumb/img/_Ar945YdaXSz3iFIR_aOCCcf6zc=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7376874.jpg

Can Robin Hood and his companions escape the sheriff's guards and complete their adventures successfully?&#10;&#10;In The Adventures of Robin Hood, players take on the role of Robin Hood and his companions, with the action taking place on a living game board with no set paths.

1169	202670	Ticket to Ride: Rails & Sails	Ticket to Ride: Rails &amp; Sails takes the familiar gameplay of Ticket to Ride and expands it across the globe &mdash; which means that you'll be moving across water, of course, and that's where the sails come in.&#10;&#10;As in other Ticket to Ride games, in Ticket to Ride: Rails &amp; Sails players start with tickets in hand that show two cities, and over the course of the game they try to collect colored cards, then claim routes on the game board with their colored train and ship tokens, scoring points while doing so. When any player has six or fewer tokens in their supply, each player takes two more turns, then the game ends. At that point, if they've created a continuous path between the two cities on a ticket, then they score the points on that ticket; if not, then they lose points instead.&#10;&#10;Ticket to Ride: Rails &amp; Sails puts a few twists on the TtR formula, starting with split card decks of trains and ships (with all of the wild cards going in the train deck). Three cards of each type are revealed at the start of the game, and when you draw cards, you replace them with a card from whichever deck you like. (Shuffle the card types separately to form new decks when needed.)&#10;&#10;Similarly, players choose their own mix of train and ship tokens at the start of the game. To claim a train route (rectangular spaces), you must play train cards (or wilds) and cover those spaces with train tokens, and to claim a ship route (oval spaces), you must play ship cards (or wilds) and cover those spaces with ship tokens. Ship cards depict one or two ships on them, and when you play a double-ship card, you can cover one or two ship spaces. You can take an action during play to swap train tokens for ships (or vice versa), and you lose one point for each token you swap.&#10;&#10;Some tickets show tour routes with multiple cities instead of simply two cities. If you build a network that matches the tour exactly, you score more points than if you simply include all of those cities in your network.&#10;&#10;Each player also starts the game with three harbors. If you have built a route to a port city, you can take an action during the game to place a harbor in that city (with a limit of one harbor per port). To place the harbor, you must discard two train cards and two ship cards of the same color, all of which must bear the harbor symbol (an anchor). At the end of the game, you lose four points for each harbor not placed, and you gain 10-40 points for each placed harbor depending on how many of your completed tickets show that port city.&#10;&#10;Ticket to Ride: Rails &amp; Sails includes a double-sided game board, with one side showing the world and the other side showing the Great Lakes of North America. Players start with a differing number of cards and tokens depending on which side they play, and each side has a few differences in gameplay.&#10;&#10;Part of Ticket to Ride series.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	5	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/KaTRZHY0XpW-ZSgjaRNzmg__original/img/3XLzbo_56PB-0PVjHlCn4YLq1d8=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3066862.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/KaTRZHY0XpW-ZSgjaRNzmg__thumb/img/gGMP1QhYWoI6w3Y1p3BarUNuwRg=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3066862.jpg

1171	220517	The Shipwreck Arcana	Trapped in a drowned world, you and your allies are doomed -- or are you? Using a mystical deck and a healthy dose of logic, you can predict each others' fates and escape unscathed.&#10;&#10;The Shipwreck Arcana is a compact, co-operative game of deduction, evaluation, and logic. Each player's doom constantly changes as they draw numbered fate tiles from the bag. By choosing which fate to give up and which card to play it on, you can give your allies enough information to identify the fate you're holding...which is important, as the active player cannot communicate with their allies during their turn!&#10;&#10;Each card has strict rules governing what fates can be played on it. As doom builds up, the cards themselves fade, becoming one-time powers to help the players while new cards cycle in from the deck.&#10;&#10;Skilled play requires carefully rationing powers, hints, and cycling, while paying attention to not only where each fate was played -- but more importantly, where it wasn't.&#10;&#10;The rotating active player creates a different group dynamic each turn, preventing any one player from dominating the game. Inexperienced players can still use the group deduction phase to ask questions (while they are not the active player).&#10;&#10;	\N	2	5	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/yv5EAl5uidhZ53WJI-bQ4g__original/img/M7dWeql-u4Xtcaff5tfSCa2AvSs=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic4042715.png	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/yv5EAl5uidhZ53WJI-bQ4g__thumb/img/97sqsQ6PTxfoHXd12xQG0hl0pqE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4042715.png
1184	291845	Three Sisters	Three Sisters is a strategic roll-and-write game about backyard farming. Three Sisters is named after an indigenous agricultural technique still widely used today in which three different crops &mdash; pumpkins, corn, and beans &mdash; are planted close together. Corn provides a lattice for beans to climb, the beans bring nitrogen from the air into the soil, and the squash provides a natural mulch ground cover to reduce weeds and keep pests away.&#10;&#10;In the game, you have your own player sheet with multiple areas: the garden, which is divided into six numbered zones, each containing the three crop types; the apiary; compost; perennials; goods; fruit; and the shed, which is filled with tools that have special abilities. All the crops, fruits, flowers, and hives are represented by tracks that you will mark off as you acquire these items. Many of the tracks are interconnected with other elements in the game, giving you bonuses along the way. A common feature of these tracks are circles that represent a harvest, which generates goods; get enough goods, and you unlock bonus actions. Advancing on all of these tracks offers various amounts of points, advancements, and bonuses.&#10;&#10;The game lasts eight rounds. Each round, roll dice based on the number of players, group them by number, then place them on an action space of the circular action wheel, starting with the current position of the farmer; the farmer moves each round, which means that dice showing 1s, 2s, etc. will end up on different spaces each round. Once the dice have been placed, each player drafts one die and uses it as described below. Once everyone has drafted a die, all players get to use the lowest-valued die remaining on the action wheel. A die lets you do two things, which you can do in either order:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Plant or water the numbered zone matching the value of the die.&#10;     Take the action of the space from which you removed the die.&#10;&#10;&#10;To plant, you mark the bottom space of two empty crop tracks. (Note that you can't plant beans until the corn adjacent to the beans is tall enough to support them.) To water, you mark one space in all the crop tracks that already have at least one mark in them. As for the actions on the action wheel, you can:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Plant or water again in the same numbered zone.&#10;     Gain one compost (which lets you adjust die values) and four goods (which will get you bonuses at the farmer's market).&#10;     Mark off the hive track, which can bring you points, goods, or bonus actions.&#10;     Mark one of the four fruit tracks. Each fruit is worth different points and different amounts of goods and has different track lengths and circle positions.&#10;     Visit the farmer's market, which gives you points and bonuses based on the number of goods you've collected.&#10;     Mark one of the fifteen tool tracks in your shed. As soon as you complete a track, you gain that power or end-game scoring opportunity.&#10;&#10;&#10;Perennials don't have a direct action associated with them and are marked off only through actions in other areas, with the various perennials giving different bonuses as you mark them.&#10;&#10;At the end of the round, all players receive a bonus action, either rain that waters all numbered zones in your garden, a trip to the shed, or a visit to the farmer's market. After eight rounds, you score points for harvested crops, perennials, the apiary, fruit, and some shed items. Whoever has the most points wins.&#10;&#10;Three Sisters has a solo mode in which you try to top your own score against an &quot;opponent&quot; that drafts dice and blocks areas of your sheet.&#10;&#10;	\N	1	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Z1ihG_FHEKuf1Et53f2Dzg__original/img/eMBOJ52H8z_POdRRC6_DKRIIp78=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic6349029.png	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Z1ihG_FHEKuf1Et53f2Dzg__thumb/img/3LXpXcuoBQGQACl-Yw4fGqls2GM=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6349029.png
1172	337765	Brian Boru: High King of Ireland	In Brian Boru: High King of Ireland, you strive to unite Ireland under your domain, securing control through might, cunning, and matrimony. Join forces to fend off Viking invaders, build monasteries to extend your influence, and gather support in towns and villages throughout the land. To become High King of all Ireland, you need to navigate a web of shifting alliances, outmaneuver your enemies, and grab history by the reins.&#10;&#10;The success of the historical Brian Boru rested on three pillars: his victories against the Vikings, the favor he managed to garner with the Church, and the alliances he forged through political marriages. This became the foundation of the game, with each pillar becoming a suit in the trick-taking that forms the core of the mechanisms. Win a trick and you gain influence in a town, which, in turn, gains you majorities in the regions; if you lose the trick, however (deliberately or otherwise), you instead take an action corresponding to the suit of the card.&#10;&#10;	\N	3	5	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/S-Ro5X2B6x2V6bana2f0fA__original/img/m09hR2xEAKWjfYuJge5vWOnqJCA=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic6149105.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/S-Ro5X2B6x2V6bana2f0fA__thumb/img/vMUxc-cwNH-PMKaDgWx0HAjJFDQ=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6149105.jpg

1174	168435	Between Two Cities	It is the early 1800s, a time of immense construction and urbanization. You are a world-renowned master city planner who has been asked to redesign two different cities. Projects of such significance require the expertise of more than one person, so for each assignment you are paired with a partner with whom to discuss and execute your grandiose plans. Will your planning and collaborative skills be enough to design the most impressive city in the world?&#10;&#10;Between Two Cities is a partnership-driven tile-drafting game in which each tile represents part of a city: factory, shop, park, landmarks, etc. You work with the player on your left to design the heart of one city, and with the player on your right to design the heart of another city. On each turn you select two tiles from hand, reveal them, then work with your partners separately to place one of those tiles into each of your two cities before passing the remaining hand of tiles around the table.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, each city is scored for its livability. Your final score is the lower of the livability scores of the two cities you helped design. To win, you have to share your attention and your devotion between two cities. The player with the highest final score wins the game.&#10;&#10;The game features play for 3-7 players in 20-25 minutes, a 2-player variant for head-to-head competition as well as a solo variant (Automa).&#10;&#10;	\N	1	7	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/7KO73MdSD1yCUvKmb4pOgA__original/img/Z1jHr2yyOS982h3F5IktoEYTxeU=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic6352795.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/7KO73MdSD1yCUvKmb4pOgA__thumb/img/BaLQhhGkNB6LaNqGnaNzz88GLOA=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6352795.jpg

1177	271601	Feed the Kraken	Feed the Kraken is a hidden role deduction game, with three asymmetric factions. All players may be sitting in the same boat, but they want to navigate in different directions! The loyal sailors must bring the ship safely to mainland, whereas the pirates crave to secretly maneuver the ship into the Bermuda Triangle. Meanwhile a crazy cultist is busy convincing parts of the crew to help him summon their dark lord &mdash;the Kraken&mdash; from the depth of the sea to save them all.&#10;&#10;The goal of the game is to navigate the ship towards your final destination, which would be easy if only players weren&rsquo;t divided into three different factions. Each secret faction wants to reach a different area of the board. Every turn the ship will sail in one of the three possible directions &mdash;but which one will it be? The current captain and their chosen lieutenant will study ancient sea maps and pass their often conflicting orders onto the chosen navigator, who has to make the final decision. Meanwhile the rest of the crew is busy drinking rum, gambling and telling each other tales of ancient sea monsters.&#10;&#10;After each navigation, the lieutenant and navigator go off duty, and the captain has to find somebody sober enough to take their spot instead. Everyone can discuss, how well that last navigation went, who is to blame for the current course, and who should be in charge in the future instead. Convince your enemies that it is in their best interest to make you the next lieutenant, or navigator! You can even draw your guns and become the new captain in open mutiny! But for how long will you be able to keep the trust of your crew? The next mutiny might already be waiting for you if your decisions don&rsquo;t please your fellow sailors.&#10;&#10;Feed the Kraken is a sophisticated social deduction game designed around a beautiful vintage sailor setting. It supports 5-11 players. A match is usually dealt within 45 minutes up to 1:30 hours.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from designer&#10;&#10;	\N	5	11	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/iiLwb5kt1h7yb9So-F95Fg__original/img/hG5LQvlsHyDOSOEqNFa8LqX4v1Q=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic5735695.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/iiLwb5kt1h7yb9So-F95Fg__thumb/img/PWg3soWPzau0P1FMtoRzOdmo3TA=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5735695.jpg

The cities and villages of the region intend to take advantage of this expansion. Caravans loaded with goods and jewels set out for the desert, bearing the promises of a radiant future....&#10;&#10;The players embody merchants trading with Yspahan. Meaning to take advantage of the coming of the Shah&rsquo;s supervisor, they score points by placing their merchandise in the right shops, by sending them to the caravan, and by constructing buildings.&#10;&#10;In Yspahan, players draft their action for the turn in order, but a roll of the dice determines which actions are available and how powerful they will be. You can earn points in the short-term by claiming shops in the city or by sending your traders to the caravan. You can also improve your infrastructure by constructing buildings that improve your actions or picking up action cards that give you extra options.

1179	11825	Empire of the Sun	(from GMT website:)&#10;&#10;Empire of the Sun (EotS) is Mark Herman's third card driven design since he introduced the system to the hobby in We The People. EotS is a strategic level look at the entire War in the Pacific from the attack on Pearl Harbor until the surrender of Japan. EotS is the first card driven game (CDG) to move the system closer to a classic hexagon wargame, while retaining all of the tension and uncertainty people have come to expect from a CDG. Players are cast in the role of MacArthur, Yamamoto, Nimitz, and Mountbatten as you direct your forces across the breadth of the globe from India to Hawaii and from Alaska to Australia. This is represented on a single map based on a 1942 equal area projection of the entire theater of conflict.&#10;&#10;As in other games using the CDG system, players try to maximize the impact of their cards even as they hide their intentions and traps from their opponent. The player is faced with a wide set of clear strategic choices. The focus of EotS is on directing major offensive axes of advance. The Japanese early in the game are challenged to achieve their historical expansion as Allied forces battle the clock to react with their in-place forces trying to achieve maximum damage to the hard-to-replace Japanese veteran units.&#10;&#10;Combat in EotS is based on successfully bringing superior combined land, air, and sea forces to bear in a two-tiered combat system. The first tier is the resolution of air-naval combat, the second tier covers ground combat. The culmination of both tiers results in one side prevailing in battle.&#10;&#10;The key variable in determining strategic victory is the level of U.S. political will. The Japanese win the game by forcing the U.S. into a negotiated peace, which was not achieved historically. The Japanese achieve this by knocking countries like India, China, and Australia out of the war, while inflicting massive casualties on the United States. The delivery of the A-bomb on its historical schedule is not a guarantee, often necessitating Operation Olympic and the invasion of Japan. It is often in its darkest hour that the Japanese find victory in EotS.&#10;EotS scenarios were designed with the busy enthusiast, grognard, and competitive tournament player in mind. EotS was designed to be played n yearly scenarios (1942, 1943, and 1944) of three turns each that play in under two hours. If you are a fan of CDG's, EotS takes the genre into a familiar, but new direction. If you are a fan of classic hexagon wargames, this game has all of the features that brought you to this hobby in the first place, but with a new level of excitement and replayability. The game is comprehensive, but easy to learn.&#10;&#10;TIME SCALE: 4 months per turn&#10;MAP SCALE: 150 miles per hex&#10;UNIT SCALE: Brigade, Division, Corps, and Army&#10;&#10;DESIGNER: Mark Herman&#10;DEVELOPER: Stephen Newberg&#10;MAP &amp; CARD ART: Mark Simonitch&#10;COUNTER ART: Mark Simonitch, Dave Lawrence, &amp; Rodger B. MacGowan&#10;&#10;&#10;(from the designer:)&#10;&#10;Empire of the Sun (EOTS), uses a variant of my card driven system. The game has one map that covers the Pacific Theater of operations from India to Hawaii, and from the Aleutians to Australia. EOTS is the first card driven game to use hexes, which facilitates calculating movement and aircraft ranges. Each game turn covers 4 months (three turns per year) with a special December 41 (special two card) game turn, for a total of 12 game turns for the campaign.&#10;&#10;The game is at the strategic level using naval units built around a capital ship class (e.g., CV Wasp, BB Washington, etc.), air units at the Air Force/ Air Flotilla/ Air Division level, and most ground units are Corps/ Armies although there are a host of specialized units at the division and below level. The game has 165 cards divided into an Allied and a Japanese deck.&#10;&#10;The game uses a two tiered combat system with air-naval combat preceding ground combat. The system has players roll for combat efficiency, which is a strength multiplier from .5 to 2. This value multiplied by the unit strengths is the number of hits the enemy takes in combat, with some special conditions based on number of CVs present and the like.&#10;&#10;As far as game play is concerned, China is abstracted using a track whereby the play of certain events and Chinese offensives puts pressure on the Allies to support this theater with resources or see it fall and hurt Allied morale. This is balanced against the fact that Japanese land replacements come from this theater, so the more they draw it down for conflict in other locations, the more likely China will survive.&#10;&#10;Northern India and Burma are active theaters of operation where the majority of the continuous ground warfare in the game occurs. If the Japanese can successfully occupy Northern India, they can drive this nation and its Commonwealth units out of the war.&#10;&#10;Australia can also be knocked out of the war, although it is hard to keep it out permanently.&#10;&#10;Then of course there is the famous island campaigns with the US driving across the Pacific to knock Japan out of the war.&#10;&#10;	\N	1	2	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/FsZ3b-WSPdfGGMDHSyAE9A__original/img/zIvuWc5uivN3b63CtLTy3O1HtEI=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2365509.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/FsZ3b-WSPdfGGMDHSyAE9A__thumb/img/J9odWh1lkqbFXUWp99Ayz8iRva0=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2365509.jpg

1181	214887	CO₂: Second Chance	In the 1970s, the governments of the world faced unprecedented demand for energy, and polluting power plants were built everywhere in order to meet that demand. Year after year, the pollution they generate increases, and nobody has done anything to reduce it. Now, the impact of this pollution has become too great, and humanity is starting to realize that we must meet our energy demands through clean sources of energy. Companies with expertise in clean, sustainable energy are called in to propose projects that will provide the required energy without polluting the environment. Regional governments are eager to fund these projects and to invest in their implementation.&#10;&#10;If the pollution isn't stopped, it's game over for all of us.&#10;&#10;In the game CO&#226;&#130;&#130;, each player is the CEO of an energy company responding to government requests for new, green power plants. The goal is to stop the increase of pollution while meeting the rising demand for sustainable energy &mdash; and of course profiting from doing so. You will need enough expertise, money, and resources to build these clean power plants. Energy summits will promote global awareness, and allow companies to share a little of their expertise while learning still more from others.&#10;&#10;In CO&#226;&#130;&#130;, each region starts with a certain number of carbon emissions permits (CEPs) at its disposal. These CEPs are granted by the United Nations, and they must be spent whenever the region needs to install the energy infrastructure for a project or to construct a fossil fuel power plant. CEPs can be bought and sold on a market, and their price fluctuates throughout the game. You will want to try to maintain control over the CEPs.&#10;&#10;Money, CEPs, green power plants that you've built, UN goals you've completed, company goals you've met, and expertise you've gained all give you victory points (VPs), which represent your company's reputation &mdash; and having the best reputation is the goal of the game &hellip; in addition to saving the planet, of course.&#10;&#10;This new totally re-designed edition of CO&#226;&#130;&#130; features a completely new iconography, an entirely new rulebook with lots of 3D pictures for easy comprehension of the rules, more balanced gameplay, a new events deck, improved and streamlined mechanisms, and upgraded wooden components for the power plants instead of the cardboard tokens in a game with a shorter play length. This version also features a co-operative mode of play as well as solo play based on goals.&#10;&#10;	\N	1	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/giSEjstTofNSRnu1A2kPeA__original/img/TK2VWdLEh-tmqVuWMCYcmEHgiM0=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4543193.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/giSEjstTofNSRnu1A2kPeA__thumb/img/0ieYP05iPs5KcD1hY5fVOuxvOqI=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4543193.jpg
1182	41	Can't Stop	In this Sid Sackson classic, players must press their luck with dice and choose combinations tactically to close out three columns. The board has one column for each possible total of two six-sided dice, but the number of spaces in each column varies: the more probable a total, the more spaces in that column and the more rolls it takes to complete. On their turn, a player rolls four dice and arranges them in duos: 1 4 5 6 can become 1+4 and 5+6 for 5 &amp; 11, 1+5 and 4+6 for 6 &amp; 10, or 1+6 and 4+5 for 7 &amp; 9. The player places or advances progress markers in the open column(s) associated with their chosen totals, then chooses whether to roll again or end their turn and replace the progress markers with markers of their color. A player can only advance three different columns in a turn and cannot advance a column which any player has closed out by reaching the end space; if a roll doesn&rsquo;t result in any legal plays, the turn ends with that turn&rsquo;s progress lost.&#10;&#10;A predecessor from 1974, The Great Races, exists as a paper-and-pencil game.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/nMitZr9Lu4Ux7LLqBy7Z8A__original/img/A_bSjGJJXDFfSocVclabxi8ArY8=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic6875169.png	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/nMitZr9Lu4Ux7LLqBy7Z8A__thumb/img/mLHWOFfdxrWljImkFZ2ulIhHt7A=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6875169.png
1183	3307	Wallenstein	Historically, Albrecht von Wallenstein, duke of Friedland and Mecklenburg, was one of the most important mercenary commanders of the Imperial army during the Thirty Years' War (1618-48). His overweening ambition was to head a large central European empire, which got him dismissed in 1630. Such was his power, however, that the empire was forced to reinstate him when Sweden came into the fray. He recovered Bohemia, but was defeated by Gustavus Adolphus at L&uuml;tzen, and was again dismissed. His subsequent intrigues with Protestant forces alarmed the Catholic princes who were probably complicit in his assassination in 1634 by Irish mercenaries at Eger, Bohemia.&#10;&#10;The game begins with the start of the war, each player controlling several countries. Player actions include the conquest of new countries, tax collection, erection of buildings (i.e. development of the economy), feeding the populace, victualing the army, etc. Some actions increase the chance for unrest, and expensive rebellions can occur. The strongest power at the end wins.&#10;&#10;Employs the cube tower included in the publisher's previous game, Im Zeichen des Kreuzes.&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;    Shogun&#10;    Wallenstein (Second Edition)&#10;&#10;&#10;	\N	3	5	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/WRrzW58eKeIWP1JxIiw2RQ__original/img/w_lvbrzX4mSYadLo-jnD3r-UFns=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic358092.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/WRrzW58eKeIWP1JxIiw2RQ__thumb/img/ufkxSGYcVTbolW6avXuxOmaxMcQ=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic358092.jpg
1185	256382	Disney Villainous	In Villainous, each player takes control of one of six Disney characters, each one a villain in a different Disney movie. Each player has their own villain deck, fate deck, player board, and 3D character.&#10;&#10;On a turn, the active player moves their character to a different location on their player board, takes one or more of the actions visible on that space (often by playing cards from their hand), then refills their hand to four cards. Cards are allies, items, effects, conditions, and (for some characters) curses. You need to use your cards to fulfill your unique win condition.&#10;&#10;One of the actions allows you to choose another player, draw two cards from that player's fate deck, then play one of them on that player's board, covering two of the four action spaces on one of that player's locations. The fate deck contains heroes, items, and effects from that villain's movie, and these cards allow other players to mess with that particular villain.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	6	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/7Ej5V5Dq92QdvVFvISfl_A__original/img/XHykA7cqZ0F4tYiKXw095TvHRno=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4216110.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/7Ej5V5Dq92QdvVFvISfl_A__thumb/img/8tU6KCVSI5dlcibYTT6mq3K9ljk=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4216110.jpg

On the player's next turn, they will move that Action Card ahead of all the others and choose a different action.&#10;&#10;If a player completes a ship on their turn (ships consists of little cards depicting bows, sterns, and (preferably several) middle pieces with several options to add equipment or crew), it is taken out for a shakedown cruise in a canal, during which they may score points for speed, crew, equipment, or safety.&#10;&#10;As players take their turns, the line of Action Cards will advance around the Action Track. When the lead Action Card reaches the Starting Space again, the countdown marker moves down one space, and play continues.&#10;&#10;The game ends when the countdown marker reaches the finish space. (It can also end early if the players run out of Ship Cards.) Bonus points are scored for Government Contracts, and the player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;The game lasts about 30 minutes per player.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/sPgjX2_W4XDpE0SUv82HsQ__original/img/Kw1kfAqulSU1lxpSFRhWCH7i1Ns=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1809442.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/sPgjX2_W4XDpE0SUv82HsQ__thumb/img/Hal-DG2J9KHoaonkfQK-BU0HUZA=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1809442.jpg
1189	68425	Eminent Domain	Survey the galaxy to expand your civilization &ndash; will you colonize nearby planets, or take them over by force? Harvest resources for trade, and do research to improve your technology. Build the best civilization and win the game!&#10;&#10;Eminent Domain is a civilization-building game in which your civilization's abilities are based on a deck of Role cards. At the beginning of the game each player has the same deck of cards, with just two cards for each Role in it. Every turn you must choose a Role to execute (and like Glory to Rome or Puerto Rico, your opponents will get a chance to follow suit), and in doing so you will add one of those Role cards to your deck. When executing a Role, you can boost its effect by playing cards out of your hand matching the Role you have chosen. For example, the more you Research, the better you get at Researching (because you'll have more Research cards in your deck).&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Dn3gJBq-k8Zww4a5yCzgOQ__original/img/YnPZaUDPp02cINzXYfhdJ_5f4H4=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1160506.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Dn3gJBq-k8Zww4a5yCzgOQ__thumb/img/IuAN5frtRpuyA5ZyueUdG3_DMxs=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1160506.jpg
1190	244608	Menara	As a tight-knit team in Menara, players use pillars and wondrously-shaped temple floors to build a spectacularly soaring structure full of nooks and crannies. Cooperation and static skills are in demand since for each mistake in construction, you have to add another floor to the temple.&#10;&#10;A steady hand, an alert mind, and mutual assistance can help you successfully complete what seems to top out at dizzy heights...&#10;&#10;	\N	1	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/qRwLtZZDhIT1wPD8qjCEUA__original/img/DWcprkKsOtSABH4zfsuD_LI26G0=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3944407.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/qRwLtZZDhIT1wPD8qjCEUA__thumb/img/M7GGgc8cAX5AiTfdC8U4AieR6VQ=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3944407.jpg
1191	255692	New Frontiers	In New Frontiers, a standalone game in the Race for the Galaxy family, players build galactic empires by selecting, in turn, an action that everyone may do, with only the selecting player gaining that action's bonus.&#10;&#10;The developments to be used are determined during setup, allowing players to make strategic plans based on them before play begins. One group of eight developments is always in play. The game includes a suggested set of sixteen additional developments for your first game; in later games, players randomly select which side of eight double-sided &quot;small&quot; developments and eight double-sided &quot;large&quot; 9-cost developments to use during setup.&#10;&#10;Many worlds that players can acquire have special powers, with these worlds being drawn from a bag during the Explore phase. Unlike in Race, in New Frontiers worlds need colonists to be settled, in addition to either payments or conquest.&#10;&#10;Some worlds are &quot;windfall&quot; worlds and receive a good upon being settled. Others are production worlds and receive goods when the Produce action is selected. Goods can be traded for credits or consumed for victory points.&#10;&#10;Play continues until one or more of four game ending conditions is reached. After all actions for that round have been done, the player with the most victory points from settled worlds, developments, 9-cost development bonuses, and VP chips earned from consuming goods wins.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	5	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/yiBNj7FQx_H_Q0JSJLwycw__original/img/NHq_4xd8NhHeSx2dGjST68ZSIgo=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4195323.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/yiBNj7FQx_H_Q0JSJLwycw__thumb/img/QGJS7HdKYi7jCt6xn7GRbFyRK50=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4195323.jpg
1192	21882	Blue Moon City	Blue Moon City - the board game - picks up where the two-player game, (Blue Moon), ended: the reconstruction of the destroyed city of Blue Moon. The board, illustrated by Franz Vohwinkel as well as many well-known American fantasy artists, consists of 21 large building tiles, which show building plans on one side and the buildings in their reconstructed glory on the other. As in the 2-player game, the game includes 3 large molded plastic dragons.&#10;&#10;At the start of the game, the board tiles all show their building plan sides. The object of the game is to use cards featuring the races of Blue Moon to help rebuild the city and, at the end, put the large Crystal of the Obelisk in the middle of the city back together. Whenever a building is completely rebuilt, its tile is turned back over to its rebuilt side. The players who helped with a building get crystals and dragon favors, which can be traded in for crystals at certain times.&#10;&#10;The player who first manages to add the required number of markers by paying crystals to the Obelisk wins the game. (four markers in a 4-player game, five markers in a 3-player game, and six markers in a 2-player game)&#10;&#10;There are two mini-expansions for this game (Blue Moon City: Expansion Tile Sets 1 & 2), each consisting of two tiles that can be added to the main game either separately or combined.  The first mini-expansion was included with the Der Knizia Almanach.  The second mini-expansion was included in the 6/06 issue of Spielbox.&#10;&#10;Rules changes&#10;&#10;     Original Knizia design--after dragon scales score, ALL players discard scales.  This rule was modified by the publisher. [citation needed]&#10;     In original printings such as Kosmos and FFG for 4-3-2 players the game uses 15-12-9 dragon scales.  In later edtions new publisher CMON changed this to 12-9-7 scales.&#10;&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/1MRXcnaF8VqPaeIS6cEUDQ__original/img/lEJBqf8knsJjfPOGXtLa7Dc71bA=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4757841.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/1MRXcnaF8VqPaeIS6cEUDQ__thumb/img/sihUuUe4alBkHpkPdUSoDvri3Hs=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4757841.jpg
1193	244228	Reef	In the game Reef, players take on the role of a coral reef, carefully selecting colors and patterns in which to grow and expand. On each turn, players can choose to pick up a new card from a choice of four, or play a card that is already in hand. Each card provides two reef pieces and a pattern that scores points if the existing reef has it (after placing the two new pieces). Whoever has the most points when the reef pieces (or card deck) run out wins!&#10;&#10;Reef is an abstract strategy game suited for players aged 8 and up. While it could take thousands of years for a coral reef to grow, a game of Reef should take only 30-45 minutes.&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/I3BgmkjP3g6cRQ4cejoHrg__original/img/m0FXYQ2cNByp2YXLSK632rcH1_Q=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic5376430.png	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/I3BgmkjP3g6cRQ4cejoHrg__thumb/img/JDWcuLadW0pHSAh7fybzRRXNZZ8=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5376430.png

1195	373106	Sky Team	Sky Team is a co-operative game, exclusively for two players, in which you play a pilot and co-pilot at the controls of an airliner. Your goal is to work together as a team to land your airplane in different airports around the world.&#10;&#10;To land your plane, you need to silently assign your dice to the correct spaces in your cockpit to balance the axis of your plane, control its speed, deploy the flaps, extend the landing gear, contact the control tower to clear your path, and even have a little coffee to improve your concentration enough to change the value of your dice.&#10;&#10;If the aircraft tilts too much and stalls, overshoots the airport, or collides with another aircraft, you lose the game...and your pilot's license...and probably your life.&#10;&#10;From Montreal to Tokyo, each airport offers its own set of challenges. Watch out for the turbulence as this could end up being bumpy ride!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;	\N	2	2	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/uXMeQzNenHb3zK7Hoa6b2w__original/img/mWOQnkpyYBorh_Y1-0Y2o-ew17k=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic7398904.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/uXMeQzNenHb3zK7Hoa6b2w__thumb/img/WyPClajMWU9lV5BdCXiZnqdZgmU=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7398904.jpg
1196	361545	Twilight Inscription	The Lazax Empire has burned to ash, rejected by its subjects. The aftermath was tragedy and petty conflict in equal measure, a time of loss and exhaustion. In the ensuing Dark Years, the factions of the galaxy retreated and recovered their strength. Now, they look upon the stars and see an opportunity&mdash;a chance to reclaim what was lost. A chance to redefine galactic civilization. A chance to leave their mark upon the stars.&#10;&#10;Twilight Inscription, an epic roll-and-write game for one to eight players, offers an experience unlike anything Fantasy Flight Games has done before. With a limited pool of resources at your disposal, you&rsquo;ll need to carefully manage Navigation, Expansion, Industry, and Warfare as you amass victory points and earn your right to the throne on Mecatol Rex. Will your faction become the new rulers of the galaxy? Or will your fledgling empire fade into obscurity? Anything can happen in this strategic, infinitely-replayable game!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;	\N	1	8	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/g36va6ofPCzNZXF-9GEpCg__original/img/W-Goi5-dQP19Nj-MXa8xdEtpnVs=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic7132023.png	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/g36va6ofPCzNZXF-9GEpCg__thumb/img/F8SHn9giBPmooUkmJDz9kXAamS0=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7132023.png
1197	238799	Messina 1347	Messina 1347 takes place during the introduction of the plague epidemic (a.k.a. the &quot;black death&quot;) and the spreading of its infection through town. During this time period, merchant ships delivering luxury goods to Europe brought to these countries an unprecedented epidemic &mdash; and one of the first affected cities was Messina, Italy.&#10;&#10;In the game, players take the role of important Messina families who are leaving town and moving to the countryside out of fear of being infected by the plague. While doing this, they are focusing on saving other inhabitants and helping to fight the plague infection in town. They must also endeavor to prosper in their countryside residence, where they are temporarily accommodating rescued residents. They are all waiting there for the epidemic to subside, then they return to Messina to take over and dominate particular districts in the town.&#10;&#10;	\N	1	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Pw9TGohEb7PITFJnuq48bQ__original/img/W4JriNN41N9CK2e2pQgmz9Ud9bY=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic6397342.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Pw9TGohEb7PITFJnuq48bQ__thumb/img/bWVi55qMYTv6VrQNHFllltHLlZI=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic6397342.jpg
1198	220520	Caverna: Cave vs Cave	In the two-player game Caverna: Cave vs. Cave, each player starts the game with only two dwarves and a small excavation in the side of a mountain. Over the course of eight rounds, they'll double their workforce, open up new living space in the mountain, construct new buildings and rooms in which to live, and dig for precious metals.&#10;&#10;In more detail, each player starts the game with an individual player board that's covered with a random assortment of face-down building/room tiles and only one space. Some tiles are face up and available for purchase at the start of play. Four action tiles lie face up as well. At the start of each of the eight rounds, one new action tile is revealed, then players alternate taking actions, with the number of actions increasing from two up to four over the course of the game. As players excavate their mountainous player board, new building and room tiles are added to the pool; some rooms can be used immediately when acquired, whereas others require the use of an action tile.&#10;&#10;After eight rounds, players tally their points for buildings constructed and gold collected to see who wins.&#10;&#10;	\N	1	2	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/rTlJoKU2lHOZfv1Ad8YvDA__original/img/gZmllkN9eYLyezrjLl8KEGJWlCo=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3505750.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/rTlJoKU2lHOZfv1Ad8YvDA__thumb/img/_fvhogbWyAeMrwGsxmcUIy6yvA8=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3505750.jpg
1199	200147	Kanagawa	1840: In Kanagawa, the great bay of Tokyo, the Master Hokusai decided to open a painting school to share his art with his disciples. You are one of these disciples, and more than anything, you want to prove yourself worthy of the &ldquo;crazy, old artist&rdquo;. Follow his teachings to expand your studio and paint your preferred subjects (Trees, Animals, Characters, Buildings), all while paying attention to the changing of the seasons in order to make the most harmonious print&hellip; the one that will become the work of your lifetime!&#10;&#10;	\N	2	4	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Rr2JrRztCFzzikJ9YL5-Dw__original/img/-v_1QOvedVYSmOkWsmQuROJCHI0=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3105168.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Rr2JrRztCFzzikJ9YL5-Dw__thumb/img/x9MtKEQlcQ_jS-5AVMeZ28NOC0s=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3105168.jpg
1200	158435	Dogs of War	Dogs of War is an elegant game set in a steampunk-influenced renaissance universe. Noble houses engage each other in a series of fierce battles, and it's up to the players and the Dogs of War they control to deploy their private armies in support of whatever house they wish to favor. Clockwork knights and imposing war machines shift the tides of war as they enter the battlefields, but the interest of their Dog of War captains actually lie in the rewards offered by each noble house to its supporters. Each Dog of War has a special ability that helps them claim influence, win battles, or betray the house to which they've sworn allegiance!&#10;&#10;Dogs of War is not a game of pure military power, but rather a game in which deception and betrayal often lead the way to a decisive victory. The goal for the Dogs of War is to earn the most power by the end of the game. Thanks to thoughtful game design and development, there are many ways to achieve this, like defeating other captains in battle, getting rewards from the Houses you help, amassing gold and troops, and most importantly, gaining influence with the most successful Houses.&#10;&#10;	\N	3	5	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/pN_2LoK9ICB6TD5h3QSPAQ__original/img/YC74jSe7Q6VSdSVxcBhdCKtqhwo=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2682914.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/pN_2LoK9ICB6TD5h3QSPAQ__thumb/img/5T3HgkcVHmIDMXEgEi42T_ZyJLg=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2682914.jpg
1201	47185	Warhammer: Invasion	Warhammer: Invasion The Card Game is a two-player card game of intense warfare, clever kingdom management, and epic questing. Players must carefully allocate their resources as they seek to build their kingdom, complete quests, and attack the enemy&rsquo;s capital.&#10;&#10;Set in the rich and diverse Warhammer universe, player's can choose different factions that each have their own style. Will you play the indestructible grudge-bearing Dwarfs, the shrewd and manoeuvrable Empire, the savage and destructive Orcs, or the entropic and mutating forces of Chaos. Or will you cleverly craft an alliance, playing the combined might of the forces of either Order or Destruction?&#10;&#10;Warhammer: Invasion follows a similar model to that of Magic: The Gathering. Players will construct a deck of cards to their liking that they will use to battle against each other by drawing cards and using resources to play them. Cards can consist of monsters or heroes, one-off spells or abilities, and permanent structures, devices, or equipment. However, there are many differences which make W:I very different from Magic. Two of the main differences are in the release model and the ordering of the gameplay area.&#10;&#10;Rather than a blind collecting model, W:I follows Fantasy Flight Games' LCG model. Each expansion or chapter pack is released with the full contents known to the purchaser. Rarity is not a factor.&#10;&#10;Rather than playing your cards into the same area and relying on card draws for resources or extra cards, each player has a 3-zoneCapitol that they must protect and those sides are generally where cards are played. If an opponent causes enough damage to a section of your capitol it is &quot;burned.&quot; If two sides of your capitol are burned you lose. Depending on which side of your capitol you put a card into it will be able to different things. Units and buildings in the Kingdom Zone contribute to your available resource pool while ones in your Quest Zone cotribute to your card draws. Cards played into the Battlefield are used to attack opponents. Also, units in a zone being attacked by an opponent can be used to defend that zone from damage. This adds a large amount of tactical decisions when it comes to playing your cards. You must carefully balance building your economy with the ability to attack and defend.&#10;&#10;Warhammer Invasion LCG Core Set contains:&#10;&#10;* 1 Rulebook&#10;    * 220 Cards representing 4 factions&#10;    * 4 Capital Boards&#10;    * 35 Resource Tokens&#10;    * 60 Damage Tokens&#10;    * 4 Burning Tokens&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Battle Pack Expansion Cycles:&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    &#10;        &#10;1) The Corruption Cycle:&#10;&#10;    The Skavenblight Threat&#10;    Path of the Zealot&#10;    Tooth and Claw&#10;    The Deathmaster's Dance&#10;    The Warpstone Chronicles&#10;    Arcane Fire&#10;&#10;&#10;2) The Enemy Cycle:&#10;&#10;    The Burning of Derricksburg&#10;    The Fall of Karak Grimaz&#10;    The Silent Forge&#10;    Redemption of a Mage&#10;    The Fourth Waystone&#10;    Bleeding Sun&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;        &#10;3) The Morrslieb Cycle:&#10;&#10;    Omens of Ruin&#10;    The Chaos Moon&#10;    The Twin Tailed Comet&#10;    Signs in the Stars&#10;    The Eclipse of Hope&#10;    Fiery Dawn&#10;&#10;&#10;4) The Capital Cycle:&#10;&#10;    The Inevitable City&#10;    Realm of the Phoenix King&#10;    The Iron Rock&#10;    Karaz-a-Karak&#10;    City of Winter&#10;    The Imperial Throne&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;        &#10;5) The Bloodquest Cycle:&#10;&#10;    Rising Dawn&#10;    Fragments of Power&#10;    The Accursed Dead&#10;    Vessel of the Winds&#10;    Portent of Doom&#10;    Shield of the Gods&#10;&#10;&#10;6) The Eternal War Cycle:&#10;&#10;    Days of Blood&#10;    Oaths of Vengeance&#10;    Battle for the Old World&#10;    Glory of Days Past&#10;    The Ruinous Hordes&#10;    Faith and Steel          &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;        &#10;7) Deluxe Expansions:&#10;&#10;    Assault on Ulthuan&#10;    March of the Damned&#10;    Legends&#10;    Cataclysm&#10;    Hidden Kingdoms&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;	\N	2	2	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/FoX0oahWOeBmGrOlsbd0dg__original/img/nEwvMGXdw4Jgby6v2maogzZemmI=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic567135.jpg	https://cf.geekdo-images.com/FoX0oahWOeBmGrOlsbd0dg__thumb/img/P-p4xbNBmUeEzCKQVjlUjPmg8Ng=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic567135.jpg
